; to be persisted, or they can be created as GUID values that must be persisted.

; The Classes correspond to the different asset classifications. These are reflected in the sub-
; directory names where the assets are stored. Typically these tags will match the keys defined
; in the [DirectoryTagger.Classes] configuration. All classes listed here are stripped from the
; path name when computing the logical ID for an asset. For example, if a file is located in
; "some\path\Xbox360\foo.bar" its logical ID is computed as a hash value of "some\path\foo.bar".
; Another asset in "some\path\D3D11\foo.bar" would receive the same logical ID.

; The Assets are a list of asset types (assigned by the MimeTagger) that should have logical
; asset id's assigned to them. If the asset does not possess one of these tags, then no logical
; asset id is created for it.  Logical asset id's are only needed for assets that will be referenced
; by other asset files, like block or model files.
