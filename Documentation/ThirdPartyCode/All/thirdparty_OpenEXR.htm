<h1>Third Party Code - OpenEXR</h1>

<h2>Version</h2>

<p>OpenEXR 1.6.1 (including IlmBase 1.0.1): <a href="http://www.openexr.com/"
target="_blank">http://www.openexr.com/</a></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by
Industrial Light &amp; Magic for use in computer imaging applications.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The Gamebryo half float code found in <span class="NDLSystemFont">efd</span>
and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSystem</span> files:</p>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Source\Foundation\efd\Float16.*</span></p>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Source\CoreRuntime\EngineLibs\NiSystem\NiFloat16.*</span></p>

<p>is based upon Industrial Light &amp; Magic's half class found in the OpenEXR
distribution. The specific license information for that class is provided here
as well as in the source.</p>

<p>Emergent also uses the OpenEXR library to parse OpenEXR images in the
NiOpenEXRReader library.</p>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Source\CoreRuntime\ToolLibs\NiOpenEXRReader\*.*</span></p>

<p>The license for OpenEXR is described below.</p>

<p>Emergent Game Technologies believes that it is in full compliance with the
terms of the license for the portions of the engine that include and make use
of the code.</p>
