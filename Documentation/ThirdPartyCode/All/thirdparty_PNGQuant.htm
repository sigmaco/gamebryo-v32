<h1>Third Party Code - PNGQuant</h1>

<h2>Version</h2>

<p>1.0 <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/apps/pngquant.html" target=
"_blank">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/apps/pngquant.html</a></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>pngquant is a simple tool with one purpose: convert 32-bit RGBA PNGs into
8-bit RGBA-palette PNGs (or fewer than 8 bits, if you want), via quantization
and either ordered or diffusion (Floyd-Steinberg) dithering. The fact that you
can also use it on RGB or even palette images (e.g., to further color- reduce
them to 16 colors or whatever) is just a nice little bonus.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>This library is used to assist in pixel data conversion into 8-bit pixel
data.</p>

<p>Emergent Game Technologies believes that it is in full compliance with the
terms of the license for the portions of the engine that include and make use
of this code.</p>

<h2>License</h2>

<p>The quantization and dithering code is lifted from Jef Poskanzer's ppmquant,
part of his wonderful PBMPLUS tool suite. I hacked it into a slightly cheesy
"pamquant" back in 1997 (http://pobox.com/~newt/greg_rgba.html) and finally
ripped out the cheesy file-I/O parts and replaced them with nice PNG code in
December 2000. The PNG reading and writing code is a merged and slightly
simplified version of readpng, readpng2, and writepng from my book, "PNG: The
Definitive Guide." pngquant therefore inherits both licenses, one for each
source file. (Note that both licenses are basically BSD-like; that is, use the
code however you like, as long as you acknowledge its origins.)</p>
