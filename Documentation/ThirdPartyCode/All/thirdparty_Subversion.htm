<h1>Third Party Code - Subversion</h1>

<h2>Version</h2>

<p>1.6.2 <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=8100" target=
"_blank">http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=8100</a></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Subversion is an open source revision control system. This system allows multiple local or
remote people to collaborate on a shared set of files. A key feature of revision control is the
ability to record incremental changes between files and rollback to previous versions.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Toolbench can optionally use Subversion to <a href=
"../../Tools/Toolbench/tb_scm_intro.htm">revision control</a> asset web files. The code that
interfaces directly with the Subversion API is wrapped in a plug-in DLL (see <a href=
"../../Reference/etkRCSSVN/etk__RCSSVN.htm">etkRCSSVN</a>). Toolbench exposes some revision control
functionality through its UI to improve the user experience.</p>

<p>The Subversion source is not included with the Gamebryo LightSpeed SDK. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">etkRCSSVN</span> DLLs included with the SDK are linked with the Subversion
libraries. Rebuilding the <span class="NDLSystemFont">etkRCSSVN</span> plug-in requires the
Subversion SDK to be downloaded from the Subversion web site (see above).</p>
