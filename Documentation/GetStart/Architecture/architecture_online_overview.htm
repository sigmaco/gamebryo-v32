<h1>Online Overview</h1>

<p>The Online subsystem provides support for entity replication, remote behavior invocation, and interest management. Replication uses a publish-subscribe methodology to efficiently update entity properties between multiple processes. A process can express interest in specific sets of properties on specific categories of entities. This allows an efficient subset of the total data to be automatically synchronized. One process retains authoritative ownership of each entity to prevent difficult data synchronization bugs.</p>

<p>For example, a game might contain an Entity with many properties. Some of those properties might change frequently, and some might change rarely or never. Some peers in a multiplayer game might be interested in different properties at different times. You might always be interested in the health of a teammate and what region he is in. But you might only be interested in his exact position when he is close to you. If health and region are properties, then they could be put in one update group. Exact position could be put in another. You would always be subscribed to the Category for the group with health and region, but you would only subscribe to the Category for the group with exact position when you are near your teammate. This would allow you to save bandwidth and processing by not receiving updates for properties you are not interested in.</p>

<p>Entities are owned by a single process, but they are replicated to all interested processes. An Entity that is owned by one process can read the properties of an Entity that is owned by another process (remotely owned Entity). This is similar to how it would read the properties of a locally owned Entity. The replication system provides every interested process with a local read-only copy of any remote Entities that the process may be interested in.</p>
  
<p>Entities can also interact by telling one another to invoke selected entity behaviors, which are then run on the target Entity. The system also supports simultaneous behavior invocation on multiple Entities by sending the request on a Category that is being consumed by each of those Entities. For example, an Entity that wants to do damage to a specific Entity can invoke a DoDamage behavior on that specific Entity. An Entity that wants to do an area of effect attack on a specific area would send the damage behavior to the Category representing that area. Every Entity in that area would be responsible for subscribing to the appropriate Category and would then receive any area of effect behaviors.</p>
