<h1>About the Message System</h1>

<p>Gamebryo LightSpeed's <a href="../../Programmer/Messages/message_intro.htm">Message System</a>
abstracts both remote and local messaging. Whatever object subscribed for a given message type will
have its handler method called whether a message was sent remotely or locally. This greatly
simplifies reconfiguring your application across multiple processes without refactoring.</p>

<p>A message is usually subclassed by the application with application-specific data added and
given a unique Class ID. The application is responsible for implementing marshaling code, using
Foundation libraries and the base message class methods when the message needs to be transmitted
over the network. These libraries provide network byte order neutrality. A message subclass is
registered with a factory so that it can be reconstituted if it arrives over the network. For rapid
prototyping and automatic marshaling support the system also provides <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__StreamMessage.htm">efd::StreamMessage</a></span>.</p>

<p>The Message System uses a <a href="../../Programmer/Categories/category_intro.htm">Category</a>
to determine how to route a message. A Category can be thought of as an address or a multicast
group. The sender of a message does not need to be aware of who the consumers are; it just
publishes a message to the appropriate Category that the rest of the application was designed to
expect. A consumer subscribes to the category of messages that it needs, and messages of that
Category are then delivered directly to the subscribing object. The application determines the
meaning of a Category and which components consume the messages that are published there.</p>

<p>Remote messages are also routed using a Category. When a remote process needs a message of a
particular Category, it uses the Message Service to perform a remote subscription. In this way,
remote processes forward matching messages from any remote producers to the local consumer.</p>

<p>When a consumer subscribes to a message, it registers for a specified C++ message subclass. The
Message System ensures that only messages of that class will be delivered to the target method for
the consuming object. To do this, the system uses the Foundation runtime type system and
easy-to-use templates.</p>

<p>Local messaging has two principal purposes. It is used to create very loose coupling between
system services. It also manages certain kinds of timing and re-entrancy problems that arise in
large, complex systems.</p>

<h2>Message Handler Considerations</h2>

<p>When developing a message handler, keep in mind that all messages are handled during the Message
System's OnTick behavior. Handlers that are heavily time consuming or inefficient will result in
degraded application performance. Emergent recommends that message handlers remain as lightweight
as possible. Care should be taken to avoid message handlers that would prevent the current frame
from completing in a timely manner.</p>

<h2>Send vs SendImmediate</h2>

<p>The Message System provides two methods for sending messages: Send and SendImmediate.</p>

<p>Messages sent using Send are processed asynchronously. Calls to Send will return immediately,
allowing the caller to continue processing. Messages sent using Send are queued by the Message
System with an optional real time delay. Messages sent with this method may or may not be delivered
during the current frame. This asynchronous behavior means that you cannot assume that an
individual message will be handled during any given frame. This is certainly to be expected when
dealing with remote messages.</p>

<p>SendImmediate will immediately deliver a given message to all of the subscribers to that
message. This happens without queueing and without delay. Subscriber message handlers are called
immediately, in the same stack context as the sender. This implies that the SendImmediate call is
blocking until all subscriber message handlers are called. SendImmediate can be thought of as a
callback mechanism using messaging. It is not supported remotely.</p>

<p>The recommended method for typical application use is asynchronous Send. This avoids tight
coupling and timing dependencies between producers and subscribers. Calls to SendImmediate should
be limited to situations where a message must absolutely be handled in the same frame as it was
sent. When using SendImmediate, care should be taken to avoid cyclic message hander / SendImmediate
calls.</p>
