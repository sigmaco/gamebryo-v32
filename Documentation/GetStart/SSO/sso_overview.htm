<h1>Online Overview</h1>

<p>Online takes Gamebryo LightSpeed into the realm of multi-platform,
multiplayer online games. It builds upon previous releases to simplify the
creation of games with an online component.</p>

<p>The Networking system extends LightSpeed's messaging system to support
multiple processes on separate machines. Each platform has specific network
libraries, called <em>NetLibs</em> for short, that plug into the NetworkService
to provide custom support for platform-specific networking features from a
single cross-platform API.</p>

</ul>

<p>The Entity Replication system simplifies the task of synchronizing entity
data between multiple processes. Using a publish-subscribe model, you can
ensure that the correct data is sent to every process that needs the data.</p>

<h2>Samples and Tutorials</h2>

<p>This release includes several examples of online technologies for use as
starting points for learning about these features. These include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="../../Tutorials/Peer_Game/sso_peer_game_intro.htm">Peer Game
    Demo and Tutorial</a>&mdash;intended to be a bare bones example of a
    working peer-to-peer game. It demonstrates functionality from the BaseGame
    demo, reimplemented to support multiple players, including support for
    rapid iteration. The accompanying tutorial walks you through all of the
    code changes required to convert Base Game into the online-enabled
    Peer Game.</li>

    <li><a href=
    "../../Tutorials/Multiplayer_Rapid/sso_multiplayer_rapid_intro.htm">Multiplayer
    Rapid Iteration Tutorial</a>&mdash;demonstrates how you can rapidly iterate
    on multiplayer games, just as you can on standalone games. This tutorial
    walks you through some examples of rapidly iterating on Peer Game with
    multiple clients connected.</li>

    <li><a href="../../Learn/SSO/sso_matchmaking_sample_intro.htm">Matchmaking
    Sample</a>&mdash;We provide NetLib implementations for all console
    platforms that include basic integration with the matchmaking services
    offered by that platform. Each of the console platforms provides slightly
    different matchmaking functionality. Platform-specific samples demonstrate
    the integration of LightSpeed networking with the matchmaking functionality
    of that platform.</li>
</ul>
