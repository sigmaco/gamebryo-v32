<p>For artists and designers, the suggested reading list is:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="../../Art/Max/Max_Plug_in_Introduction.htm">3ds max
    Plug-in</a>, <a href="../../Art/Maya/Maya_Plug_in_Introduction.htm">Maya
    Plug-in</a>, or <a href="../../Art/XSI/XSI_intro.htm">XSI Plug-in</a>
    documentation: Artists who will be creating content for use with Gamebryo
    will want to read these sections. They include samples and details on using
    the major digital content creation tools to produce scenes that maximize
    Gamebryo efficiency.</li>

    <li><a href="../../Tools/EntityModelingTool/emt_intro.htm">Entity Modeling
    Tool</a>: Designers who are creating and editing game objects should learn
    about this powerful tool.</li>

    <li><a href="../../Tools/WorldBuilder/wb_intro.htm">World Builder</a>:
    Designers or artists who are responsible for world or level layout,
    editing, and tuning should refer to this documentation.</li>

    <li><a href=
    "../../Tools/Asset_Viewer/Introduction_to_the_Asset_Viewer.htm">Asset
    Viewer</a>: Artists who want to use Gamebryo's asset previewing tool should
    consult this documentation.</li>

    <li><a href=
    "../../Tools/animation_tool/Introduction_to_Animation_Tool.htm">Animation
    Tool</a>: Artists who are interested in using Gamebryo's Animation Tool to
    set up character animation sequences should consult this
    documentation.</li>

    <li>Game Demos: Examples of both basic and advanced Gamebryo techniques:

        <ul>
            <li><a href=
            "../../Learn/MangledMetal/mm_intro.htm">MangledMetal</a>: A Game
            Framework-based demo that takes place in a world of giant
            steam-powered mechanical beings called Warjacks, from Privateer
            Press's table-top role-playing game, Warmachine&trade;. You control
            the actions of a mechanical being and are able to interact with the
            world via physical actions (using NVIDIA PhysX&trade;) and combat
            (moderated by Lua scripts). It is a full-featured, robust
            application that demonstrates many of the features and best
            practices of the Emergent Game Framework.</li>

            <li><a href=
            "../../Tutorials/Hello_World/hello_world_intro.htm">Hello
            World</a>: A tutorial that demonstrates some of the key features of
            LightSpeed's entity modeling and runtime simulation systems.</li>

            <li><a href="../../Tutorials/Base_Game/base_game_intro.htm">Base
            Game</a>: A tutorial that extends the Hello World tutorial. This
            tutorial highlights the use of PhysX triggers and Lua behavior
            scripts to add game play dynamics quickly to a basic
            application.</li>

            <li><a href=
            "../../Learn/FullDemos/MetalWars_Overview.htm">MetalWars</a>:
            MetalWars demonstrates an array of advanced shader and animation
            blending techniques. Full source and artist files are included with
            the sample, which can serve as an excellent starting point for larger
            customer titles.</li>

            <li><a href=
            "../../Learn/FullDemos/Lenguins_on_Ice_Overview.htm">Lenguins on
            Ice</a> (requires PhysX to run): This sample demonstrates PhysX by
            smashing little birds around with giant ice cubes. The
            demonstration is fully playable and also demonstrates several
            interesting Gamebryo shader techniques.</li>

            <li><a href=
            "../../Learn/FullDemos/Dodgeball_Overview.htm">DodgeBall</a>
            (requires PhysX to run): Demonstrates the use of physics rag-doll
            and blending in a light-hearted game environment. Also shows
            Gamebryo shadows.</li>
