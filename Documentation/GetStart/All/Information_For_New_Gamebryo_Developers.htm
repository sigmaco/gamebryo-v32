            Programmer Level: General Topics</a>: This section
            presents a high level overview of basic Core Runtime
            concepts such as 3D world representation, viewing,
            culling, and rendering, special effects, and NIF file
            streaming.</li>

            <li><a href=

            Animation</a>: This section discusses the powerful
            Gamebryo animation system. Gamebryo handles nearly
            every animated value that can be specified in 3ds max
            and Maya automatically upon export. In addition, it
            contains a character animation system that allows for
            blending between an arbitrary number of animation
            sequences. This documentation gives a general
            overview of the animation system along with
            lower-level descriptions of how the <span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">NiAnimation</span> library works.

            Particle Systems</a>: This documentation describes
            the extensive particle system capabilities of
            Gamebryo. Particle effects can be designed and
            created by artists in 3ds max and Maya and exported
            to NIF files to just work in the engine. Particle
            effects can also be tweaked or created
            programmatically, if desired. This documentation
            includes a high-level overview of the system as a
            whole along with descriptions of the various required
            and optional components. A full class reference for
            the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiParticle</span>

            system, including how Gamebryo handles static and
            projected multitextures, vertex lighting, and related
            items. The first few topics cover the basics of how

            the data-processing power of multi-processor
            machines. It is used heavily by the Gamebryo PS3

                used by virtually all the Core Runtime samples
                that ship with the evaluation SDK. These layers
                hide the underlying operating system, windowing
                system, and low-level Gamebryo setup. Although a
                customer may choose to use these layers, it is
                not necessary nor recommended to do so, if, for
                example, your application requires more than
                basic input handling. A simple application that
                does not use <span class=

            overview of the logging, assert, and debugging
            features available in Gamebryo LightSpeed. It
            describes how logging works and how to configure

            The Emergent Foundation, Game Framework and other
            systems rely heavily on messages to pass events
            between subsystems, entities, and system services.
            The Message System abstracts both remote and local
            messaging.</li>

            "../../Programmer/Networking/sso_networking_intro.htm">Networking</a>:
            The Networking System extends the Message System 
            so that multiple processes can communicate. This 
            allows the same messages that the Emergent Foundation,
            Game Framework and other systems use to communicate within
            the same process to communicate with remote processes as well.</li>

            <li><a href=
            "../../Programmer/AssetRuntimeService/asset_runtime_intro.htm">
            Asset Infrastructure</a>: The Asset Infrastructure
            provides a consistent framework for naming, locating,
            and organizing your assets. It is used extensively in
            LightSpeed Game Framework applications.</li>

            <li><a href=
            "../../Programmer/SystemServices/system_service_intro.htm">
            System services</a>: A system service can be any
            encapsulated module that needs to share compute
            cycles with other modules. Or, it can be an
            encapsulated module that needs to be looked up
            commonly as a singleton. The Service Manager
            initializes, ticks, and ultimately destroys each
            system service.</li>

            <li><a href=

            A model is a data-driven description of a class of
            Entity from which many entity instances are created
            and initialized. You can create a hierarchy of models
            to represent the various entities in your
            application.</li>

            <li><a href=

            Entities are game objects used to represent game
            logic during runtime. Entities are the instantiation
            of models developed in the Entity Modeling Tool
            (EMT). They have unique properties and behaviors that
            define them. Entities can be created at runtime and
            interact with one another.</li>

            <li><a href=
            "../../Programmer/Entity_Replication/sso_replication_intro.htm">Entity Replication</a>:
            Replication is an extension to the entity system that
            uses networking to communicate changes to entity
