<h1>Gamebryo LightSpeed Visual Studio Requirements</h1>

<p>Gamebryo LightSpeed ships with project files and libraries
that are built using Visual Studio. LightSpeed supports the
following versions of Microsoft Visual Studio:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Visual Studio 2005 SP1 (Visual Studio 8.0)</li>

    <li>Visual Studio 2008 SP1 (Visual Studio 9.0)</li>
</ul>

<p>The following naming conventions apply to LightSpeed project
files, libraries, and applications:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Visual Studio 2005 (Visual Studio 8.0)

        <ul>
            <li>Directory naming convention: VC80</li>

            <li>DLL naming convention:"VC80" included in
            filename</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Visual Studio 2008 (Visual Studio 9.0)

        <ul>
            <li>Directory naming convention: VC90</li>

            <li>DLL naming convention:"VC90" included in
            filename</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ul>
    <li>All LightSpeed tools, except Toolbench, default to versions built with
    Visual Studio 2005. There is no Visual Studio 2005 version of Toolbench. It defaults to Visual Studio 2008 (because it uses .NET 3.5).</li>

    <li><b>Compiler compatibility</b>&mdash;Because of the memory
    allocation schemes that LightSpeed uses, it is not safe to
    use libraries or DLLs that are built with one compiler
    version with libraries, DLLs, or applications that are built
    with a different compiler version. This applies only to code
    that actually calls LightSpeed functions.</li>

    <li><b>DLLs</b>&mdash;LightSpeed's artist tools make heavy
    use of DLLs to support its dynamic shader system and tool
    plugin system. To ensure no application accidentally loads a
    DLL that was built with the incorrect compiler version, the
    name of the compiler is integrated into the name of all
    LightSpeed DLLs (for example, note the difference in the
    following filenames NiMain32VC80D.dll and
    NiMain32VC90D.dll).</li>

    <li><b>Explicitly linked libraries</b>&mdash;In some places,
    LightSpeed searches a directory and explicitly loads all
    libraries that it finds. This is done by tools in both the
    shader system and the tool plugin system. While this provides
    enormous benefits to users, it can cause problems if the
    libraries that it finds were built with a different compiler
    version. There are two defenses against this. First, the
    directories in the LightSpeed SDK that store shader libraries
    and tool plugins are stored in "VC80" or "VC90"
    subdirectories, much like the rest of the directory tree.
    Second, all libraries that are explicitly linked in this
    manner contain exported functions that return the version of
    the compiler that was used to build the library. All code in
    the LightSpeed tools that perform this explicit linking call
    this function immediately upon linking the new library. If
    the compiler versions differ, the library is unloaded
    immediately to prevent any memory corruption.</li>
</ul>
