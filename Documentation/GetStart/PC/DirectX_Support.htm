<h1>DirectX Support</h1>

<p>The Win32 version of Gamebryo uses DirectX as its rendering 
 layer, through the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/Introduction_to_the_DX9Renderer.htm">NiDX9Renderer</a></span> 
 or <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../../Reference/NiD3D10Renderer/Introduction_to_the_D3D10Renderer.htm">NiD3D10Renderer</a></span> 
 classes. To compile the engine or any of its samples or tools, 
 the correct version of the DX SDK must be installed. To run 
 any executable that is built with the engine, the correct version of the DirectX runtimes must be installed.</p>

<p>Microsoft has made it a practice to update the DX SDK 
 four times a year. Each updated SDK version contains not only slightly 
 different header files to include and libraries to link against, but also 
 different versions of the redistributable runtime libraries. There is 
 unfortunately no installer available that will install all of these different 
 versions of the redistributable runtime libraries - only the DirectX retail 
 library installer that comes with a given version of the DX SDK will install 
 the libraries that are needed to run executables built with that version 
 of the SDK. Refer to Microsoft's DirectX documentation for more details.</p>

<p>Due to the frequent nature of the DX SDK updates, it 
 is <em>extremely important</em> to make 
 a note of the version of the SDK with which the engine was built, and 
 to ensure that all libraries and executables that are built with the engine use the same version of the DX SDK. Failure to do this may lead to compilation 
 or linking errors, or unexpected runtime behavior.</p>

<p>The current version of Gamebryo was built and tested 
 using the February 2010 DX SDK.<em> Developers 
 must use this version of the DX SDK</em> when using the libraries that 
 ship with this version of Gamebryo.</p>

<p>Gamebryo may be able to compile and run with older versions 
 of the DX SDK, but only after the entire engine has been recompiled with 
 that version of the SDK. Building Gamebryo with other versions of the DX SDK may require making changes to the Gamebryo code.</p>

<p>Gamebryo may or may not be able to compile and run with 
 a newer version of the DX SDK. In either case, Emergent Game Technologies 
 will not be able to support developers who choose to use the newer version. 
 Before even attempting this, be sure to recompile the entire engine with 
 the new SDK. </p>
