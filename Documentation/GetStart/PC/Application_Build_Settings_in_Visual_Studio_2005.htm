<h1>Application Build Settings in Visual Studio 2005</h1>

<h2>Gamebryo LightSpeed</h2>

<p>Gamebryo LightSpeed requires that the include and library
paths in Visual Studio 2005 are correctly configured in order to
compile. The directories to the current version of the DirectX
SDK must be added to the standard include and library paths
<em>before</em> the Microsoft Visual C++
directories in the include and library files lists. If they are
not listed before the default paths, then Visual Studio may find
older and incompatible versions of header or library files, which
will cause the compilation to fail. The installation process for
the DirectX SDK should cause these paths to be
set appropriately, but it is important to double check these
settings.</p>

<p>You can confirm that these paths are set by selecting
"Tools-&gt;Options..." from the menu bar, opening the folder
labeled "Projects and Solutions" and selecting the "VC++
Directories..." sub-category. From there, confirm that the
DirectX SDK paths are at the top for both the
"Include files" and "Library files" groups from the "Show
directories for" dropdown.</p>

<p>At the time of the release of this version of Gamebryo, the
February 2010 DX SDK is current.</p>

<h2>Link Settings</h2>

<p>This section covers the items configured in the project link
settings. To access this dialog, select
"Project-&gt;Properties..." from the Visual Studio menu bar, and
opening the "Configuration Properties" subtree. It is important
to note that these settings must be configured individually for
each build configuration the project uses.</p>

<p>The following libraries should be linked in with any Gamebryo
application:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">efd.lib NiMesh.lib NiFloodgate.lib
NiMain.lib NiSystem.lib</span></p>

<p>To do so, go to the project properties dialog, click the
"Linker" folder and select the "Input" sub-category. Add the five
libraries to the "Additional Dependencies" field. If the
application uses other optional Gamebryo libraries, they will
need to be added as well. The default set of libraries that
Visual Studio automatically links with do not need to be
specified.</p>

<p>To allow the linker to locate the Gamebryo libraries, open the
project properties dialog, click the "Linker" folder, and select
the "General" subcategory. The "Additional Library Directories"
field should contain the path to the Gamebryo library folder that
corresponds to your current build configuration. Each of the
project's build configurations should have a different setting
for "Additional Library Directories". The available build
configurations and their corresponding libraries are listed in
<a href="Gamebryo_Build_Configurations.htm">Gamebryo Build
Configurations</a>.</p>

<p>For example, to set the appropriate library path for a "Win32
Release" configuration, set the "Additional Library Directories"
field to "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">$(EMERGENT_PATH)\sdk\Win32\Lib\VC80\Release</span>".</p>

<h2>Linking the Game Framework</h2>

<p>In order to use the Game Framework entity and simulator
subsystems, you need to add additional link dependencies to your
project. The "Additional Dependencies" settings of applications
using the Game Framework should also include:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">efdNetwork.lib egf.lib
egfLua.lib</span></p>

<h2>Linking Core Runtime Services</h2>

<p>The Core Runtime Services depend on Game Framework libraries
as well as select Core Runtime libraries. In all cases the above
libraries listed for Game Framework must be included. Additional
Core Runtime libraries may also be required depending on the
service. See the Core Runtime Services reference documentation
for the link requirements for individual Core Runtime Services.
For example, the egmAnimation service requires the NiAnimation
library.</p>

<h2>Linking the Renderers</h2>

<p>In addition to the above build settings, the "Additional
Dependencies" setting should include the desired D3D renderer 
libraries:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9Renderer.lib
NiD3D10Renderer.lib ecrD3D11Renderer.lib</span></p>

<p>Alternatively, an application based on the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiApplication/Introduction_to_NiApplication.htm">
NiApplication</a></span> library, found in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Tools</span> directory of the shipment, may
automatically link in the renderer libraries it needs using the
pragma capabilities of Visual C++. Applications will need to define
or undefine certain preprocessor macros depending on which renderers
they want to support. Refer to the documentation on
<a href="../../Reference/NiApplication/Usage_of_NiApplication_in_Gamebryo.htm">linking 
in the renderers your application needs</a> in 
NiApplication.</p>

<h2>Linking the Miles Sound Module</h2>

<p>In addition to the above build settings, the "Additional
Dependencies" setting of applications using the Miles Sound
version of the Gamebryo <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAudio</span> library should include:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAudio.lib mss32.lib</span></p>

<p>Any application that needs to use <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAudio</span> and/or load NIF files containing
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAudio</span> based objects will
need to include and link the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAudio</span> Miles sound library. The easiest
way to add this support is to use Visual C++ pragmas in the main
source file:</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;NiAudio.h&gt;
#pragma comment(lib,"NiAudio.lib")
#pragma comment(lib,"mss32.lib")
</pre>

<h2>Linking the PhysX Modules</h2>

<p>Before you can build or link any PhysX-enabled Gamebryo
libraries or applications, you must define the environment
variable <span class="NDLSystemFont">PHYSXINSTALLPATH</span> to
point to the root of your PhysX SDK installation.</p>

<p>In addition to the above build settings, the "Additional
Dependencies" setting of applications using the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysX</span> library should include:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">efdPhysX.lib NiPhysX.lib
PhysXLoader.lib</span></p>

<p>For DLL configurations use the appropriate compiler/version
tag in the Gamebryo names, e.g. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">efdPhysX$(GB_DLL_Suffix).lib</span> <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysX$(GB_DLL_Suffix).lib</span>. The
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXFluid</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXParticle</span> libraries depend on
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysX</span>.</p>

<p>You must also add <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">$(PHYSXINSTALLPATH)\SDKs\lib\win32\</span> to the
"Additional Library Directories".</p>

<h2>Linking Other Modules</h2>

<p>The remaining core Gamebryo libraries (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAnimation</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPortal</span>, etc.) do not have dependencies
on non-Gamebryo libraries.</p>

<h2>C/C++ Settings</h2>

<p>The following sections cover the settings that need to be
configured in the project's C/C++ settings. To access this
dialog, select "Project-&gt;Settings..." from the menu bar, then
click the folder labeled "C/C++". It is important to note that
these settings will need to be set individually for each build
configuration of the project.</p>

<h3>C/C++ General</h3>

<p>For Debug build configurations, the "Debug Information Format"
setting for your project should be set to "Program Database for
Edit and Continue".</p>

<p>The "Additional Include Directories" field should list the
path of the Gamebryo include directory. This path is
"$(EMERGENT_PATH)\sdk\Win32\Include". In addition, you'll need to
include the path STLPort. This path is
"$(EMERGENT_PATH)\Source\3rdParty\STLPort\Package"</p>

<p>If using PhysX libraries, also add
$(PHYSXINSTALLPATH)\SDKs\PhysXLoader\include\,
$(PHYSXINSTALLPATH)\SDKs\Cooking\include\,
$(PHYSXINSTALLPATH)\SDKs\Physics\include\,
$(PHYSXINSTALLPATH)\SDKs\Foundation\include\, and
$(PHYSXINSTALLPATH)\SDKs\Core\include\.</p>

<p>"Detect 64-bit Portability Issues" should be set to "No".</p>

<h3>C/C++ Preprocessor Definitions</h3>

<p>In addition to the standard preprocessor definitions
associated with a Win32 application</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">WIN32, NDEBUG or _DEBUG,
_WINDOWS</span></p>

<p>Gamebryo applications must also define</p>

<!--(Table)=========================================================-->
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Configuration</th>

            <th>Defines</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>All</td>

            <td>STRICT, EE_PLATFORM_WIN32, EE_COMPILER_VC80,

            <td>EE_CONFIG_DEBUG, EE_EFD_CONFIG_DEBUG,
            NIDEBUG</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>

            <td>Release</td>

            <td>EE_CONFIG_RELEASE, EE_EFD_CONFIG_RELEASE,

        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>ReleaseDLL</td>

            <td>EE_CONFIG_RELEASE, EE_EFD_CONFIG_RELEASE,
            NIRELEASE, EE_DYNAMIC_BEHAVIOR_LOAD</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Shipping</td>

            <td>EE_CONFIG_SHIPPING, EE_EFD_CONFIG_SHIPPING,
            NISHIPPING, EE_DISABLE_LOGGING</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>ShippingDLL</td>

            <td>EE_CONFIG_SHIPPING, EE_EFD_CONFIG_SHIPPING,
            NISHIPPING, EE_DYNAMIC_BEHAVIOR_LOAD,
            EE_DISABLE_LOGGING</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Applications using PhysX must also define <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NOMINMAX</span>.</p>

<p>Whether an application is optimized or unoptimized, and
whether the application includes Debug symbols or not are options
independent of the Gamebryo library build configuration. Gamebryo
includes a "Debug with Release Libs" configuration as an example
of how to build an unoptimized application with debug symbols
that is linked with Gamebryo Release libraries. The Gamebryo
Tutorials and AssetViewer both demonstrate this build
configuration.</p>

<h3>C/C++ Code Generation and Choosing the Right Set of Runtime
Libraries</h3>

<p>The core Gamebryo engine does not require exception handling,
so it is disabled in nearly all Gamebryo project files.</p>

<p>The "Runtime library" setting depends on the build
configuration you are using. Gamebryo libraries were compiled as
follows:</p>

<!--(Table)=========================================================-->
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Build Configuration</th>

            <th>Use Runtime Library</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Debug</td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">Debug Multithreaded
            DLL</span></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Release</td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">Multithreaded
            DLL</span></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Shipping</td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">Multithreaded
            DLL</span></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>DebugDLL</td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">Debug Multithreaded
            DLL</span></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>ReleaseDLL</td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">Multithreaded
            DLL</span></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>ShippingDLL</td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">Multithreaded
            DLL</span></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The "Struct Member Alignment" field should be set to
"Default".</p>

<h3>C/C++ Language</h3>

<p>Uncheck the option "Enable Run-Time Type Information (RTTI)".
RTTI does not need to be enabled in applications that use the
Gamebryo runtime type information macros <a href=
"../../Programmer/Object_Systems/Run_Time_Type_Information.htm">NiIsExactKindOf</a>,
<a href=
"../../Programmer/Object_Systems/Run_Time_Type_Information.htm">NiIsKindOf</a>,
or <a href=
"../../Programmer/Object_Systems/Run_Time_Type_Information.htm">NiDynamicCast</a>.
These macros are independent of the Microsoft RTTI system.</p>

<h3>C/C++ Advanced</h3>

<p>The "Calling Convention" field should be set to "__cdecl".</p>

<h2>Property Sheets</h2>

<p>Gamebryo ships with a number of Property Sheets that serve as
the basis for most Gamebryo projects. These property sheets may
be found in:</p>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Build\Win32\VC80\Property
Sheets</span>.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for a Gamebryo-based application to make
use of these property sheets, but they can act as an easy way to
change the default build behavior of Gamebryo projects.</p>

<p>Because of Gamebryo's reliance on property sheets, it may
appear at first glance that Gamebryo's projects to not actually
comply with many of the settings described here. In those cases,
the setting is nearly always contained in the appropriate
property sheet, rather than in the project file itself.</p>

<h2>Visual C++ Express 2005</h2>

<p>There are a number of difficulties using Visual C++ Express
with Gamebryo. As such, only the full version of Visual Studio
2005 is supported.</p>
