<h1>Converting to Background Asset Loading</h1>

<p>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1 includes functionality that loads almost all asset classes
asynchronously using a background thread. This has a significant impact on applications because
almost every asset loading API follows a request/response model. The application requests an asset
load in some way. Later, a message is sent back to the application to indicate a successful load or
the error condition.</p>

<p>The following sections discuss the changes to asset classes since Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.0.</p>

<h2>World Files (.xblock)</h2>

<p>Continue to use the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">egf::EntityLoaderService::RequestEntitySetLoad</span> function as you did in
Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.0 to load world files. The functionality of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RequestEntitySetLoad</span> remains consistent, but the implementation has
changed.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">egf::EntityLoaderService</span> now requires the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">efd::AssetFactoryManager</span> service to load block files. Block files are loaded
using the background loader thread. Ensure that you include an instance of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">efd::AssetFactoryManager</span> in your application, either by explicitly
instantiating and adding an instance to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">efd::ServiceManager</span>,
or by taking advantage of the instance that is created by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">efd::ServiceAllocator</span>.</p>

<p>You can continue to detect when a block file load completes by subscribing to a category and
passing this category in the call to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">egf::EntityLoaderService::RequestEntitySetLoad</span>. For more details, see
<a href="../../Programmer/Game_Initialization/game_init_load_assets.htm">Game Initialization: About
loading assets</a>.</p>

<p>World load operations also load dependent flat model files and Lua behavior scripts.</p>

<h2>Flat Models (.flat)</h2>

<p>When an <span class="NDLSystemFont">efd::AssetFactoryManager</span> service is present, the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">egf::FlatModelManager</span> no longer precaches flat model file
locations. The FlatModelManager waits for the AssetFactoryManager to complete initialization before
completing its own initialization. It then uses the AssetFactoryManager to load requested flat
model files using the background loader thread.</p>

<p>There are implications to not caching flat model file locations when creating entities
dynamically or looking up flat model properties at runtime. If the flat model used in these
operations was not previously loaded, either as part of another load request or explicitly
preloaded, these operations will fail to find the flat model.</p>

<p>Flat model files will automatically be loaded when loading world files and when creating new
entities dynamically at runtime (see below). For world file loads, all flat models and Lua behavior
scripts that are required for all entities in the block file are automatically loaded. For
dynamically created entities using the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">egf::EntityManager::CreateEntity</span> or <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">BehaviorAPI::CreateEntity</span> / <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateEntityAndWait</span> functions, flat models and Lua scripts are loaded
automatically. Dependent flat models are added to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">egf::FlatModelManager</span> by the requesting service. Lua behavior scripts are
added to the Lua runtime system by SchedulerLua.</p>

<p>If you require access to flat models that are not associated with a loaded block file or
previously created dynamic entity, you must use the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">egf::FlatModelManager::PreloadModel</span> function to preload these files. This
ensures that the flat model and all of its dependencies are loaded. The PreloadModel function
allows you to specify a callback category that is notified once the model preload operation
completes.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">egf::FlatModelManager::FindOrLoadModel</span> function should
not be used for this purpose and has been deprecated. This method relies on pre-locating all flat
model files during initialization to load flat models at runtime. When an AssetFactoryManager
service is present, use of <span class="NDLSystemFont">FindOrLoadModel</span> may fail for flat
models not previously loaded.</p>

<p>If your application relies on the <span class="NDLSystemFont">FindOrLoadModel</span> function,
Emergent recommends that you switch to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">egf::FlatModelManager::PreloadModel</span>. If this is not feasible, you can
precache all of the flat models as before by performing an asset locate operation on
"urn:emergent-flat-model" and load each located flat model asset using <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">egf::FlatModelManager::LoadModelFile</span>. Be aware that neither <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FindOrLoadModel</span> nor <span class="NDLSystemFont">LoadModelFile</span>
calculate mix in or Lua behavior script dependencies. You will have to explicitly preload these
dependencies appropriately.</p>

<h2>Entities</h2>

<p>This section describes changes to the entity loading process.</p>

<h3>Asynchronous entity creation</h3>

<p>Asynchronous entity creation is now fully supported.</p>

<p>Entities found in world files are automatically created when the world is loaded.</p>

<p>To asynchronously create entities at runtime, use the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">egf::EntityManager::CreateEntity</span> method from C++, or the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">BehaviorAPI::CreateEntity</span> or <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">BehaviorAPI::CreateEntityAndWait</span> functions from script. These functions use
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">efd::AssetFactoryManager</span> to load the Entity's flat model and
Lua behavior scripts in a background thread. Using these methods ensures all preloadable assets are
loaded and that the Entity OnCreate life cycle behavior is called for the newly created entity.</p>

<h4>Reducing delays when creating entities asynchronously</h4>

<p>Asynchronous entity creation ensures any disk I/O needed to create the entity happens in a
background thread and not in the main application thread. For time critical or frequently created
entities the delays introduced by asynchronous creation may not be acceptable. You can reduce this
delay considerably by implementing the following steps.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Precache necessary assets.

        <p class="indent1">If your entity relies on particular assets, precache these assets prior
        to creating the entity. The various system services that load assets support the preloading
        / precaching of these assets. For example, you can use the <span class=
        "NDLSystemFont">egmAnimation::AnimationService::cache</span> function to tell the Animation
        Service to cache a particular animation file. In particular, precache animations, scene
        graph files, and flat model files.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Turn off <span class="NDLSystemFont">AssetPreload</span> in your Entity flat model.

        <p class="indent1">The <span class="NDLSystemFont">AssetPreload</span> flag associated with
        the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Preloadable</span> standard model library model tells the
        entity creation system to preload any assets asynchronously. This can introduce a delay of
        several frames as the assets are preloaded. This delay is present even if you precache all
        of the Entity's assets. You can eliminate this delay by disabling <span class=
        "NDLSystemFont">AssetPreload</span> in your Entity flat model.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Avoid using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnCreate</span> and <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">OnAssetsLoaded</span> script behaviors.

        <p class="indent1">The Entity lifecycle <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnCreate</span> and
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnAssetsLoaded</span> script behaviors are called during the
        entity creation process. The runtime system requires at least one frame to invoke these
        behaviors. If you can avoid implementing these functions you can eliminate this delay.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Synchronous entity instantiation</h3>

<p>Creating entities asynchronously minimizes the runtime performance cost of creating entities.
There are times, however, when the non-deterministic nature of asynchronous entity creation is
undesirable. It's not possible to guarantee an entity is fully created because dependent assets may
still load asynchronously. However, there are steps you can take to make the process more
deterministic.</p>

<p>First, preload flat models used by dynamically created entities using <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">egf::FlatModelManager::PreloadModel</span>. This makes the flat model and all of
its flat model and Lua behavior script dependencies available at runtime. Ideally, do this during
initialization.</p>

<p>To instantiate your new entity, use the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">egf::FlatModelManager::FactoryEntity</span> family of functions. This will return
an EntityPtr instance. Pass this instance to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">egf::EntityManager::AddEntity</span> to make it available to the rest of the
application. Your new entity may still not be available for behavior invocation; especially if it
needs to load dependent assets.</p>

<h3>Asynchronous creation versus Synchronous entity instantiation</h3>

<p>Here are some things to consider when deciding between asynchronous entity creation and
synchronous entity instantiation.</p>

<h4>Asynchronous Entity Creation</h4>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Advantages</th>

            <th>Disadvantages</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td width="50%">Dependent flat model and Lua behavior files are loaded
            automatically.</td>

            <td>Creation will take several frames to complete unless you precache assets
            manually.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>File I/O happens in the background thread.</td>

            <td></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Minimal performance impact at runtime.</td>

            <td></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>When notified that creation is complete, the entity ready to execute
            behaviors.</td>

            <td></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Available from C++ and from scripts.</td>

            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Use asynchronous entity creation when creating entities where timing is not critical. If a
several tick delay in the creation of the entity will not affect application performance or
behavior, asynchronous creation is recommended.</p>

<h4>Synchronous Entity Instantiation</h4>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Advantages</th>

            <th>Disadvantages</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td width="50%">Instantiated entity objects are available immediately.</td>

            <td>You must remember to preload flat models required by each entity.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td></td>

            <td>You must remember to add the factoried entity to the EntityManager.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td></td>

            <td>It still may be several ticks before the entity is fully created and ready to
            execute behaviors.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td></td>

            <td>Not available from scripts.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Synchronous instantiation guarantees that an EntityPtr is available for setting properties; it
does not, however, guarantee the entity is fully created and ready for simulation. If the
instantiated entity has other dependent assets, these will be loaded asynchronously which may take
several additional ticks. Proper preloading of entity flat model files is required to instantiate
entities synchronously at runtime.</p>

<p>See <a href="../../Programmer/Entities/entity_creating.htm">Creating entities</a> for more
details.</p>

<h2>Scripts (.lua)</h2>

<p>In Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.0 <span class="NDLSystemFont">egf::SchedulerLua</span> located all
known Lua script files and added the fully qualified path to each file to the package.path Lua
global variable. The Lua runtime would search this path for Lua scripts when processing 'require'
or 'dofile' operations. This had two negative side effects.</p>

<p>The time it took the Lua runtime to find and load a given Lua script was proportional to the
number of paths appended to package.path. If you had Lua scripts in multiple locations, it could
take the Lua runtime an unexpected length of time to load it. This search was synchronous in the
main thread, affecting performance.</p>

<p>SchedulerLua appended the path to all Lua scripts in an asset web to the package.path. This
meant if you had multiple scripts with the same name in your asset web, only the first script found
was loaded. This could lead to incorrect or unexpected runtime behavior.</p>

<p>In LightSpeed 3.1 all Lua behavior scripts, and their dependencies, are automatically loaded and
added to the Lua runtime system when loading World and Flat Model files using the
AssetFactoryManager. SchedulerLua no longer appends Lua script paths to the Lua package.path global
variable. Instead, each Lua script is loaded explicitly into the Lua runtime.</p>

<p>If you have Lua scripts that are not Lua Behaviors, you must explicitly preload these scripts
into the Lua runtime using <span class="NDLSystemFont">SchedulerLua::PreloadModule</span>. The
PreloadModule function asynchronously loads the script and all of its dependencies into the
runtime. You can provide a callback category to receive notification when a preload completes.</p>

<p>If you application relies on Lua scripts that are not part of your asset web, consider adding
them. If this is not desirable, ensure the Lua runtime package.path is set appropriately to locate
your scripts at runtime. Do note these scripts will continue to use the main thread to load from
disk.</p>

<p>Asynchronous loading of Lua scripts assumes you will only have one script with a given name in
your asset web. If you have multiple scripts with the same name, the Lua background loader will
assert. If each script provides the same functionality, consider moving them to a common location.
Otherwise, rename one script to prevent name collisions at runtime.</p>

<h2>Scene Graphs (.nif)</h2>

<p>All Gamebryo Scene Graphs loaded by the <a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_scene_graph_svc.htm">Scene Graph Service</a> are
asynchronously background loaded. Services wishing to load nif files synchronously must do so
explicitly. See the <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_tool_scene_svc.htm">Tool
Scene Service</a> for an example (Gizmo files are loaded directly).</p>

<p>Regardless of the method used to initiate a scene graph load, an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/ecr/ecr__SceneGraphAddedMessage.htm">ecr::SceneGraphAddedMessage</a></span>
message will be sent when a scene graph has been loaded and is ready for use. This is the message
that applications or custom services should register for when they need notification that a scene
graph is ready. Note that entities with the Preload model will have their scene graphs loaded
before the entity notifications are sent out, and in such cases it is sufficient to wait only on
the entire entity.</p>

<p>The following specific functions lead to scene graph loading and are now potentially
asynchronous. See the <a href="../../Reference/ecr/ecr__SceneGraphService.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ecr::SceneGraphService</span> class reference documentation</a> for the details of
return values and messages. Note that some functions will return success immediately if the scene
graph is cached and does not need to be loaded from media.</p>

            using <span class="NDLSystemFont">ecr::SceneGraphService::GetSceneGraphCache</span>.
            The handles are also necessary to uncache objects, so must be stored by the application
            if uncaching of specific assets is required. There remains a function to uncache all
            objects, regardless of handle.</td>

<h2>Animation (.kfm, .kf)</h2>

<p>All Gamebryo Animation files loaded by the <a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_animation_svc.htm">Animation Service</a> are
asynchronously background loaded.</p>

<p>Regardless of the method used to initiate an actor load, an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/egmAnimation/egmAnimation__ActorAddedMessage.htm">egmAnimation::ActorAddedMessage</a></span>
message will be sent when an actor has been loaded and is ready for use. This is the message that
applications or custom services should register for when they need notification that an actor is
ready. Note that entities with the Preload model will have their actors loaded before the entity
notifications are sent out, and in such cases it is sufficient to wait only on the entire
entity.</p>

<p>There is no way to manually create an actor with the service, except through caching. The
following cache functions are now asynchronous. See the <a href=
"../../Reference/egmAnimation/egmAnimation__AnimationService.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">egmAnimation::AnimationService</span> class reference documentation</a> for the
details of return values and messages.</p>

</table>

<h2>Custom Shaders</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderService</span> parses and loads every shader located in
the asset web associated with the shader libraries used by the application. In Gamebryo 3.0, all of
this would occur over a few <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderService::OnInit</span> calls. This
could result in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderService</span> spending anywhere from
hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds (depending on the number of shaders in the assetweb) in a
single <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> call.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderService</span> has been updated to allow an upper bound to
be placed on the amount of time that can be spent in a single <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderService::OnInit</span> call. After parsing or loading a shader in OnInit the
shader service will see if it has spent more than its allotted amount of time in OnInit. If so, it
will return <span class="NDLSystemFont">AsyncResults_Pending</span>, so that other services have a
chance to tick. This allows for other services to do additional work, such as rendering a loading
screen, while shaders are being loaded by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderService</span>.</p>

<p>By default the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderService</span> is set to spend a maximum of 10
milliseconds in <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span>. This value can be changed by calling
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderService::SetMaxOnInitTime</span>. Keep in mind that since the
time spent in <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderService::OnInit</span> is evaluated once per shader
it is possible for more than the maximum allotted amount of time to be spent in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderService::OnInit</span>, depending on how much time it takes to load a single
shader.</p>

<p>As one might expect uncompiled custom shaders take significantly longer to load than
pre-compiled shaders. To aid with loading speed shipping titles should always use pre-compiled
custom shaders.</p>

<h2>Action Maps (.actionmap)</h2>

<p>The loading of action maps is now asynchronous. The load will be initiated with a call to the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/ecrInput/ecrInput__InputService.htm">ecrInput::InputService::LoadAllActionMaps</a></span>
member function. Note that, despite the name, only one action map can be loaded at a time. When the
load is complete, a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/ecrInput/ecrInput__InputActionMapsLoaded.htm">ecrInput::InputActionMapsLoaded</a></span>
message is sent on a category that may be queried from the service. The message is send even on
failure.
