<h1>NiAnimation Conversion</h1>

<p>Sequence-based animation in the NiAnimation library has been refactored for
Gamebryo 2.6. Refer to the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/Introduction_to_Animation.htm">Introduction to
Animation</a> for an overview of the revised Gamebryo animation system
including typical usage patterns for sequence-based animation. The animation
enhancements focus on six main areas:</p>

<p>1. The separation of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerSequence.htm">NiControllerSequence</a></span>
into two classes to reduce the memory footprint when sequences are shared by
multiple characters. This division of labor affects a number of supported
functions with the majority of these previously residing in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm">NiControllerManager</a></span>,
and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm">NiActorManager</a></span>.
<a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Sequence_Recycling">Sequence
recycling</a> is enabled by default to improve runtime performance and minimize
memory fragmentation.</p>

<p>2. Improving the runtime performance of sequence-based animation. Sequence
animation now utilizes <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiEvaluator.htm">NiEvaluator</a></span> objects
instead of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiInterpolator.htm">NiInterpolator</a></span>
objects to compute the animated data for a given time. Each active sequence
(i.e. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>) owns an
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiScratchPad.htm">NiScratchPad</a></span> which
stores any instance-based data required by the evaluators to play the sequence
on the character. Many evaluators cache their current animation curve segment
in the scratch pad which allows them to reuse this localized data across
successive update times thereby increasing runtime performance.</p>

<p>3. The consolidation of the interpolator/controller network that transmits
data from active animation sequences to associated scene graph targets. The new
pose buffer system replaces this large network of narrow data pipes with a
smaller system of wide data pipes with the prospect of improved parallel
computation down the road.</p>

<p>4. Increasing the role of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_updating">NiControllerManager::Update</a></span>
such that it now propagates the character's latest animation state to the scene
graph. Previously, this operation was delayed until a future scene graph
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm#UpdateFunctions">Update</a></span> call.
This modification alters the timing as to when scene graph attributes,
including local transform values, are updated by the sequence animation system.
Centralizing this responsibility in the controller manager provides greater
opportunity for parallel computation in the future.</p>

<p>5. Extensions to the animation callback systems to support the separation of
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> into two classes. This
topic is given special treatment here as it involves a new event type and usage
pattern when applications hold onto active sequences.</p>

<p>6. Improving the robustness and usability of the accumulation root and
<a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Transformation_Accumulation">
accumulation transform</a>.</p>

<p>The following sections provide more details about what has changed in the
NiAnimation library and how to convert existing Gamebryo 2.5 applications to
work with Gamebryo 2.6. The <a href="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiAnimation_Rel_Notes.htm">Release Notes for
the NiAnimation library</a> should also be consulted as it contains a number of

<h2>Separation of NiControllerSequence into two classes</h2>

<p>The storage and playback of sequence animation has been refactored in
Gamebryo 2.6 to reduce the memory footprint when sequences are shared by
multiple characters. Gamebryo 2.6 utilizes two classes to represent animated
sequences: <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm">NiSequenceData</a></span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerSequence.htm">NiControllerSequence</a></span>.
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects contain the
shareable, heavyweight data of exported animation sequences saved in KF files.
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects are temporary
runtime entities created upon sequence activation. These lighter weight objects
maintain instance-based state to play back the animated sequence on a
particular character, and are destroyed or recycled shortly after the active
sequence runs to completion. <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Sequence_Recycling">Sequence
recycling</a> is enabled by default to improve runtime performance and minimize
memory fragmentation.</p>

<p>Older versions of Gamebryo utilized a single class, also named <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>, which performed the composite
duties of the new <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> classes. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects stored in KF files from
Gamebryo 1.2 to 2.5 are automatically converted by Gamebryo 2.6 to the new
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> format during the loading
process.</p>

<p>The following items describe changes to supported functions in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm">NiControllerManager</a></span>,
and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm">NiActorManager</a></span> to
account for the fact that sequences are now stored in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects as opposed to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects. To convert your
application to Gamebryo 2.6 modify your code to work with the new <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> classes based on the context in
which each sequence object is used.</p>

<h3>NiControllerSequence functionality</h3>

<p>The following are modifications to the previously supported <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> interface.</p>

<p>- Renamed the <span class="NDLSystemFont">AnimState</span> enumeration to
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerSequence.htm#NiAnimState">NiAnimState</a></span>
and moved it to a separate include file, NiAnimState.h, to reduce circular
include dependencies.</p>

<p>- Renamed the static <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateSequenceFromFile</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateAllSequencesFromFile</span> functions to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateSequenceDataFromFile</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateAllSequenceDatasFromFile</span>. Moved these functions to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>. Data types of communicated
values were changed from <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>.</p>

<p>- Moved the supported constructor to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> so a shareable animation sequence can be
built programmatically. Eliminated support for a constructor in the new
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> class. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects are temporary runtime
objects representing active sequences. These should always be created via
supported functions, such as <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ActivateSequence</span> in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span>.</p>

<p>- Moved <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetName</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetName</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence::GetName</span> returns the name of its
source <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>.</p>

<p>- Moved <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetTextKeys</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects reference the text key list
of their source <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> upon
activation. Both <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> support <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetTextKeys</span>.</p>

<p>- Maintained <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetKeyTimeAt</span> in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> as well as <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>. These return identical values
since they operate on the same text key list.</p>

<p>- Deprecated and removed the underutilized <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetKeyTimeAtDivFreq</span> convenience function. This can be
replaced by <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetKeyTimeAt</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">TimeDivFreq</span>.</p>

<p>- Maintained <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetCycleType</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SetCycleType</span> in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> as well as <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> cycle type acts as the default cycle type
upon sequence activation. However, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence::SetCycleType</span> can be used to
override this default value on an instance by instance basis.</p>

<p>- Moved <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetFrequency</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> frequency acts as the default frequency
upon sequence activation. However, most sequence activation and transition
functions have a frequency parameter which allows this default frequency to be
overridden on an instance by instance basis.</p>

<p>- Maintained <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetFrequency</span> in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> as well as <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData::GetFrequency</span> returns the default
frequency at which the sequence will be activated in the future. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence::GetFrequency</span> returns the actual
frequency of the active sequence.</p>

<p>- Maintained <span class="NDLSystemFont">TimeDivFreq</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">TimeMultFreq</span> in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> as well as <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>. These operate using the frequency
of the respective object.</p>

<p>- Deprecated and removed <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetBeginKeyTime</span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SetBeginKeyTime</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetBeginKeyTimeDivFreq</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetEndKeyTime</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetEndKeyTime</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetEndKeyTimeDivFreq</span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetLength</span>. The local timeline of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> has been redefined such that it
always begins at time 0.0 and ends at time <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetDuration</span>. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetDuration</span> is equivalent to the deprecated <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetLength</span> as it returns the duration of the animation in
seconds. Both <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> support <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetDuration</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetDurationDivFreq</span>. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> supports <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetDuration</span> for use by tools and other code which
programmatically generate <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>
objects. <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetDuration</span> should not be used to
adjust the timing of sequences during runtime playback. Code utilizing
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SetDuration</span> must ensure the times of
evaluator keys range from 0.0 to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetDuration</span>.</p>

<p>- Deprecated and removed <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetControllerAt</span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">GetTargetAt</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetBlendInterpolatorAt</span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetBlendIdxAt</span>. These functions became obsolete with the
new pose buffer system which <a href=
"NiAnimation_Conversion.htm#Consolidation_of_the_interpolator_controller_network">
consolidates the interpolator/controller network</a>.</p>

<p>- Kept the following functions in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> since these deal with runtime
playback concepts: <span class="NDLSystemFont">ResetSequence</span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">GetState</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetOffset</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetOffset</span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">GetTimeAt</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetLastTime</span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetLastScaledTime</span>.</p>

<p>- Renamed <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetSequenceWeight</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SetSequenceWeight</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetWeight</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetWeight</span>. These runtime playback functions were kept in
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>. Most sequence
activation and transition functions have weight parameters which assign a
maximum <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Weights">weight</a> to
active sequences. <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetWeight</span> may be used at a
later time to adjust this initial setting.</p>

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetPriority</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> to obtain the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Priorities">priority</a>
of the active sequence. Priority is always set via the sequence activation and
transition functions.</p>

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetActivationID</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> to differentiate between different
instances of a recycled sequence. Successive activations of the same sequence
will have different IDs, even when sequence recycling is enabled.</p>

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetSequenceData</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> to access the source <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> from which the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> was activated.</p>

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetTimeSyncSequence</span> to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> to access the
associated time sync sequence, if present.</p>

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetPoseBuffer</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> to access the associated
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiPoseBuffer.htm">NiPoseBuffer</a></span>. Each
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> owns an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBuffer</span> to which the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> writes its animated data during
each <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> call. Effectively, this pose
buffer contains a time-based snapshot (or pose) of the animated sequence.</p>

<p>- Sequences now rely upon evaluators instead of interpolators to compute
animated data at a given time. See this <a href=
"NiAnimation_Conversion.htm#Improving_runtime_performance_via_sequence_evaluators">
section</a> for information on how this transition affects the supported
interface.</p>

<h3>NiControllerManager functionality</h3>

<p>The following are modifications to the previously supported <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> interface.</p>

<p>- Renamed <span class="NDLSystemFont">AddSequenceFromFile</span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">AddAllSequencesFromFile</span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AddSequence</span> to <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_adding_sequences">
AddSequenceDataFromFile</a></span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_adding_sequences">
AddAllSequenceDatasFromFile</a></span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_adding_sequences">
AddSequenceData</a></span> respectively. Data types of communicated values were
changed from <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>. The optional <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">kName</span> parameter was dropped from these methods. If the
sequence name requires modification, applications should use <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData::SetName</span> to rename the sequence before
adding it to a controller manager.</p>

<p>- Renamed <span class="NDLSystemFont">RemoveSequence</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_removing_sequences">
RemoveSequenceData</a></span>. Data types of communicated values were changed
from <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>.</p>

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_removing_sequences">
RemoveAllSequenceDatas</a></span> which removes all the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects from a character.</p>

<p>- Modified the behavior of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_removing_actively_playing_sequences">
RemoveAllSequences</a></span> such that it now operates exclusively on
temporary <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects (i.e.
active sequences). Depending on the context of how your application used this
function, you might need to rename it to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RemoveAllSequenceDatas</span>.</p>

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_removing_actively_playing_sequences">
RemoveAllInactiveSequences</a></span> which removes temporary <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects that have run to
completion.</p>

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_retrieving_sequences">
GetSequenceDataCount</a></span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_retrieving_sequences">
GetSequenceDataByName</a></span>, and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_retrieving_sequences">
GetSequenceDataAt</a></span> which operate on <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects.</p>

<p>- Modified the behavior of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_retrieving_actively_playing_sequences">
GetSequenceCount</a></span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_retrieving_actively_playing_sequences">
GetSequenceByName</a></span>, and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_retrieving_actively_playing_sequences">
GetSequenceAt</a></span> such that these now operate exclusively on temporary
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects (i.e. active
sequences). Depending on the context of how your application used these
functions, you might need to rename these to match the new <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> related functions of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetSequenceDataCount</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetSequenceDataByName</span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetSequenceDataAt</span>.</p>

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_retrieving_actively_playing_sequences">
GetSequenceBySequenceData</a></span> which returns an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> based on a specified source
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>.</p>

<p>- Modified <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_activating_sequences">
ActivateSequence</a></span> to deal with <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> parameters instead of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>. Parameters were added to set the
frequency (i.e. playback speed) as well as the starting frame. Note the default
frequency for a sequence can be set via <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData::SetFrequency</span>. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">bStartOver</span> parameter has been removed since <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ActivateSequence</span> always creates a new <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> object representing the newly
activated sequence. If your application relied upon <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">bStartOver</span> to restart a previously active sequence from
the beginning, you'll need to call <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_deactivating_sequences">
DeactivateSequence</a></span> on the active <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> before calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ActivateSequence</span>. Here's some sample code:</p><a name=
"Sample_code_for_bStartOver" id="Sample_code_for_bStartOver"></a>
<pre>
// Deactivate an active sequence in preparation for restarting it from the beginning.
NiControllerSequence* pkActiveSequence = pkManager-&gt;GetSequenceBySequenceData(pkSeqData);
if (pkActiveSequence)
{
    pkManager-&gt;DeactivateSequence(pkActiveSequence);
}
NiControllerSequencePtr spNewActiveSequence = pkManager-&gt;ActivateSequence(pkSeqData);
</pre>

<p>Upon success, <span class="NDLSystemFont">ActivateSequence</span> returns a
pointer to the newly created <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> which represents the newly
activated sequence. If your application needs to hang onto this <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>, refer to the <a href=
"NiAnimation_Conversion.htm#Extensions_to_the_animation_callback_systems">Animation
Callback section</a> in this Conversion Guide for the recommended usage
pattern.</p>

<p>- Modified the parameters in the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_cross_fading_two_sequences">
CrossFade</a></span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_blend_transitions">
BlendFromSequence</a></span>, and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_morph_transitions">
Morph</a></span> transition functions to reflect the fact the source is always
an active <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> and the
destination an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>. A parameter
was added to specify the frequency (i.e. playback speed) of the destination
sequence. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">bStartOver</span> parameter has been
removed from <span class="NDLSystemFont">CrossFade</span> since a new
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> is created to represent
the newly activated destination sequence. See <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ActivateSequence</span> above for <a href=
"NiAnimation_Conversion.htm#Sample_code_for_bStartOver">sample code</a> which
mimics the prior <span class="NDLSystemFont">bStartOver</span> behavior. Upon
success, these transition functions return a pointer to the newly created
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> which represents the
newly activated destination sequence. See the <a href=
"NiAnimation_Conversion.htm#Extensions_to_the_animation_callback_systems">Animation
Callback section</a> in this Conversion Guide for the recommended usage pattern
if your application needs to hang onto this <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> object.</p>

<p>- Added support for the previously deprecated <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Alternate_functions_for_blend_transitions">
BlendFromPose</a></span>. This modified version operates on <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects and initiates a blend transition
from the character's current scene graph state to a destination <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">pkSeqDataToSynchronize</span> parameter is now required as it
dictates which scene graph attributes are captured in the new pose sequence.
The newly created <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>
objects for the pose sequence and destination sequence are returned via the

Callback section</a> in this Conversion Guide for the recommended usage pattern
if your application needs to hang onto these <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">BlendFromPose</span> is less efficient than <span class=

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_adding_sequences">
AddPoseSequenceData</a></span> primarily as a helper function for <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">BlendFromPose</span>; however, this may prove useful in other

<p>- Removed the previously deprecated <span class="NDLSystemFont">Sum</span>
function. Applications using <span class="NDLSystemFont">Sum</span> should call
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ActivateSequence</span> on both sequences using
appropriate weight values.</p>

<p>- Removed the previously deprecated <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetSumWeight</span> function. Applications using <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetSumWeight</span> should call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_setting_sequence_weight">
SetSequenceWeight</a></span> on both sequences using appropriate weight
values.</p>

<p>- Removed the previously deprecated <span class=

"NDLSystemFont">StopSum</span> should call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">DeactivateSequence</span> on both sequences.</p>

<p>- Removed the previously deprecated <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">StopBlendFromPose</span> function. Applications using
<span class="NDLSystemFont">StopBlendFromPose</span> should switch to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">StopBlendFromSequence</span>.</p>

<h3>NiActorManager functionality</h3>

<p>The following are modifications to the previously supported <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> interface.</p>

<p>- Modified the behavior of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm#Constructors">Create</a></span>
such that it adds <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm">NiSequenceData</a></span>
objects instead of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerSequence.htm">NiControllerSequence</a></span>
objects to the underlying <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm">NiControllerManager</a></span>.</p>

<p>- Renamed <span class="NDLSystemFont">LoadSequence</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LoadSequences</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ChangeSequence</span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UnloadSequence</span> to <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_load_sequences">LoadSequenceData</a></span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_load_sequences">LoadAllSequenceData</a></span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_load_sequences">ChangeSequenceData</a></span>,
and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_unload_sequences">UnloadSequenceData</a></span>
respectively. Data types of parameters were changed from <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>.</p>

<p>- Renamed <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetSequence</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_retrieve_sequences">
GetSequenceData</a></span>. This function now returns an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> instead of an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>.</p>

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_retrieve_sequences">
GetActiveSequence</a></span> which returns the first active <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> assigned to a specific sequence
ID.</p>

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_retrieve_sequences">
GetSequenceID</a></span> as a helper function to obtain the sequence ID of a
specified <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>.</p>

<p>- Modified <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_activate_sequences">
ActivateSequence</a></span> so it operates on <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects behind the scenes. Parameters
were added to set the frequency (i.e. playback speed) as well as the starting
frame. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">bStartOver</span> parameter has been
removed since <span class="NDLSystemFont">ActivateSequence</span> always
creates a new <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> object
representing the newly activated sequence. If your application relied upon
<span class="NDLSystemFont">bStartOver</span> to restart a previously active
sequence from the beginning, you'll need to call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_deactivate_sequences">
DeactivateSequence</a></span> before calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ActivateSequence</span>. Upon success, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ActivateSequence</span> returns a pointer to the newly created
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> which represents the
newly activated sequence. If your application needs to hang onto this
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>, refer to the <a href=

<h2>Improving runtime performance via sequence evaluators</h2>

<p>The runtime performance of sequence-based animation has been improved
through the use of an evaluator/scratch pad design. Sequence animation now
utilizes <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiEvaluator.htm">NiEvaluator</a></span> objects
instead of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiInterpolator.htm">NiInterpolator</a></span>
objects to compute the animated data for a given time. Unlike interpolators,
evaluators are completely shareable as they contain no instance-based state for
playing animations on a specific character. Each active sequence (i.e.
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerSequence.htm">NiControllerSequence</a></span>)
owns an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiScratchPad.htm">NiScratchPad</a></span> which
stores any instance-based data required by the evaluators to play the sequence
on the character. Many evaluators cache their current animation curve segment
in the scratch pad which allows them to reuse this localized data across
successive update times thereby increasing runtime performance. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiInterpolator</span> and its derived classes are still
available for non-sequence based animation.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/Animation_Sequences.htm">Animation Sequences</a>
section in the Introduction to Animation for an overview of the revised
sequence animation system.</p>

<h3>NiControllerSequence functionality</h3>

<p>The following are modifications to the previously supported <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> interface.</p>

<p>- Moved virtually all of the interpolator related functions to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm">NiSequenceData</a></span> so a
shareable animation sequence can be built programmatically. These methods now
act upon <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiEvaluator.htm">NiEvaluator</a></span> objects,
and include <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm#Functions_for_adding_and_removing_evaluators">
AddEvaluator</a></span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm#Functions_for_adding_and_removing_evaluators">
RemoveEvaluator</a></span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm#Functions_for_adding_and_removing_evaluators">
GetMaxEvaluators</a></span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm#Functions_for_adding_and_removing_evaluators">
SetMaxEvaluators</a></span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm#Functions_for_retrieving_evaluators">
GetNumEvaluators</a></span>, and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm#Functions_for_retrieving_evaluators">
GetEvaluatorAt</a></span>. Since evaluators do not contain any instance data
the evaluator list in <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> is
shared directly by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>
upon sequence activation. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> supports <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerSequence.htm#Functions_dealing_with_evaluators">
GetNumEvaluators</a></span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerSequence.htm#Functions_dealing_with_evaluators">
GetEvaluatorAt</a></span> for accessing the evaluator list.</p>

<p>- The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> constructor now
specifies the initial size for the evaluator list in lieu of the interpolator
list. The evaluator list is kept packed so the first <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetNumEvaluators</span> evaluators in this list will always be
valid (i.e. not <span class="NDLSystemFont">NULL</span>).</p>

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm#Functions_for_sorting_evaluators">
SortEvaluatorsByLOD</a></span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm#Functions_for_sorting_evaluators">
SortEvaluatorsByPBChannelType</a></span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>. These functions may be used by animation
tools, such as the <a href=
"../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Controller_Extractor.htm">Controller Extractor
export plug-in</a>, to sort the evaluators within a sequence.</p>

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerSequence.htm#Functions_dealing_with_evaluators">
DisableEvaluatorAt</a></span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerSequence.htm#Functions_dealing_with_evaluators">
DisableEvaluatorChannelAt</a></span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> so evaluator channels in an active
sequence may be disabled. Once disabled the evaluator no longer outputs data
from the disabled channels to the associated pose buffer.</p>

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetScratchPad</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> to access the associated
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiScratchPad.htm">NiScratchPad</a></span>. Each
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> owns an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiScratchPad</span> which stores any instance-based state
required by the evaluators to play the animation on the character. In general,
applications can ignore the scratch pad as it is used internally by the
animation system.</p>

<p>- Removed the previously deprecated functions of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetObjectNameAt</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AddNameControllerPair</span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RemoveNameControllerPair</span>. New code should use
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData::AddEvaluator</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">RemoveEvaluator</span> instead.</p>

<p>- <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiEvaluator</span> directly stores its
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiEvaluator.htm#IDTag">IDTag</a></span> which
specifies the corresponding animated scene graph attribute. Previously,
interpolator tags were externalized and held by <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiEvaluator</span> interface provides access to its tag
information.</p>

<h3>Interpolator and controller functionality</h3>

<p>The following modifications affect the internals of the Gamebryo sequence
animation system and do not impact the high level interface of sequence
animation. No conversion is necessary for these changes unless your application
implemented custom interpolators and interp controllers for sequence-based
animation.</p>

<p>- The new <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiEvaluator.htm">NiEvaluator</a></span> class
hierarchy mirrors the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiInterpolator.htm">NiInterpolator</a></span>
hierarchy to a large degree with the exception of blend evaluators which are
not required due to the use of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiPoseBlender.htm">NiPoseBlender</a></span>.
Additionally, several const evaluators have been added to reduce the size of
sequences.</p>

<p>- Added <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiInterpolatorConverter.htm">NiInterpolatorConverter</a></span>
which converts a specified <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiInterpolator</span> to
an equivalent <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiEvaluator</span>. Equivalency is
determined by the contents of the animation channel and not necessarily the
<a href=
"../../Programmer/Object_Systems/Run_Time_Type_Information.htm">RTTI</a> of the
specified interpolator. For instance, an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiFloatInterpolator.htm">NiFloatInterpolator</a></span>
containing posed animation data will be converted to an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiConstFloatEvaluator.htm">NiConstFloatEvaluator</a></span>.
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiInterpolatorConverter</span> is utilized by the
streaming system to convert sequences from older versions of Gamebryo to the
new format. Additionally, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiControllerExtractor/NiControllerExtractor.htm">NiControllerExtractor</a></span>
relies upon <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiInterpolatorConverter</span> to
generate evaluators for <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm">NiSequenceData</a></span>
objects.</p>

<p>- Added a suite of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiInterpController.htm#UpdateValue">UpdateValue</a></span>
functions to <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiInterpController.htm">NiInterpController</a></span>
and its derived classes. These methods force the controller to push the
specified value into the associated scene graph attribute. This particular
interface is utilized by the sequence-based animation system.</p><a name=
"Consolidation_of_the_interpolator_controller_network" id=
"Consolidation_of_the_interpolator_controller_network"></a>

<h2>Consolidation of the interpolator/controller network</h2>

<p>The network of interpolators, blend interpolators, and interp controllers
which transmits data from active animation sequences to associated scene graph
targets has been consolidated in Gamebryo 2.6. This large network of narrow
data pipes has been replaced by a smaller system of wide data pipes. The new
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiPoseBuffer.htm">NiPoseBuffer</a></span> class
acts as a "wide" data container that transports a snapshot of animated data for
the entire character from an active sequence to its scene graph targets. New
classes and enumerations which support this change include <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBuffer</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiPoseBinding.htm">NiPoseBinding</a></span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiPoseBlender.htm">NiPoseBlender</a></span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiMultiTargetPoseHandler.htm">NiMultiTargetPoseHandler</a></span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiPoseBufferHandle.htm">NiPoseBufferHandle</a></span>,
and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiPoseBuffer.htm#NiPoseBufferChannelType">NiPoseBufferChannelType</a></span>.
This consolidation is primarily internal to the Gamebryo sequence animation
system and has minimal impact on applications using the high level interface of
sequence animation. As described below, a small number of supported functions
were affected by this change.</p>

<p>Read the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm">Overview of
NiControllerManager</a> for a synopsis of the new pose buffer system.</p>

<h3>NiControllerManager and NiActorManager functionality</h3>

<p>The following are modifications to the previously supported <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> interface.</p>

<p>- Added an optional <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span>
parameter to the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Constructors">NiControllerManager
constructor</a></span> as well as <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm#Constructors">NiActorManager::Create</a></span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ReloadNIFFile</span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ChangeNIFRoot</span>. A new <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span> is created for the character when this
parameter is <span class="NDLSystemFont">NULL</span>. There must be a unique
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span> for each unique character
template in an application. However, characters utilizing identical 3D models
and associated sets of animation sequences may share a single <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span> as a memory and performance optimization.
This new parameter allows characters to share a given <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span>. See the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm">Overview of
NiControllerManager</a> for a summary of the new pose buffer system including
the role of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span>.</p>

<p>- Extended <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager::Clone</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager::Clone</span> such that the cloned
character automatically shares the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span> of the source character.</p>

<p>- Added <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager::GetPoseBinding</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetPoseBlender</span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetMultiTargetPoseHandler</span> to access the manager's helper
objects. Refer to the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm">Overview of
NiControllerManager</a> for the roles played by these objects in the new pose
buffer system.</p>

<h3>Interpolator and controller functionality</h3>

<p>The following modifications affect the internals of the Gamebryo sequence
animation system and do not impact the high level interface of sequence
animation. No conversion is necessary for these changes unless your application
implemented custom interpolators and interp controllers for sequence-based
animation.</p>

<p>- Replaced the role of <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiBlendInterpolator.htm">blend interpolators</a>
with <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBlender</span> which has the ability to
blend data from multiple pose buffers. Blend interpolators are no longer
utilized for sequence-based animation; however, your application is still free
to use blend interpolators for non-sequence based animation.</p>

<p>- Deprecated and removed <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiBlendAccumTransformInterpolator</span>. This class became
obsolete with the introduction of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMultiTargetPoseHandler</span> class. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMultiTargetPoseHandler</span> is now responsible for handling
and maintaining the accumulation transform on animated characters.</p>

<p>- Replaced the role of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiTransformController.htm">NiTransformController</a></span>
objects with <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMultiTargetPoseHandler</span> for
sequence-based animation. Since the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMultiTargetPoseHandler</span> propagates data directly to
scene graph transform nodes any <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTransformController</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiMultiTargetTransformController.htm">NiMultiTargetTransformController</a></span>
objects in the associated scene graph are superfluous. As such, these
controllers are now removed from the scene graph during export by the <a href=
"../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Controller_Extractor.htm">Controller Extractor
export plug-in</a>. Your application is still free to use <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTransformController</span> objects for non-sequence-based
animation.</p>

<p>- Deprecated <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMultiTargetTransformController</span>. This class became
obsolete with the introduction of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMultiTargetPoseHandler</span> class. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMultiTargetPoseHandler</span> is now responsible for
propagating transform values from animated sequences to the appropriate scene
graph nodes. The class still maintains a few functions, primarily to stream
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMultiTargetTransformController</span> objects
that reside in older NIF files. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMultiTargetTransformController</span> objects which exist in
older NIF files are removed from the scene graph as the file is loaded.</p>

<p>- Added a suite of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiInterpController.htm#UpdateValue">UpdateValue</a></span>
functions to <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiInterpController.htm">NiInterpController</a></span>
and its derived classes. These methods force the controller to push the
specified value into the associated scene graph attribute. This particular
interface is utilized by the sequence-based animation system.</p><a name=
"Increasing_the_role_of_NiControllerManager__Update" id=
"Increasing_the_role_of_NiControllerManager__Update"></a>

<h2>Increasing the role of NiControllerManager::Update</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm">NiControllerManager</a></span>
now plays a larger role in handling sequence animation. In particular,
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_updating">NiControllerManager::Update</a></span>
now forces the evaluators within each active sequence to compute their latest
values, blends this data from multiple active sequences, propagates the
composite result to the appropriate scene graph targets, and shuts down any
active sequences which have now completed. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> maintains several helper objects to
assist with this task including an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiPoseBinding.htm">NiPoseBinding</a></span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiPoseBlender.htm">NiPoseBlender</a></span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=

and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSkinningLODController.htm">NiSkinningLODController</a></span>.
Refer to the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm">Overview of
NiControllerManager</a> for a summary of the controller manager, its helper
classes, and a typical usage pattern. Although these changes are largely behind
the scenes and internal to the animation system they produce a timing
side-effect that might affect your application.</p>

<p>This modification alters the timing as to when scene graph attributes,
including local transform values, are updated by the sequence animation system.
Previously, animated attributes were not computed and written to the scene
graph during the call to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager::Update</span>. Instead, these operations
were delayed until the scene graph <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm#UpdateFunctions">Update</a></span>
traversal visited the scene graph object containing the animated attribute.
This traversal operation proceeded from the scene graph root node to the leaf
nodes. This ordering guaranteed the attributes in ancestor nodes, including
world transforms, were up-to-date when a given node was visited. This property
no longer holds true now that <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager::Update</span> computes the animated values
for the entire character and distributes these to its scene graph branch.</p>

<p>This change in behavior affects evaluators which rely upon external entities
when computing their animated value. For example, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiLookAtEvaluator.htm">NiLookAtEvaluator</a></span>
calculates a transform value such that its "driven" object always faces an
external "look at" object. If an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiLookAtEvaluator</span> is contained within an animated
sequence, this computation will occur in Gamebryo 2.6 when the scene graph
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> traversal reaches the node associated
with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span>. Since the
descendant nodes have yet to be visited by the traversal their local and world
space transforms will correspond to values from the previous update frame. As a
result, the driven transform computed by <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiLookAtEvaluator</span> will always lag one frame behind. This
new behavior has minimal visual impact when frame rates are sufficiently
high.</p><a name="Extensions_to_the_animation_callback_systems" id=
"Extensions_to_the_animation_callback_systems"></a>

<h2>Extensions to the animation callback systems</h2>

<p>As discussed <a href=
"NiAnimation_Conversion.htm#Separation_of_NiControllerSequence_into_two_classes">
above</a> in this Conversion Guide, Gamebryo 2.6 utilizes two classes to
represent animated sequences: <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm">NiSequenceData</a></span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerSequence.htm">NiControllerSequence</a></span>.
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects contain the
shareable, heavyweight data of exported animation sequences saved in KF files.
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects are temporary
runtime entities created upon sequence activation. These lighter weight objects
maintain instance-based state to play back the animated sequence on a
particular character, and are destroyed or <a href=

shortly after the active sequence runs to completion. As described below, the
animation callback systems within <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm">NiActorManager</a></span> have
been enhanced to support this fundamental change.</p>

<h3>NiControllerSequence functionality</h3>

<p>The following are modifications to the previously supported <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> interface.</p>

<p>- Renamed <span class="NDLSystemFont">CallbackObject</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm#Callback_Objects">ActivationCallback</a></span>
to avoid confusion with the identically named <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager::CallbackObject</span> class. Moved <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ActivationCallback</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>.</p>

<p>- Refactored the functions which handle and maintain callback objects. Now,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> works with default callbacks
which are copied to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>
objects upon sequence activation. After activation, the callback list within a
given <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> can be adjusted
via the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> interface
without affecting the default callbacks within its source <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>. These new functions now operate on
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData::ActivationCallback</span> objects,
and are renamed based on their new roles:</p>

<p><!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->  <span class="NDLSystemFont">
<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->AddActivationCallbackObject</span> has become
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm#Functions_related_to_callback_objects">
NiSequenceData::AddDefaultActivationCallback</a></span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerSequence.htm#Functions_related_to_callback_objects">
NiControllerSequence::AddActivationCallback</a></span>.</p>

<p><!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->  <span class="NDLSystemFont">
<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->RemoveActivationCallbackObject</span> has become
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=

NiSequenceData::RemoveDefaultActivationCallback</a></span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerSequence.htm#Functions_related_to_callback_objects">
NiControllerSequence::RemoveActivationCallback</a></span>.</p>

<p><!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->  <span class="NDLSystemFont">
<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->GetActivationCallbackCount</span> has become
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=

NiSequenceData::GetDefaultActivationCallbackCount</a></span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=

NiControllerSequence::GetActivationCallbackCount</a></span>.</p>

<p><!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->  <span class="NDLSystemFont">
<!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->GetActivationCallbackObjectAt</span> has become
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=

NiSequenceData::GetDefaultActivationCallbackA</a>t</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=

NiControllerSequence::GetActivationCallbackAt</a></span>.</p>

<h3>NiControllerManager and NiActorManager functionality</h3>

<p>The following are modifications to the previously supported <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> interface.</p>

<p>- Introduced a new usage pattern for handling active sequences. As described
in an earlier <a href=
"NiAnimation_Conversion.htm#Separation_of_NiControllerSequence_into_two_classes">
section</a> of this Conversion Guide, sequence activation and transition
functions now return pointers to newly created <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerSequence.htm">NiControllerSequence</a></span>
objects representing the newly activated sequences. The animation system holds
references on these <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>
objects until the associated animation runs to completion, at which point these
references are released (or <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Sequence_Recycling">recycled</a>).</p>

<p>If your application needs to hang onto these <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects, say, to programmatically
adjust the sequence weight during animation playback, smart pointers or similar
reference counting mechanisms should be utilized to prevent stale pointers once
the animations run to completion. Depending on your implementation, you should
use one of the following techniques to determine when to release these held
pointers.</p>

<p>Applications which directly utilize <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm">NiControllerManager</a></span>
to handle sequence animation should add an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm#Callback_Objects">NiSequenceData::ActivationCallback</a></span>
to held <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects. The
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm#Callback_Objects">ActivationChanged</a></span>
method of this callback will be executed whenever the active sequence enters a
new animation state. A held <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> should be released when its
callback signals the active sequence has entered the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerSequence.htm#NiAnimState">INACTIVE</a></span>
animation state. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>
will be destroyed or recycled automatically after its last reference is
released.</p>

<p>If your application relies upon <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm">NiActorManager</a></span>
instead of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> to play
animations, your application should set a <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm#Callback_Objects">callback
object</a> on the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> and
register the sequence for the new <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm#Event_Types">ANIM_COMPLETED</a></span>
event type. The new <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm#Callback_Objects">CallbackObject::AnimCompleted</a></span>
function will be executed when the specified sequence runs to completion. Upon
receiving this event, the held <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> should be released. The
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> will be destroyed or
recycled automatically when its last reference is released.</p>

<p>- Extended <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> to inherit from
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData::ActivationCallback</span> so it can
receive notification when an active sequence has completed. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> uses this information to support its new
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ANIM_COMPLETED</span> event type.</p>

<p>- Streamlined the behavior of activation callbacks during transitions
between sequences. Previously, functions which initiate sequence transitions
such as <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_cross_fading_two_sequences">
NiControllerManager::CrossFade</a></span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_blend_transitions">
BlendFromSequence</a></span>, and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_morph_transitions">
Morph</a></span> triggered two or more callback events on the active source
sequence. Now, the activation callback is executed just once on the source and
destination sequences during these types of transitions, and the communicated
state is the final state of each sequence.</p><a name=

<h2>Improvements in transformation accumulation</h2>

<p><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Transformation_Accumulation">
Transformation accumulation</a> has been refactored in Gamebryo 2.6 to improve
robustness and usability. Its implementation in previous Gamebryo releases
exhibited a number of quirky behaviors including:</p>

<p>- The inability to access the accumulation root node until at least one
sequence was loaded by the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span></a>.</p>

<p>- The possibility of invalid data for the scale, translation, and/or
rotation components of the accumulation transform. An invalid rotation was
particularly troublesome because valid translations behaved incorrectly due to
the dependency of translation on the rotation value.</p>

<p>- Lack of support to get or set the value of the accumulation transform
until a sequence containing an accumulation transform channel was played on the
character.</p>

<p>- Setting the accumulation transform via <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_relating_to_transformation_accumulation">
NiControllerManager::SetAccumulatedTransform</a></span> did not affect the
values in the accumulation root node until the next sequence containing an
accumulation transform channel was played on the character.</p>

<p>- Dropping one frame of motion at the start or end of a transition depending
on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Gamebryo 2.6 resolves these issues through the following changes in behavior
when transformation accumulation is enabled on a character:</p>

<p>- The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Constructors">NiControllerManager
constructor</a></span> now searches the character's scene graph branch for the
accumulation root node. A pointer to this node is cached so the accumulation
root is immediately accessible via <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_relating_to_transformation_accumulation">
NiControllerManager::GetAccumRoot</a></span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm">NiActorManager</a>::GetAccumRoot</span>.
Transformation accumulation is disabled on the character if the accumulation
root node cannot be located. The constructor relies upon a new static function
named <span class="NDLSystemFont">FindAccumRoot</span> to locate the
accumulation node. This function assumes the accumulation root is the first
node having a child node of similar name that's augmented with a " <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NonAccum</span>" suffix.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDetailedDescription">Note: The scene graph pattern of
parent and child nodes having similar names whereby the child's name equals the
parent's name concatenated with " NonAccum" is reserved for use by Emergent.
Artists should avoid this naming convention when creating models in 3ds max and
Maya to ensure correct operation of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FindAccumRoot</span>. For example, a node named "elbow" should
not have a child node named "elbow NonAccum".</p>

<p>- Upon finding the accumulation root node the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> constructor pushes the transform on
the root to its non-accum child node. This adjustment ensures the initial
transform on the accumulation root is identity, as if no accum flags had been
set on the accum root node during export. Pushing this transform to the
non-accum child node has no visible effect on the 3D model, but makes its
transform values compatible with sequences containing accumulation transform
channels. The accumulation transform associated with the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> is initialized with the final
transform on the accumulation root node. In general, this is the identity
transform. This change in behavior ensures the manager's accumulation transform
is valid, and it matches the value of the accumulation root node. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_relating_to_transformation_accumulation">
NiControllerManager::GetAccumulatedTransform</a></span> may be called
immediately after construction to obtain the value of the character's
accumulation transform. Similarly, <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_relating_to_transformation_accumulation">
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SetAccumulatedTransform</span></a> may be called
immediately after construction to modify the value of the character's
accumulation transform.</p>

<p>- <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager::SetAccumulatedTransform</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_relating_to_transformation_accumulation">
ClearCumulativeAnimations</a></span> have been modified to immediately
propagate any changes in the accumulation transform to the local transform of
the accumulation root node. This change in behavior increases the consistency
between the character's accumulation transform and the transform of the
accumulation root node.</p>

<p>- A bug in the transformation accumulation code was fixed that caused one
frame of motion to be dropped from a sequence at the start or end of a
transition depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>- The new <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_relating_to_transformation_accumulation">
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager::GetAccumRootName</span></a>
function may be used to obtain the name of the accumulation root node.</p>
