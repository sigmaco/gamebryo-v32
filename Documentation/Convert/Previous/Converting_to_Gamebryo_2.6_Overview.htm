<h1>Converting to Gamebryo 2.6 Overview</h1>

<p>This document describes the changes to interfaces that existed
in Gamebryo 2.5. It is intended to help users of Gamebryo 2.5
convert to Gamebryo 2.6. This document does not describe all the
new features in Gamebryo 2.6. For that, see the <a href=
"../../RelNotes/Release_Notes_Introduction.htm">Release
Notes</a>.</p>

<a name="Changes_to_NiAllocator" id="Changes_to_NiAllocator"></a><h2>Changes to NiAllocator</h2>

<p>The <a href=
"../../Reference/NiSystem/NiAllocator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAllocator</span></a> interface has been changed
to support memory hints. The primary effect of these changes on a
custom allocator are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Significant additional information passed in the form of
    an <a href=
    "../../Reference/NiSystem/NiMemHint.htm"><span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiMemHint</span></a> object <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">kHint</span>.</li>

    <li>The information conveyed by the argument <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">bProvideAccurateSizeOnDeallocate</span> is
    now obtained by calling <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">kHint.CompilerProvidesSizeOnDeallocate()</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The hint information comes from an argument to the extended
<a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiMemoryDefines.htm">allocation
functions</a> (<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNew2</span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMalloc2</span>, etc...). If the
standard functions are used, a default hint containing no
information is passed in. The hint object potentially includes
information such as desired memory arenas and the expected
lifetime or usage of the allocated memory. This information can
be used to make better choices when allocating or for getting an
accurate picture of the allocated memory.</p>

<p>For more information on the new method signatures, see the
<a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiAllocator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAllocator</span></a> documentation. For more
information on memory hints, see the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMemHint</span> <a href=
"../../Reference/NiSystem/NiMemHint.htm">reference</a>.</p>

<a name="Changes_to_NiAnimation" id="Changes_to_NiAnimation"></a><h2>Changes to NiAnimation</h2>

<p>Sequence-based animation in the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/Introduction_to_Animation.htm">NiAnimation</a>
library has been refactored. These changes are documented on a
<a href="NiAnimation_Conversion.htm">separate
page</a>.</p>

<a name="NiPrimitiveType" id="NiPrimitiveType"></a><h2>NiPrimitiveType</h2>

<p>The enumeration <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMesh::PrimitiveType</span> has been replaced
with the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPrimitiveType.htm">NiPrimitiveType::Type</a></span>
enumeration in the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/Hyperlinked_Hierarchy_of_Classes.htm">NiMain</a>
library.</p>

<a name="Changes_to_NiDataStream__LockType_flags" id="Changes_to_NiDataStream__LockType_flags"></a><h2>Changes to NiDataStream::LockType flags</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm#class_ni_data_stream_1bc4b62a87d68da7491b406f7f4889da2">
NiDataStream::LockType</a></span> flags and how they are
interpreted has been changed. The behavior of the
platform-specific classes derived from <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> has been changed so that when
the stream is locked with the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LOCK_TOOL_READ</span> or <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LOCK_TOOL_WRITE</span> flags, the lock will
always succeed, although the operation may be very un-optimal and
may take a significant amount of time. Runtime applications are
discouraged from attempting to use the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LOCK_TOOL_READ</span> or <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LOCK_TOOL_WRITE</span> flags unless they are
willing to pay the performance penalty for the successful
lock.</p>

<p>A related change is that when <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiToolDataStream.htm">NiToolDataStream</a></span>
objects are locked for read or write, the lock will always
succeed, even if the data stream does not contain the appropriate
access flags.</p>

<a name="Changes_to_NiDataStream__LockRead_and_LockWrite" id="Changes_to_NiDataStream__LockRead_and_LockWrite"></a><h2>Changes to NiDataStream::LockRead and LockWrite</h2>

<p>As a result of the change in behavior of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm#class_ni_data_stream_1bc4b62a87d68da7491b406f7f4889da2">
NiDataStream::LockType</a></span> flags, the functions
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::LockRead</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::LockWrite</span> have
been changed to only pass in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LOCK_READ</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LOCK_WRITE</span> flags, respectively, to the
locking functions. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::UnlockRead</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::UnlockWrite</span> have been
similarly changed. Since the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LOCK_TOOL_READ</span> or <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LOCK_TOOL_WRITE</span> flags are no longer
provided by those functions, the functions may well fail when
operating on platform-specific classes derived from <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span>.</p>

<a name="Changes_to_the_NiEntity_Library" id="Changes_to_the_NiEntity_Library"></a><h2>Changes to the NiEntity Library</h2>

<p>To support layers and prefabs at runtime, several changes were
made to classes in the NiEntity 
library. The most significant changes are to the entity streaming
classes, which were modified to support loading of externally
referenced layer and palette files. The pertinent changes to this
library are documented below.</p>

<h3>NiEntityPropertyInterface</h3>

<p>Two member variables have been added to this interface: a
unique ID and a source filename. The constructor for <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiEntityPropertyInterface</span> automatically
generates a new unique ID to guarantee that no two entities or
components have the same ID. For more information, see NiEntityPropertyInterface.</p>

<h3>NiUniqueID</h3>

<p>A static <span class="NDLSystemFont">Generate</span> function
was added to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiUniqueID</span> that
provides UUID generation on Win32. On PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii, a
random (but not universally unique) value is generated. As such,
saving out scenes is now prohibited on those platforms, since any
entities converted or created on those platforms will not have
unique IDs.</p>

<p>Functions were also added to support converting unique IDs to
and from strings, and some helper functions were added to support
storing <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiUniqueID</span> pointers in
<a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTMap.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTMap</span></a> structures. For more
information, see NiUniqueID.</p>

<h3>NiEntityInterface</h3>

<p>The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiEntityInterface::GetMasterEntity</span>
function has been made const. Any derived entity classes will
need to be updated in order to properly compile.</p>

<p>A member variable, prefab root, has been added to this
interface to support the concept of prefabs. The prefab root
pointer is null if the entity is not part of a prefab. If the
entity is part of a prefab then the prefab root will point to its
owning prefab root. The prefab root will have an instance of an
<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPrefabComponent</span> that contains
pointers to all of its prefab entities.</p>

<p>Because cloning a prefab root must clone all of the prefab
entities, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiEntityInterface::Clone</span> cannot properly
clone a prefab root. It will instead clone just the root and will
return a pointer to the cloned entity with no prefab entities
under it. To clone a prefab you should use the new <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiEntityCloneHelper</span> class. See the
description of it for more information about this and other uses
of the new class. For more information, see NiEntityInterface.</p>

<h3>NiEntityComponentInterface</h3>

<p>The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiEntityComponentInterface::GetMasterComponent</span>
function has been made const. Any derived component classes will
need to be updated in order to properly compile. For more
information, see NiEntityComponentInterface.</p>

<h3>NiEntitySelectionSet</h3>

<p>Selection set behavior has been changed to keep the other
entities in order when an entity is removed from the selection
set. For more information, see NiEntitySelectionSet.</p>

<h3>NiDOMTool</h3>

<p>Several member variables have been added to this class to
store information about scenes that is needed during streaming,
such as the version number and the full path of the file that was
loaded. For more information, see NiDOMTool.</p>

<h3>NiEntityStreaming/NiEntityStreamingAscii</h3>

<p>The streaming classes have been modified to support loading
multiple scenes, depending on whether or not the main scene being
loaded externally references other scenes.</p>

<p>The Load function has been changed to accept a Boolean
indicating whether or not all loaded scenes should be
concatenated into a single large scene. This is the default
behavior and will provide similar behavior to the old behavior of
this class. Thus, applications that expect there to be a single
scene loaded from a scene file can still get that behavior. If
this Boolean is false, each loaded scene will be stored
separately, with access provided by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetSceneCount</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetSceneAt</span> functions.</p>

<p>The Save function has been changed to accept a scene index to
save. If multiple scenes exist in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiEntityStreaming</span> object when Save is
called, the provided index specifies which scene to save. Only
one scene can be saved to disk with a single call to the Save
function. Only entities that have a source filename the same as
the file being saved will be saved out. When an entity is added
to a scene, it has its source filename set to match that of the
scene. However, if all loaded scenes were concatenated into a
single large scene upon load, the source filename for the
entities is preserved to be their original filenames. Thus,
saving out such a combined scene will only save out the entities
that were originally in that scene file.</p>

<p>Loaded scenes are now retained by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiEntityStreaming</span> object until it is
destructed or the Reset function is called. This is to support
data sharing between loaded scenes. If two scenes are loaded that
both reference the same third scene, only one copy of the third
scene's entities will reside in memory. If a scene is listed in
the loaded scenes for the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiEntityStreaming</span> object, loading it again
will not reload the file from disk but will instead use the one
in memory. Scenes can be individually removed with the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">RemoveLoadedScene</span> function,
and all loaded scenes can be removed by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Reset</span> or <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ClearLoadedScenes</span> functions. There is also
now an option on the Load function to fully load all referenced
scenes or only those entities that are necessary. This is mostly
pertinent for palettes, as you may not want to load all palettes
at runtime. This option by default only loads entities needed by
the scene, but Scene Designer always fully loads all scenes to
avoid multiple loading from disk.</p>

<p>Functions have been added that return whether or not a loaded
scene was converted or modified during the loading operation.
Scene files are converted when loaded from an old file version.
They may be modified if links to other entities cannot be
properly resolved. In that case, the links will be removed and
messages will be sent to the registered error handler.</p>

<p>Because template dependencies are resolved at runtime now
palette files must be available in order to load any scene file.
For more information, see NiEntityStreaming/NiEntityStreamingAscii.</p>

<h3>NiScene</h3>

<p>An array of layer filenames has been added to this class that
specifies the explicit layers upon which this scene depends.
Also, a source filename member variable has been added that
specifies the full path to the filename from which this scene was
loaded. Finally, a <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetEntityByID</span> function has been added to
provide quick lookup of an entity object in the scene using its
unique ID. For more information, see NiScene.</p>

<h3>NiInheritedTransformationComponent</h3>

<p>This class has been removed and its functionality rolled into
NiTransformationComponent.
See NiTransformationComponent for more information. Any file that
is loaded that references an NiInheritedTransformationComponent
will be updated to refer to an instance of an
NiTransformationComponent instead. The
NiInheritedTransformationComponent source files must be removed
from the AppFrameworks\UtilityLibs\NiEntity directory before the
NiEntity project will properly build for Wii. For more
information, see NiInheritedTransformationComponent.</p>

<a name="Changes_to_the_Scene_Designer_API" id="Changes_to_the_Scene_Designer_API"></a><h2>Changes to the Scene Designer API</h2>

<h3>Writable Flag</h3>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MLayer</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MScene</span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MEntity</span> all have the concept of
writable/read-only state now. This cannot be enforced everywhere
but in debug builds will throw an assertion if an attempt is made
to change a read-only entity, scene, or layer. The entity will
check upwards, to see if its owning layer is read-only, so in
general it is only necessary to check an entity before changing
its properties or removing it. You should also check the status
of a layer (including the default layer) before adding entities
or layers to it. This is done everywhere in Scene Designer, but
custom plug-ins will need to pay special attention to this.
Failure to do this may cause crashes or, if running in debug
mode, an assertion will occur with the following text:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Object is read-only and cannot be
modified!</span></p>

<h3>Layers</h3>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">MLayer</span> is a new class to represent
sub-layers in a scene file. All entities must be in one and only
one layer. They can be in the default layer (the main file) but
they cannot be there and in another layer. To render entities
correctly and to simplify code that needs to walk through all
entities, entities are also added to a single "main scene". Any
time an entity is added to the main scene (as returned by
<span class="NDLSystemFont">MFramework::Scene</span>) it will
also be added to the current, or active, layer.</p>

<p>Because there can be multiple scenes loaded, walking through
entities might return different source filenames.</p>

<h3>Autosave</h3>

<p>Autosave used to save a single scene file in the temp
directory. Now, because of layers, Autosave may create more than
one file (one for each layer) and they will be placed in the
directory beside the file being saved with a ".autosave"
suffix.</p>

<h3>Interaction Modes</h3>

<p>Prefabs and layers necessitated several changes in the Interaction Modes.
Because some layers can be read-only you must check to see if
there is an active layer before creating any entities. The tool
does not allow any of the existing interaction modes to be
entered if there is no active layer but if you create a new
interaction mode you will need to make sure this holds true as
well.</p>

<p>Prefabs can contain multiple entities so cloning a object from
an interaction mode, or creating an instance of a prefab from one
may create multiple entities. Your code will need to be prepared
to handle any number of entities being created from a create or
clone operation.</p>

<a name="Changes_to_the_NiTerrain_Library" id="Changes_to_the_NiTerrain_Library"></a><h2>Changes to the NiTerrain Library</h2>

<h3>Include File Rename</h3>

<p>The main include file for the terrain library has been renamed
to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainLib.h</span> to allow for
the creation of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrain</span>
class.</p>

<h3>LOD Naming Convention</h3>

<p>In previous versions of Gamebryo, the highest level of detail
of a terrain (the highest resolution) was known as level 0. Above
this, there were .lower' levels of detail which represented the
terrain with less geometric detail. The naming convention now
states that level 0 is the least detailed, with additional higher
numbered levels of detail introducing more detail. Any code that
uses the terrain interactor should take this into account when
defining a custom value for <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">uiDetailLevel</span> function parameters. If
interaction with the highest available detail is desired, use the
following public static member of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainUtils</span> namespace when specifying a
LOD level:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiUInt32
NiTerrainUtils::ms_uiMAX_LOD</span></p>

<h3>Deprecation of NiTerrainSectorComponent</h3>

<p>In Gamebryo 2.5, to create a terrain within Scene Designer a
designer would need to work with two entities; one containing an
<span class="NDLSystemFont">
NiTerrainComponent</span> with the other containing an
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSectorComponent</span>.
Since the NiTerrain library has been re-worked such that you can
add a <a href=
"../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrain.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTerrain</span></a> object directly to an
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span> derived scene, it is no
longer strictly necessary to use the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiEntity</span> system to create a terrain. As a
result of this, the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSectorComponent</span>
is no longer required.</p>

<h3>The NiTerrainComponent Now Contains all Terrain Related
Properties and Simply Wraps an NiTerrain Object</h3>

<p>While the NiTerrain library can still load GSA files
containing the old format, it is recommended to update your files
to reflect this change. The 2.6 version of Scene Designer is able
to convert old files to the new format; it will prompt to do so
when an old file is opened.</p>

<h3>NiTerrainComponent</h3>

<p>To support the depreciation of the 
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSectorComponent</span>,
some properties previously found within the sector component have
been moved to the terrain component. The following properties
were moved:</p>

<ul>
    <li>"Scene Root Pointer"</li>

    <li>"Default Surface Mask Size"</li>
</ul>

<h3>New Properties</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>Cook PhysX Data</b>&mdash;If the PhysX Scene Designer
    plug-in is present, PhysX data will be cooked when the scene
    is saved if this flag is set to true. Note, the PhysX plug-in
    also adds a "Cook PhysX Button" to the terrain command panel
    as well.</li>

    <li><b>Sector List</b>&mdash;Which sectors will are defined
    by this terrain object. Currently only a single sector is
    supported.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Terrain Archive Format</h3>

<p>The 'quadtree.dof' archive file contained within the terrain
archive directory has been modified to support more sophisticated
loading techniques, including loading the sector up to a certain
depth. While the terrain is still able to read in sector data of
the old format, it is recommended that GSA scene files containing
a terrain are re-saved in a 2.6 build of the scene designer. This
which will automatically update the archive files to the new
format.</p>

<h3>NiSurfacePalette Constructor</h3>

<p>The surface palette now has "tagging" permanently enabled, so
there is no longer a parameter in the constructor to toggle this
feature.</p>

<h3>Terrain Materials</h3>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSurface::GetName</span>
    function now returns a const reference to an <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiFixedString</span>.</li>

    <li>Refactored <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSurfacePalette::CompileSurface(NiFixedString)</span>
    to <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSurfacePalette::CompileSurfaces()</span>.
    It now compiles all surfaces contained in the palette.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Procedurally Importing RAW files</h3>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">LoadFromRAWFile</span>
function within the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSector</span> class has been removed.
The new method to import a raw file is:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mark the terrain as 'InToolMode' using the terrain
    interactor. ( <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainInteractor::SetInToolMode(true)</span>
    )</li>

    <li>Load the RAW file contents into a temporary buffer</li>

    <li>Send the buffer to the terrain: <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainInteractor::SetHeightFromMap(.);</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>NiMetaData Get/Set Functions</h3>

<p>In order to support different blending techniques for meta
data, the signature of the get/set functions in the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiMetaData.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMetaData</span></a> class has had an additional
parameter added to it.</p>

<h4>Old:</h4>
<pre>
bool Set(const NiFixedString&amp; kKey, NiInt32 iValue, float fWeight = 1.0f);
bool Set(const NiFixedString&amp; kKey, float fValue, float fWeight = 1.0f);
bool Set(const NiFixedString&amp; kKey, const NiFixedString&amp; kValue, float fWeight = 1.0f);
</pre>

<h4>New:</h4>
<pre>
bool Set(const NiFixedString&amp; kKey, NiInt32 iValue, KeyType eType = INTEGER, float fWeight = 1.0f);
bool Set(const NiFixedString&amp; kKey, float fValue, KeyType eType = FLOAT, float fWeight = 1.0f);
bool Set(const NiFixedString&amp; kKey, const NiFixedString&amp; kValue, KeyType eType = STRING, float fWeight = 1.0f);
</pre>

<p>Any code that uses these functions will need to be modified
accordingly.</p>

<a name="Changes_to_the_Wii_Renderer" id="Changes_to_the_Wii_Renderer"></a><h2>Changes to the Wii Renderer</h2>

<p>The renderer has been updated to work with the redesigned
geometry system introduced in Gamebryo 2.5. See the <a href=

<a name="New_Renderer_Selection_Dialog_in_NiApplication" id="New_Renderer_Selection_Dialog_in_NiApplication"></a><h2>New Renderer Selection Dialog in NiApplication</h2>

<p>Gamebryo 2.6 introduces a new <a href=
"../../Reference/NiApplication/Renderer_Settings_Dialog.htm">renderer
selection dialog</a> for samples and demos based on <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span>. Applications that derive
from <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span> can make
use of the dialog by calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiApplication::CreateRenderer</span> (either
explicitly or by letting the standard <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiApplication::Initialize</span> call it). If
they do, then they must link in the resource file located at
<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">$(EGB_PATH)\sdk\Win32\Resource\NiApplicationResource.rc</span>.
Failure to link in this resource file will result in the
following error when trying to create a renderer at runtime:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Error: Resource files are not
linked in. Please link file NiApplicationResource.rc into your
project. This file can be found in SDK\Win32\Resource.</span></p>

<p>Note that applications do not need to link in this resource
file if they will not call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiApplication::CreateRenderer</span>. If your
application will directly create a renderer without using the
Gamebryo-supplied dialog box, then there will be no consequence
for not linking in this resource file, even if other parts of
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span> are used.</p>
