<h1>NiPhysXScene Conversion</h1>

<p>The <a HREF="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span></a> class was re-factored for 
 Gamebryo 2.3 to enforce the concept of a master controller for a PhysX 
 scene (the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> object) and a 
 container for physical objects, <a HREF="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXProp.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXProp</span></a> objects, such as a crate, a 
 rag-doll, or a physical machine. Here we use the word &quot;prop&quot; 
 in the sense of &quot;stage prop&quot; or &quot;movie prop&quot;. See 
 the <a HREF="../../Programmer/Introduction_to_GamebryoPhysX_Programming.htm">Gamebryo-PhysX 
 Programmers Guide</a> and the <a HREF="../../Reference/Introduction_to_Gamebryo_PhysX.htm">Reference 
 Documentation</a> for information on using these new classes.</p>

<p>The timing mechanism was also changed so that Gamebryo 
 completely overrides any application calls to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene::setTiming</span>. 
 If your application was using this function, please see the <a HREF="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#simulation_functions">NiPhysXScene 
 reference documentation</a> related to time management and modify your 
 code to use Gamebryo functions.</p>

<h2>Refactoring from Master/Slave to Scene/Prop</h2>

<p>In previous versions of Gamebryo, all PhysX content 
 was managed through <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> objects 
 that could be slaved to each other to merge them into one PhysX scene. 
 The new system introduces a one-to-one correspondence between <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> 
 objects and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene</span> objects. All of the 
 functionality associated with a scene - updating, simulation, debug rendering 
 - has been retained in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> 
 class. Any functionality related to streaming or cloning actors, or groups 
 of actors, has been moved to the new <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXProp</span> 
 class. Think of a prop as a self-contained PhysX object. A scene is made 
 up of multiple props that interact with each other, while a prop is non-divisible 
 as far as Gamebryo is concerned. Physical particle systems and fluids 
 are now attached to props rather than a scene. See the <a HREF="../../Reference/NiPhysXParticle/Introduction_to_NiPhysXParticle_Class_Reference.htm">NiPhysXParticle</a> 
 and <a HREF="../../Reference/NiPhysXFluid/Introduction_to_NiPhysXFluid_Class_Reference.htm">NiPhysXFluid</a> 
 reference for more details.</p>

<p>Updating of Gamebryo-PhysX sources and destinations 
 is now done through a single call on the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> 
 object, which causes all the props to be updated (providing the sources 
 and destinations are active). Functions have also been added to the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> class to update a single source 
 or destination.</p>

<p>The art tools now stream <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXProp</span> 
 objects out of Max and Maya. Applications that load a NIF file should 
 now look for these objects among the top-level objects in the NIF. The 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> object should be created 
 by the application (it is not streamed) and the loaded props added to 
 it. See the <a HREF="../../Learn/Tutorials/Introduction_to_the_Gamebryo_PhysX_Tutorial.htm">PhysX 
 Tutorials</a> for a simple example. All the samples have also been converted.</p>

<h2>Loading Old NIF Files</h2>

<p>Gamebryo NIF files with PhysX content now contain <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXProp</span> objects at the top-level. Older 
 NIF files contain <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> objects 
 at the top level, and these must be converted to the new arrangement as 
 part of the loading process. This process is done automatically when a 
 NIF older than version 20.3.0.0 is loaded, but applications should note 
 the following:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>After loading an older 
 NIF file, there will be a <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> 
 object at the top level, as with older versions of Gamebryo. This <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> object will have <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXProp</span> 
 objects pre-attached.</li>
	
	<li>If the old NIF files 
 contained fluid content, then the top-level <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> 
 object will have a snapshot of type <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXFluidSceneDesc</span>. 
 Applications must call the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXFluidSceneDesc::ConvertToProp</span> 
 function to create a <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXProp</span> object 
 before attempting to use the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> 
 object.</li>
</ul>
