<h1>NiPick Conversion</h1>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<p>Picking now has an option to pick against the Alternate
Bounding Volume (ABV) associated with a node in the scene graph.
To activate this, there is a new member of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">IntersectType</span> enumeration: <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">INTERSECT_COLLISION_DATA</span>.</p>

<p>Since not all nodes in the scene graph have collision data
associated, a new property of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/NiPick.htm">NiPick</a></span> class
is the <span class="NDLSystemFont">FallbackType</span>, which
defines the behavior of a pick if no collision data is found and
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">IntersectType</span> is set to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">INTERSECT_COLLISION_DATA</span>.</p>

<p>Picking follows the propagation semantics in the same fashion
as collisions using ABVs. An <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span> object without ABV data will always
propagate the pick request to its children.</p>

<p>When picking on collision data, the intersection distance,
intersection position, and normal are returned as part of the
pick record. No other data (such as color, texture coordinate,
etc) are valid, since the ABV does not contain such data.</p>

<p>Picking now also supports a new <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/NiPick__PickObjectPolicy.htm">NiPick::PickObjectPolicy</a></span>.
This class allows applications to insert custom behavior for
invocation when triangle level picking is required.</p>

<h2>API Changes</h2>

<p>In order to clarify the behavior of the picking traversal,
some changes have been made to the way the sorting and query are
defined for a pick operation. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PickType</span> property has been renamed to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">QueryType</span> and now has three
members of the enumeration: <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">QUERY_FIRST</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">QUERY_CLOSEST</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">QUERY_ALL</span>. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SortType</span> members have been renamed to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SORT_ON</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SORT_OFF</span> for clarity, and this property is
only used for <span class="NDLSystemFont">QUERY_ALL</span>
requests.</p>

<p>The table below summarizes how to convert old code to the new
properties:</p>

<!--(Table)=========================================================-->
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Old PickType</th>

            <th>Old SortType</th>

            <th>New QueryType</th>

            <th>New SortType</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">FIND_ALL</span></td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">SORT</span></td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">QUERY_ALL</span></td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">SORT_ON</span></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">FIND_ALL</span></td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">NO_SORT</span></td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">QUERY_ALL</span></td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">SORT_OFF</span></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">FIND_FIRST</span></td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">SORT</span></td>

            <td><span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">QUERY_CLOSEST</span></td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">(unused)</span></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">FIND_FIRST</span></td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">NO_SORT</span></td>

            <td><span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">QUERY_FIRST</span></td>

            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">(unused)</span></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Upon creation, an NiPick instance now has the following
defaults:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">QUERY_ALL</span></p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">SORT_ON</span></p>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">INTERSECT_COLLISION_DATA</span></p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">FALLBACK_TRIANGLE</span></p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">COORDINATES_WORLD</span></p>

<p>For scenes that do not have any collision data attached to
objects, this will result in the same behavior as under Gamebryo
2.3. For scenes that do have collision data, that collision data
will be used instead of triangles. To determine whether a
<a href="../../Reference/NiCollision/NiPick__Record.htm"><span class="NDLSystemFont">
NiPick::Record</span></a> object contains triangle data or proxy
ABV data, call GetIndicesValid() on the object.</p>

<p>For consistency, all enumeration members are now defined to
have the first word the same throughout the enumeration, such as
INTERSECT_BOUND and INTERSECT_TRIANGLE. In the previous versions,
some were defined this way, while others had the shared word at
the end (such as the old BOUND_INTERSECT and TRIANGLE_INTERSECT)
or no shared word at all. Compilation errors about undefined
enumeration members are likely to be rectified by checking the
header for the new name.</p>

<h3>Enabling CPU Read Access for Picking</h3>

<p>N.B. The following information describes a method for
converting an application at runtime to use picking. The
preferred method is to use mesh profiles to set the appropriate
data access flags on appropriate objects at export from the DCC
tools. More information can be found in the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Collision_System_Usage.htm">collision
documentation</a>.</p>

<p>If your Gamebryo 2.3 application does picking and if it makes
use of calls such as <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PrecacheGeometry()</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetKeepFlags()</span> in order to enable CPU
reads (required for the CPU-based picking system), then some code
must be added to convert your application to Gamebryo 2.5.
Specifically, your application should now set the convenience
callback <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ForceCPUReadAccessCallback()</span> in the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreamFactory</span> to enable
CPU read access for all <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> objects that are created in
the process of loading NIF files with "pickable" data. (The
application calls to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PrecacheGeometry()</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetKeepFlags()</span> should be removed.)</p>

<p>For example, you could add the following statement immediately
before your calls to load NIF files with pickable data:</p>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::GetFactory()-&gt;SetCallback(NiDataStreamFactory::ForceCPUReadAccessCallback);</span></p>

<p>As a more detailed example, you may contrast the Picking demo
in Gamebryo 2.3, with its calls to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PrecacheGeometry()</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetKeepFlags()</span> [necessary to enable CPU
reads], with the Picking demo in Gamebryo 2.5, which no longer
makes such calls, but which now requires <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ForceCPUReadAccessCallback()</span>, since the
NIF file the demo uses has not been exported with ACCESS_CPU_READ
set for its data streams.</p>

<p>For pickable data in general, either (a) your assets must be
exported or converted such that the pickable data streams have
ACCESS_CPU_READ or (b) your app must include the step indicated
above. Otherwise, attempts to do picking will likely result in
errors comparable to:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">LOCK_READ on a stream without
ACCESS_CPU_READ</span></p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Warning: Geometry for NiPick
operation is missing.</span></p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">   May need to ensure that
CPU_READ is specified for POSITION</span></p>
