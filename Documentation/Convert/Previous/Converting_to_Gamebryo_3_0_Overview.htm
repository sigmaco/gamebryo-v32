<a name="DirReorg" id="DirReorg"></a><h2>Directory structure reorganization</h2>

<p>The directory structure in LightSpeed has changed significantly from previous versions of
Gamebryo.</p>

<p>For more detailed information about the changes, see <a href=
"../Announce/Directory_Structure_Reorganization.htm">Directory Structure
Reorganization</a>.</p>

<a name="LinkAndBuild" id="LinkAndBuild"></a><h2>Changes required for building and compiling Gamebryo LightSpeed</h2>

<p>The conversion steps that are required for building and compiling LightSpeed are outlined in the
following platform-specific sections:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="../../ee_goto.htm#Convert/Previous/Converting_to_Gamebryo_3_0_PC.htm">Converting
    to LightSpeed - PC</a></li>

    <li><a href="../../ee_goto.htm#Convert/Previous/Converting_to_Gamebryo_3_0_PS3.htm">Converting
    to LightSpeed - PS3</a></li>

    <li><a href=
    "../../ee_goto.htm#Convert/Previous/Converting_to_Gamebryo_3_0_Xbox360.htm">Converting to
    LightSpeed - Xbox 360</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="CustomMemoryAllocator" id="CustomMemoryAllocator"></a><h2>Changes in how the memory allocator is specified</h2>

<p>Because pre-main allocations are now possible, the memory allocator that is used for all of
Gamebryo LightSpeed must be specified at compile time instead of when <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiInit()</span> is called.</p>

<h4>Steps to take if Game specifies a custom <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAllocator</span> class
to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiInit()</span></h4>

<p>There are a few additional methods from the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__IAllocator.htm">IAllocator</a></span> interface that will need to be
implemented. The following block of code should be added to the application (typically in the file
containing the main entry point):</p>
<pre>
// Specify the custom allocator.  When the memory manager is initialized, it will call this
// method to retrieve an instance of a class implementing the IAllocator interface.  This
// method will be called pre-main, so the allocator should not rely on the static
// initialization of any other classes having occurred.
</pre>

<h4>Steps to take if Game does <em>not</em> specify a custom <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAllocator</span> class to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiInit()</span></h4>

<p>If the game is derived from <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span> then there are no
changes required. Otherwise, the following block of code should be added to the application
(typically in the file containing the main entry point):</p>
<pre>
// Make use of the default memory allocator implementation. For instructions
// on how to use a custom allocator, see the notes in &lt;efd/MemoryDefines.h&gt;.
#include &lt;efd/DefaultInitializeMemoryManager.h&gt;
EE_USE_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR;
</pre>

<a name="RenderOrderChanges" id="RenderOrderChanges"></a><h2>Changes to rendering order and the rendering pipeline</h2>

<p>The responsibility of rendering an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span> object has moved from <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderer.htm">NiRenderer</a></span> to
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiShader.htm">NiShader</a></span>. The
method <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader::RenderMeshes()</span> has been introduced, and the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderer::RenderMesh()</span> now calls <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShader::RenderMeshes()</span> on the render object's active shader. Having
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> objects be responsible for rendering batches of meshes
allows for custom NiShader classes that perform the minimum amount of work required to render an
object.</p>

<p>Additionally, the definition and use of different <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderer.htm">RenderingPhases</a></span> has been added to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderer</span> and the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderCallContext.htm">NiRenderCallContext</a></span>, respectively. An
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> object can specify which <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RenderingPhases</span> are active as it renders a batch of meshes. For example,
while rendering the first <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> in batch, all <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RenderingPhases</span> would be active. After the first mesh has been rendered, all
of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">PER_SHADER</span> should be done, so that phase can be disabled.
Disabling phases while rendering a batch of meshes results in less CPU work and better rendering
performance.</p>

<p>To take advantage of the different rendering phases, the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiShaderSortProcessor.htm">NiShaderSortProcessor</a></span> class has been
introduced. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShaderSortProcessor</span> buckets all render objects
by their active shader. Additionally, all objects in a bucket are sorted by their <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDynamicEffectState</span>. The entire bucket of meshes is then passed to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader::RenderMeshes()</span>. The default <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> implementation for all shader-based platforms has been updated to
take advantage of this by actively disabling <span class="NDLSystemFont">RenderingPhases</span>
when possible. The combination of these changes helps to improve rendering performance by batching
objects together and reducing the amount of state changes that are required per object. The
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShaderSortProcessor</span> is now the default <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderListProcessor.htm">NiRenderListProcessor</a></span> for
applications that are based on <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiApplication/NiApplication.htm">NiApplication</a></span>.</p>

<p>Note that the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShaderSortProcessor</span> will change the rendering
order of opaque objects. Scene graphs will no longer be rendered in depth first search order. The
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShaderSortProcessor</span> still sorts alpha blended objects in
back-to-front order and respects the render ordering of objects located under an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiSortAdjustNode.htm">NiSortAdjustNode</a></span>.
Applications making use of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShaderSortProcessor</span> may notice
rendering artifacts if they were relying on objects being rendered in scene graph order. To
addresses the issues, place any opaque objects that need to be rendered in an explicit order under
an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSortAdjustNode</span>.</p>

<a name="MemTrackerChanges" id="MemTrackerChanges"></a><h2>Changes in the default behavior of memory tracking</h2>

<p>Release and Release DLL configurations no longer include memory related metrics (for memory
leaks and memory summary statistics), as specified by enabling <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../GetStart/PC/Gamebryo_Build_Configurations.htm">memory tracking</a></span> as a compile-time
feature. However, Debug and Debug DLL configurations still include such memory related metrics and
will cause Memory-Leaks.xml and Memory-Overview.xml reports to be created.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, per-allocation memory logging has been disabled by default in Debug builds. As a
result, sections other than "Summary" in Memory-Overview.xml are usually empty. Per-allocation
memory logging can be re-enabled (which will fill in the empty sections in Memory-Overview.xml),
but keep in mind that it has a significant performance impact, especially on consoles.</p>

<p>See <a href=
"../../Programmer/General_Topics/Custom_Allocation.htm#MemoryTrackingAndDebugging">Memory Tracking
and Debugging</a> for details on enabling per-allocation memory logging.</p>

<a name="CustomAssertHandler" id="CustomAssertHandler"></a><h2>Changes to how a custom assert handler is implemented</h2>

<p>The signature for an assert handler has changed from:</p>
<pre>
bool Handler(<br>
    const char* pcExpression,<br>
    const char* pcFile,<br>
    const char* pcFunction,<br>
    const int iLine)<br>
</pre>

<p>to:</p>
<pre>
efd::SInt8 Handler(<br>
    const char* pcFile,<br>
    int line,<br>
    const char* pcFunction,<br>
    const char* pcPred,<br>
    const char* pcMsg,<br>
    const char* pcStack,<br>
    bool isAVerify)  <br>
</pre>

<p>Additionally, assert handlers are now registered via <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__AssertHelper.htm">efd::AssertHelper</a>::SetAssertHandler()</span>

</p><a name="CustomFileIO" id="CustomFileIO"></a><h2>Changes in how custom file I/O is implemented</h2>

<p>The constructor for <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiSystem/NiFile.htm">NiFile</a></span> (<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__File.htm">efd::File</a></span>) is now private, and all explicit uses of
the constructor have been replaced with a call to <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetFile()</span>.
This eliminates the need for special code to override the file I/O in some libraries.</p>

<a name="ShaderDirectories" id="ShaderDirectories"></a><h2>Changes in how shader directories are searched</h2>

<p>If you have shader directories that rely on recursion, note that the default behavior has
changed in Gamebryo LightSpeed. LightSpeed does not rely on recursion to search shader directories
by default.</p>

<p>As part of the directory structure reorganization for Gamebryo LightSpeed, shader folders that
formerly were maintained separately by platform in the SDK directory have been consolidated. These
folders have been relocated to the Media folder to enable more sharing of identical NSF and FX
files.</p>

<p>In addition, while Win32 and Xbox360 implementations have often been included in the same NSF
shaders traditionally, PS3 implementations typically have remained in separate (though identically
named) NSF files. This arbitrary segregation is merely a result of how the files were authored
originally, and there is no necessary reason for such segregation. Long term, such NSF files (for
example, Colorize.NSF) will likely be merged into common NSF files for Win32, Xbox360, and PS3.</p>

<p>Regardless, with the reorganization and consolidation of shader directories in the Media folder,
LightSpeed no longer searches shader directory locations recursively by default, because both the
PS3 and the Win32/Xbox360 version of an identically named NSF (e.g., Colorize.NSF) may be found at
different locations in a directory structure. The option of searching recursively remains, but that
search option is no longer the default.</p>

<p>The changes throughout the Gamebryo LightSpeed codebase have consisted of changing calls to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShaderFactory::LoadAndRunParserLibrary()</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShaderFactory::LoadAndRegisterShaderLibrary()</span>. Specifically, the last
argument, which specifies whether to rely on recursion to find shaders and shader programs, has
been changed from true to false.</p>

<a name="ThreadNames" id="ThreadNames"></a><h2>Thread names</h2>

<p>Setting the debugger name for a thread is now done through <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__Thread.htm">efd::Thread::Create()</a></span>, instead of by calling
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SetName()</span>. As a result, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetName()</span> is now protected.</p>

<p>A typical change is from:</p>
<pre>
    NiThread* pkThread = NiThread::Create(threadProc);
   pkThread-&gt;SetName("MyThread");
</pre>

<p>to:</p>
<pre>
    NiThread* pkThread =<br>
        NiThread::Create(threadProc, NiThread::USEDEF_STACK_SIZE, "MyThread");<br>
</pre>

<a name="SceneDesignerConvert" id="SceneDesignerConvert"></a><h2>Scene Designer to World Builder Conversion Notes</h2>

<p>The conversion path from Gamebryo Scene Designer (.gsa, .pal) to Gamebryo World Builder (.gsl,
.block, .emtproj, .preset) is a complex process. The differences in the underlying entity and
modeling systems are fairly radical. Clear mappings between the two systems are not always present
and generally require a case-by-case analysis. If you need to convert Scene Designer files to World
Builder and need guidance, contact Emergent support via our <a href=
"https://pulse.emergent.net/support/" target="_blank">Online Support System and Knowledge
Base</a>.</p>

<p>For those developers who have committed to using the Scene Designer system and are not ready to
switch to World Builder, or for those developers who want to use the Scene Designer tool to aid in
the conversion process, access to that tool is still available.</p>

<p>If possible, switching to <a href="../../Tools/WorldBuilder/wb_intro.htm">World Builder</a>
should be considered. World Builder provides access to all of the rapid iteration features that
come out of the box with Gamebryo LightSpeed. For a discussion of the differences between the tools
and when to use each one, see Level Editing Options: Choosing Between
World Builder and Scene Designer.</p>

<a name="PhysXConvert" id="PhysXConvert"></a><h2>Gamebryo-PhysX Conversion Notes</h2>

<p>PhysX functionality that is global in nature, such as SDK management and type conversion, has
been moved from the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/Introduction_to_NiPhysX_Class_Reference.htm">NiPhysX</a> library to the
<a href="../../Reference/efdPhysX/Introduction_to_efdPhysX_Class_Reference.htm">efdPhysX</a>
library. See the <a href="../Announce/Foundation_PhysX.htm">Foundation PhysX</a> conversion page
for detailed conversion information. Existing applications may continue to use the classes in the
NiPhysX library, but new applications should move to the new classes.</p>

<p>PhysX-based particle systems have seen some API changes to reflect changes in the underlying
NiParticle classes. See <a href="Converting_PhysX_Particles_Lightspeed.htm">Converting PhysX
Particles for LightSpeed</a> for details.</p>

<a name="STLPort" id="STLPort"></a><h2>Usage of STLPort</h2>

<p>A modified version of STLPort is used in Foundation and the Game Framework. This version is
suitably wrapped so that it will not interfere with the use of a platform vendor STL library (the
version of STL provided with any of the supported compilers). However, it is not possible to use
the Emergent-modified STLPort along with another version or copy of STLPort; this combination is
not supported.</p>

            <div class="NDLNote">
                The data structures of one STL library are not compatible with another library. For
                example, this means that you cannot use a <span class=
                "NDLSystemFont">std::vector&lt;T&gt;::iterator</span> to iterate over a
