<h1>StencilShadow Demo Code Overview</h1>

<p>The following sections detail the low-level code that creates the effect
described above. Each important member function is described:</p>

<h2>StencilShadow Constructor</h2>

<p>The constructor is similar to most other <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSample</span>-based demos, with the addition of a call to
request the creation of a stencil buffer in the renderer (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetStencil(true)</span>).</p>

<h2>Terminate</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Terminate</span> releases the three smart
pointers it has (the current interaction object, the shadow sub-tree and the
shadow shaft material) and then calls the base class <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Terminate</span> function.</p>

<h2>CreateScene</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span> creates the scene graph as
follows:</p>

<ol style="list-style: decimal; list-style-type: decimal;" type="1">
    <li>Creates the scene graph root and attaches properties to enable
    lighting.</li>

    <li>Calls <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateRoom</span> to create the room
    objects and attaches them to the scene.</li>

    <li>Loads the helicopter from a NIF file.</li>

    <li>Scales the model and translates it into position.</li>

    <li>Calls <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateShadowVolume</span> and
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateShadowOverlay</span> to add the shadow
    elements.</li>
</ol>

<h2>CreateRoom</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateRoom</span> creates a two-walled room with
a floor, adding texture coordinates. These walls will later provide a good
backdrop for receiving cast shadows. No extra work or properties are required
for the walls and floor for the shadow system. The entire scene may be drawn
normally, with NiApplication handling the rendering of the main scene graph and
the shadow volume (both or which are children of the root scene node, added in
order to ensure that the scene gets rendered prior to the shadow volume) and
the screen-space overlaid "dark" polygon that actually renders the shadow
effect.</p>

<h2>CreateShadowVolume</h2>

<p>This function creates the three elements of the shadow effect. Only one is
actually needed for the shadow effect, but the others accentuate the effect.
The necessary element is created first&mdash;a closed, double-sided object that
represents the volume swept out by the shadow. The object is made double-sided
by doubling the connectivity list and flipping the triangles in the second
copy. The object has properties attached that cause it to be zbuffered and to
increment the stencil buffer when it is visible. The object is alpha blended,
and a class-member material property is added to allow the alpha value to be
changed to make the shadow volume visible or not.</p>

<p>Next, a visible caster polygon (the one that appears to cast the shadow) is
created. It is made opaque and bluish-white. It has somewhat special stencil
behavior&mdash;wherever it is drawn, it clears the stencil buffer. This ensures
that the shadow caster is never drawn in shadow.</p>

<p>Finally, a light is created and set to point down the perpendicular to the
polygon, so that the walls and scene are lit from the same direction as the
shadow is cast. All of the elements are attached to a common parent
(<span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spShadow</span>), so that they may be moved as a
unit.</p>

<h2>CreateShadowOverlay</h2>

<p>This function creates a screen-space rectangle (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMeshScreenElements</span> ) that covers the entire screen. It
is alpha blended using <span class="NDLSystemFont">(0, SRCCOLOR)</span> mode,
which will cause the polygon to modulate the underlying scene. Properties are
attached to make the polygon a flat, dark color. The stencil buffer is drawn
only when the low-order bit of the stencil buffer is 1 (i.e. the stencil buffer
is odd). The rectangle is attached to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span>'s array of screen elements objects for
automatic rendering after the main scene is drawn.</p>

<p>It should be noted that a similar polygon could be used to make the effect
create a volumetric light by using a gray screen-space rectangle and an alpha
blending mode of (1, 1). This will cause objects in the "shadow" volume to
appear "washed-out".</p>

<h2>CreateUIElements</h2>

<p>This <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSample</span> inherited function is
overridden so that a new UI element may be added.</p>

<h2>CreateNavigationControllers</h2>

<p>This <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSample</span> inherited function is
overridden so that a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiUserInterface/NiNavFlyController.htm">NiNavFlyController</a></span>
may be added which will control the shadow caster's location and
orientation.</p>
