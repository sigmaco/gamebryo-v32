<h1>How the VideoTexture Demo Works</h1>

<p>The main application code for this demo (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VideoTexture</span>, subclassed from <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span>) is fairly straightforward,
while the bulk of the detailed interactions with the video
decoding and sound output libraries appears in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVideoDecoder_Bink</span> class, which is
derived from the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVideoDecoder</span> class.</p>

<h2>NiBinkVideo</h2>

<p>To build this sample, you'll need the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiBinkVideo.lib</span> library. You can build
this library by using the appropriate solution within the
platform-specific directories in the following location:</p>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Source\CoreRuntime\UtilityLibs\NiVisualTracker</span></p>

<p>The NiBinkVideo library in turn depends on the Bink SDK,
(available from RAD Game Tools). Before building the NiBinkVideo
library ensure the correct platform specfic environment variable
that points to the location of the Bink SDK for that platform is
setup. These include BINK_WIN32_PATH, BINK_XENON_PATH,
and BINK_PS3_PATH. In the same
way that NiMilesAudio inherits from NiAudio, the NiBinkVideo
class inherits from the NiVideo class. This creates a layer of
abstraction between Gamebryo and third party video decoding
libraries. To enable sound output for Win32 you'll also need the
Miles SDK (also available from RAD Game Tools). However,
configurations may be built that do not have sound enabled, which
applies also to platforms for which the Miles SDK is not yet
available.</p>

<h2>Initialize</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">VideoTexture::Initialize</span>
calls <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VideoTexture::CreateSoundSystem</span> to
initialize the sound library and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VideoTexture::AssociateSoundSystemWithVideoSystem</span>
to identify the sound library to the video decoding library. Then
it calls the base class version of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Initialize</span> and sets up the camera
turret.</p>

<h2>CreateScene</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">VideoTexture::CreateScene</span>
calls the base class version. Next, it creates a two-sided 3D
rectangle (with a placeholder texture) and attaches it to a node
for managing local rotations. It then positions the 3D rectangle
in the scene, based on the camera location and viewing direction.
Then, it creates a small 2D screen polygon with a placeholder
texture. Finally, it sets up a dynamic texture (i.e., the "video
texture") for use by both the two-sided 3D rectangle and the
small 2D screen rectangle.</p>

<h2>SetupVideoTexture</h2>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VideoTexture::SetupVideoTexture</span> calls
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVideoDecoder_Bink::Create</span> to
allocate and return a video decoder that specifically uses the
Bink video SDK. Then, it gets the "video texture" (actually, a
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDynamicTexture.htm">NiDynamicTexture</a></span>)
from the decoder via <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateVideoTexture</span>. Finally, it applies
the "video texture" to both sides of the two-sided 3D rectangle
and to the 2D screen rectangle.</p>

<h2>UpdateFrame</h2>

<p>After calling the base class version, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VideoTexture::UpdateFrame</span> asks the decoder
for an updated video frame by calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ProcessVideoFrame</span>. Then, it rotates the
large 3D polygon, based on the particular angular setting for
this frame (which may result from automatic spinning or user
input). Finally, the camera turret is updated, as a result of any
user input.</p>

<h2>CreateTwoSided3DPolygon</h2>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VideoTexture::CreateTwoSided3DPolygon</span>
creates a polygon with a 4 x 3 aspect ratio, as a two-sided
rectangle consisting of 4 triangles. It also assigns and updates
an appropriate texturing property.</p>

<h2>CreateScreenPolygon</h2>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VideoTexture::CreateScreenPolygon</span> creates
a small 2D screen rectangle with a 4 x 3 aspect ration near the
lower right corner of the screen. It also assigns appropriate
texturing and other properties and performs the appropriate
updates.</p>

<h2>CreateSoundSystem</h2>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VideoTexture::CreateSoundSystem</span> is called
to initialize the sound library on sound-enabled builds on
platforms that currently have sound support.</p>

<h2>AssociateSoundSystemWithVideoSystem</h2>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VideoTexture::AssociateSoundSystemWithVideoSystem</span>
directs the video decoding library (Bink, in this case) to use a
specific audio library (the Miles Sound System, for Win32) as its
sound output system.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVideoDecoder</span> base
class (which derives from <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRefObject</span>) defines numerous functions
for representative functionality across video SDKs. Some of the
base class functions do nothing or default to an error state, and
are meant to be overridden by specific video SDK subclass
implementations.</p>

<p>The class <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVideoDecoder_Bink</span> (which derives from
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVideoDecoder</span>) uses the Bink
video SDK specifically as its video decoding system. Only a few
functions are needed for the VideoTexture sample. The most
important of these are discussed below:</p>

<h2>Create</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVideoDecoder_Bink::Create</span>
allocates and returns a video decoder that specifically uses the
Bink SDK.</p>

<h2>OpenBinkFile</h2>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVideoDecoder_Bink::OpenBinkFile</span> opens
the specified Bink file for video decompression and holds onto
the Bink handle. It also preloads the entire animation into
memory for performance. Furthermore, it directs Bink to skip
frames if the video begins to fall behind the audio, which is
useful when you want the video quality to have precedence over
the sound quality. Finally, it sets the total number of frames
and initializes the status to a ready state.</p>

<h2>CreateVideoTexture</h2>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVideoDecoder_Bink::CreateVideoTexture</span>
creates a dynamic texture (for use as a "video texture") and
tries to get a format that matches the video source format for
top speed.</p>

<h2>ProcessVideoFrame</h2>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVideoDecoder_Bink::ProcessVideoFrame</span>
represents the bulk of the implementation of video frame playback
as a texture. First, it directs Bink to ensure that the rendered
frame will be 'synced' to the video frame rate. Then it
decompresses a frame of video. Next, it locks the dynamic
texture's buffer (so the decompressed frame may be copied into
it), copies the decompressed video frame into the dynamic
texture's buffer, and unlocks the dynamic texture's buffer. Then,
it advances to the next video frame in the Bink video clip, even
if the last processed frame was skipped. Finally, it adjusts the
current frame count if the video loops.</p>
