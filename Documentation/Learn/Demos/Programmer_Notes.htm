<h1>Programmer Notes</h1>

<p>Refer to the artist notes for an understanding of how
collision is setup through the art pipeline. You should also read
the <a href=
"../../Art/Max/Collision_Detection_and_3ds_Max.htm">Collision
Detection and 3ds Max</a> section for an understanding of
<a href="../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">
ABV</a>s with regards to collision. The rest of this section will
deal mostly with programming and performance considerations.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>The number of frames between collision calls is set by default
to 16, though a real-world application would probably use a delta
time metric rather than a frame count to determine when
collisions should be found.</p>

<h3>Wireframes: Flash-ABVs</h3>

<p>The wireframes for selection, for displaying ABV, and for
displaying Proxies, were all generated on export using the
Gamebryo 3ds max Plug-in. The wireframes were attached to the
parent nodes of the objects they represent. Flash-ABVs are the
wireframe representations that are drawn while collisions
occur.</p>

<p>On first implementation of this sample, it was noted that when
a large number of collisions were occurring at the same time, the
determination of what Flash-ABVs to display became costly, as
well as the actual collision calls. In an effort to keep this
cost down, a hash table (<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTMap.htm">NiTMap</a></span>) of records
containing the Flash-ABV WireRecs and their current states was
created. An array of currently displayed Flash-ABVs was used by
the Update call to display the Flash-ABV's after a call to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">FindCollisions</span>. When the
wireframe is to be displayed, the application simply sets the
objects <span class="NDLSystemFont">AppCull</span> status to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">false</span> and its <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SelectiveUpdate</span> status to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">true</span>. The Flash-ABV state in the hash
table was updated by the collision callback function, and if this
state change causes the Update function's Flash-ABV array to
become invalid, a dirty flag is set, causing the Update function
to rebuild the array.</p>

<p>Despite the extra work involved with maintaining the hash
table, this careful selection of data structures resulted in a
2:1 performance improvement while running collision testing every
frame, with the soldiers fully colliding with each other.</p>

<h3>Updates</h3>

<p>There are some additional design decisions that were made to
improve performance. Calls to the various <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> functions are also made as
infrequently as possible, and are made on small branches, where
feasible (if there are enough calls to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span>, it is more efficient to call it on
a main ancestor-node).</p>

<h3>NiCollisionGroup Improvements</h3>

<p>The soldier on the right of the scene is added to the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/NiCollisionGroup.htm">NiCollisionGroup</a></span>
object as a collider, since the user is able to move that
character through the scene. However, the other soldier is added
as a collidee, since it does not move through the scene. Since
the stationary soldier (a collidee) is animating, we still must
call <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update()</span> on it, but the
collision testing is more efficient because of this
segregation.</p>

<p>For example, most of the collidees do not need to be updated.
Second, the collidees are not tested against each other, which
reduces the total number of collision tests significantly,
especially since most applications have a large number of
collidees and a small number of colliders in the scene at any
time.</p>

<p>For specific examples of some of the dramatic performance
gains that are possible using these grouping mechanisms, see also
the information on <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Collision_Groups.htm">Collision
Groups</a>.</p>
