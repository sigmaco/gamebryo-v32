<h1>GlowEffect</h1>

<p>This is a complex effect that implements the flared light
effect found in nVidia's current Cg Browser. It makes use of the
same Cg vertex shader program code, but uses an NSF file to get
the shaders into Gamebryo.</p>

<p>This effect requires a number of different steps. First, the
scene is rendered to a texture, with the alpha channel of the
texture used to modulate the scene as a whole. Since the
brightness of each element in the scene is stored in the
texture's alpha channel, this gives a reasonable approximation of
the light contributes in the scene. Next, a screen space polygon
is drawn in a number of passes using the rendered texture and a
set of vertex and pixel shaders that blur the texture both
horizontally and vertically. The resulting blurred image is then
drawn on a screen space polygon over the scene that has been
rendered normally, and the result is an image whose glowing
elements appear to be flaring out over adjacent parts of the
scene.</p>

<p>Because the same geometry must be rendered twice, once with
shaders and once without, the demo uses an advanced
culling/rendering technique. The same <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_View.htm">
render view</a> object is used for two different <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Click.htm">
render clicks</a>. The actual culling operation is only performed
for the first render click, with a cached array of potentially
visible geometry being used for the second click. An <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiMaterialSwapProcessor.htm">NiMaterialSwapProcessor</a></span>
is used to assist in one of these renderings. It swaps out the
material on each object rendered with the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GlowElements</span> shader, renders the object,
and then restores its original material. This is a very easy
method of overriding all the materials in a list of visible
geometry with a different shader.</p>

<p>In order to render screen-space elements with shaders
attached, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">GlowEffect</span> makes
use of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiScreenFillingRenderView.htm">NiScreenFillingRenderView</a></span>
objects. These objects contain a single, screen-filling quad to
which shaders and other properties can be attached.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Blur</span> shader uses a
number of passes to perform its work, each pass requiring a
different set of constants to do its work. Gamebryo does not
easily support changing the values of constants between passes,
so the NSF file makes clever use of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CM_OPERATOR</span> constant map entry to make
this possible. The difficulty Gamebryo has is that the variable
name in a shader must match the attribute name in the NSF file.
The NSF format assumes that the data in the attributes will be
constant across all passes, so it is not easy to change values
between passes, but since the variable names in the shader
program code doesn't change between passes, the same attributes
must be used in all passes. In this case, there were eight such
variables whose values changed between passes: <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">T0_Offset</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">T1_Offset</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">T2_Offset</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">T3_Offset</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Weight0</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Weight1</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Weight2</span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Weight3</span>. The trick is to first create an
separate global attribute for each possible value. In this case,
with seven passes, seven attributes were created for each
variable, named [<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VarName</span>][<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">N</span>], where <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VarName</span> is one of the eight variable
names, and <span class="NDLSystemFont">N</span> is a digit from 0
to 6. Each of these global attributes is loaded with the correct
data for that variable and pass number. Then it is just a matter
of using the data from the global attribute named [<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VarName</span>][<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">N</span>] with the variable <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VarName</span> in pass <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">N</span>. This was done by creating eight
Operator attributes, each with the name of one of the variables.
Each operator <span class="NDLSystemFont">VarName</span> would
add [<span class="NDLSystemFont">VarName</span>][<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">N</span>] to a global constant <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Zero</span> during pass <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">N</span>, essentially copying the data for that
pass straight into the correct variable.</p>

<p>As with all other effects, this class relies on a static
instance of a dummy helper class to create an instance of a
<span class="NDLSystemFont">GlowEffect</span>. This allows the
effect to handle its own creation and initialization without any
need to change the code for the default application or any other
effects.</p>

<h2>Init</h2>

<p>During initialization, the first thing to happen is the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"ShaderEffect.htm">ShaderEffect</a>::Init</span> function gets
called, so the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RegisterShaderLibrary</span> will get a chance to
load the shader library. Then, the NIF containing the entire
scene is loaded. Since the effect requires rendering the scene
with shaders and without, no shaders have been attached to the
scene in the art package.</p>

<p>After the scene and the camera are updated, the two rendered
textures that will be used in this effect are generated. Then,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateScreenFillingRenderViews</span>
is called to create the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiScreenFillingRenderView.htm">NiScreenFillingRenderView</a></span>
objects that will be used to perform the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Blur</span> effect. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiMaterialSwapProcessor.htm">NiMaterialSwapProcessor</a></span>
is created and initialized with the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GlowElements</span> shader, and then <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateGaussianBlur</span> is called to calculate
the constants that will be used to perform the blurring
computations. Then the presence of the blur shader is tested to
determine whether the shaders were loaded correctly.</p>

<p>This function adds several <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Click.htm">
render clicks</a> to the <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Step.htm">
render step</a> created by <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderEffect::Init</span>. The first render click
uses the main scene render view and the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMaterialSwapProcessor</span> to render the main
scene to a texture using the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GlowElements</span> shader. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GlowElements</span> shader renders through the
fixed-function pipeline but modulates the texture color by the
texture alpha before writing the pixels. Since the alpha
component of the texture indicates how brightly the texel is
glowing, this gives a good first approximation of the light
flare. The next two render clicks use that texture to apply
Gaussian blur filters in the horizontal and vertical directions.
These use the same <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiScreenFillingRenderView</span> object, but
callbacks are used to swap the texture on that screen quad
between the render clicks. The main scene is then rendered to the
backbuffer as normal. Finally, the glow overlay texture is
rendered with additive alpha blending via another <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiScreenFillingRenderView</span> to make it
appear that the object is glowing. All of these render clicks are
added in the order described to the render step to be
automatically executed by the <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Introduction_to_the_Frame_Rendering_System.htm">
frame rendering system</a> during rendering.</p>

<h2>CreateScreenFillingRenderViews</h2>

<p>This function creates the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiScreenFillingRenderView.htm">NiScreenFillingRenderView</a></span>
objects that will be used to generate the blur effect and to
apply it to the normally rendered scene. The render view objects
are also set up with the rendering properties they will need.</p>

<h2>CreateGaussianBlur</h2>

<p>Calculates the texture offsets and weights that are used to
implement the Gaussian blur.</p>

<h2>Shutdown</h2>

<p>The default shutdown function <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderEffect::Shutdown</span> is called, and the
effect clears out its remaining data.</p>

<h2>Enable</h2>

<p>Before calling the default enabling function <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderEffect::Enable</span>, the effect updates
the camera parameters to values appropriate for the scene.</p>

<h2>SetBlurConstants</h2>

<p>Sets the Gaussian blur texture offsets and weights in the
global constants that are used in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Blur</span> shader. This function will set up the
constants to perform either horizontal or vertical blurring.</p>
