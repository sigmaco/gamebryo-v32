<h1>Picking Code Overview</h1>

<h2>Initialize</h2>

<p>This method initializes the parent class and then calls the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateNiPick</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateShaderPicking</span> functions.</p>

<h2>UpdateFrame</h2>

<p>This method calls the parent class <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateFrame</span> function as well as updating
the scene graph with the current time.</p>

<h2>CreateScene</h2>

<p>This method loads the scene from disk and finds the first
camera in the scene. Additionally, this method creates the
geometry that will be used to indicate the picked triangle as
well as the rendering properties that will be used to adjust how
the selected objects are rendered. It also creates an
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/Ni3DRenderView.htm">Ni3DRenderView</a></span>
object that will be used to draw the selected objects. This
<a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_View.htm">
render view</a> will be added to the <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Frame.htm">
render frame</a> in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateFrame</span> function.</p>

<h2>CreateFrame</h2>

<p>This function first calls the parent class <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateFrame</span> function to create a <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Frame.htm">
render frame</a> that renders the main scene and all screen-space
elements using the Gamebryo <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Introduction_to_the_Frame_Rendering_System.htm">
frame rendering system</a>. It then creates a <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Click.htm">
render click</a> that uses the render view created in
CreateScene. This render click will be used to draw selected
objects to the screen. A new <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"PropertySwapProcessor.htm">PropertySwapProcessor</a></span> is
created and added to the render click that uses the property list
created in <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span> to swap
out the property state on all selected objects when it renders
them. This render click is inserted into the render frame
immediately after the main scene render click.</p>

<h2>Terminate</h2>

<p>This method deletes all of the scene graph and picking data
structures used by this demo.</p>

<h2>CreateCamera</h2>

<p>This method does nothing since the camera is found in the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span> method.</p>

<h2>CreateNiPick</h2>

<p>This method creates an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/NiPick.htm">NiPick</a></span> object
and initializes it to find the triangle intersection point of the
closest triangle to the pick ray origin. Please see the class
reference for <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/NiPick.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPick</span></a> for more details on how to
configure a pick object.</p>

<h2>CreateShaderPicking</h2>

<p>This method creates a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"ColorPicker.htm">ColorPicker</a></span> with the dimensions of
the back buffer. Please see the <a href=
"ColorPicker.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ColorPicker</span></a> reference for more
details.</p>

<h2>PickPress</h2>

<p>This method uses the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PickObjects_ShaderObjectPick</span> function to
perform a shader pick from the center position of the screen. If
an object was picked, it sets the translation of the smoke effect
to be at the location of that object and culls the object, making
it disappear.</p>

<h2>PickHeld</h2>

<p>This method uses the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PickObjects_NiPick</span> function to perform an
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPick</span> pick from the center
position of the screen.</p>

<h2>PickObjects_NiPick</h2>

<p>This method converts the cursor position into a ray in world
space using the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiCamera.htm#Point_Mapping_Functions"><span class="NDLSystemFont">
NiCamera::WindowPointToRay</span></a> method. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPick::PickObjects</span> method is called on
the pick ray. Note that the scene graph was already set in the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateNiPick</span> method. The
application then searches over the returned pick records. Since
picking will only search the bind-pose positions of skinned
objects, we reject skinned geometry from our search. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FindPickableObject</span> is called on the pick
result to see if the artist annotated the object or one of its
parents as a pickable object for this demo. If it was found to be
pickable, we duplicate the triangle that was intersected into
another piece of geometry. This is done to visually display the
picked triangle.</p>

<h2>PickObjects_ShaderObjectPick</h2>

<p>This method first clamps the picking to a fixed time step.
This is done to prevent picking from becoming too large of an
application bottleneck. If picking can be performed, an offscreen
render frame is initialized and the color picked is told to
render the scene graph into the offscreen buffer using the
<a href="ColorPicker.htm">StartPick</a> and <a href=
"ColorPicker.htm">RecursivePickRender</a> methods. The picked
object is returned as a result of the <a href=
"ColorPicker.htm">EndPick</a> method. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FindPickableObject</span> is called on the pick
result to see if the artist annotated the object or one of its
parents as a pickable object for this demo. Since the shader
picking method cannot return the picked triangle, this method
does not update the picked triangle geometry.</p>

<h2>FindPickableObject</h2>

<p>This method traverses up the hierarchy looking for a piece of
<a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiBooleanExtraData.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiBooleanExtraData</span></a> named "target" on
an object in the scene graph. If this extra data is found and the
value of the data is true, the object can be effectively picked.
If not, NULL is returned.</p>

<h2>RegisterShaderParsers</h2>

<p>This method tells NiSample to register the NSFParserLib for
loading shader parsers.</p>

<h2>RegisterShaderLibraries</h2>

<p>This method tells NiSample to register the NSBShaderLib for
loading shaders. It also register the
CreateNiBinaryShaderCallback function of this demo when creating
NiBinaryShaders.</p>

<h2>CreateNiBinaryShaderCallback</h2>

<p>This method will create an instance of the <a href=
"ObjectPickBinaryShader.htm">ObjectPickBinaryShader</a> on
request from the shader factory.</p>
