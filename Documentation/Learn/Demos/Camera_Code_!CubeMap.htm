<h1>Camera Code</h1>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CubeMapCamera</span> object is
derived from <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderStep.htm">NiRenderStep</a></span>
so that it can easily be used in the Gamebryo <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Introduction_to_the_Frame_Rendering_System.htm">
frame rendering system</a>. As such, it does the bulk of its work
in its <span class="NDLSystemFont">PerformRendering</span>
function.</p>

<h2>Create</h2>

<p>This function sets all of the values that will be needed to
render the cube map faces later:</p>

<p><b>How to render:</b> A camera is created and set to a
90-degree (total) field of view, which is the correct field of
view for a cube map face (as an entire 360 degree circle will be
covered by four cube faces).</p>

<p><b>What to render to:</b> The given renderer and rendered cube
map object are used as the target. The given renderer and the
given rendered cube map are stored for later use</p>

<p><b>What to render:</b> The given scene graph object is cached
for later culling and rendering.</p>

<p><b>Where to render from:</b> The given scene graph reference
object is saved, so that its world transform may be queried later
as the camera position.</p>

<p><b>How often to render:</b> The number of cube faces that
should be rendered per frame is stored. A full redraw of the cube
map would require six renderings per frame, but this is often too
expensive in practice, so applications may choose to re-render
only a subset each frame. Rendering more cube faces per frame
will result in each rendered cube face being more up-to-date, but
can lower application performance.</p>

<p>An array of render target groups is also created. One render
target group per cube face is created. These will be used later
when rendering the cube faces.</p>

<h2>PerformRendering</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">PerformRendering</span> is the
most important function in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CubeMapCamera</span> class. It is called each
frame by the frame rendering system to update some subset of the
cube faces in an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderedCubeMap.htm">NiRenderedCubeMap</a></span>.
It handles positioning and aiming a camera that represents the
particular cube face, as well as culling and rendering the cube
map scene from the view of that camera. The class keeps track of
the last cube map face that was rendered, so that if the number
of cube faces rendered in a frame is fewer than the entire cube
map, the function will resume where it left off in the previous
call, to ensure that the most out-of-date faces are always the
next to be rendered.</p>

<p>Outside of the loop, the function sets the left-right swap on
the renderer, as cube map faces are left-handed as viewed from
the center of the cube map (i.e. the camera location). It also
moves the camera so that it is centered about the reference
object.</p>

<p>For each face that is to be rendered in a given call, the
camera is rotated to face the correct direction and up vector for
that cube face (assuming that the cube map is in world space) and
is updated. Then, the current cube face is set in the cube map
and the render target group that represents that cube face is
opened as the current render target (clearing in the process).
Finally, the scene is culled and the face is rendered using
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDrawSceneUtility.htm">NiDrawScene</a></span>.</p>

<p>After all faces are rendered, the renderer is set back to
normal right-handed rendering and the main screen is set as the
render target.</p>

<h2>Get/SetCamerasPerUpdate</h2>

<p>Retrieves and sets the number of cube faces that a call to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">RenderFaces</span> will update. The
minimum number of faces to render is one per frame, and rendering
six per frame will result in the entire cube map being rendered
each frame.</p>
