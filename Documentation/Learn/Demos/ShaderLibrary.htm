<h1>ShaderLibrary Code</h1>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderLibrary</span> library contains all of
the derived <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/NiD3DShader.htm">NiD3DShader</a></span> classes
(and additionally on Win32, all the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiD3D10Renderer/NiD3D10Shader.htm">NiD3D10Shader</a></span>
classes) that are used in the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"LibraryEffect.htm">LibraryEffect</a></span> effect, and has all the code
needed to be able to use the shader library from within the Gamebryo art tools.
The code that provides the shader library functionality is described in this
section. The associated project includes configurations for the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderLibrary</span> to be utilized as either a static library
or as a DLL.</p>

<p>There are a few files that are required when creating a shader library. Such
files include:</p>

<h2>ShaderLibraryLibType.h</h2>

<p>This file simply defines the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SHADERLIBRARYLIB_ENTRY</span> define which allows for proper
linkage for all configurations. Note that the name is specific to this library
- you will want to adjust the define accordingly when developing your own
shader libraries.</p>

<h2>ShaderLibraryLib</h2>

<p>This file can be considered the public interface to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderLibrary</span>.</p>

<p>The implementation of <span class="NDLSystemFont">DLLMain</span> is included
in this file. Nothing important is done in this function, it is just included
to debug when the library gets attached and detached from a process.</p>

<p>The interface that <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShaderFactory::LoadAndRegisterShaderLibrary</span> uses to
load and register shader libraries in defined in this file as well. The
function <span class="NDLSystemFont">LoadShaderLibrary</span> is quite simple.
It simply creates an instance of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderLibrary</span> class, sets its renderer pointer to the
given one and returns the instance.</p>

<h2>ShaderLibraryLibSDM</h2>

<p>This file implements the static data management for the shader library. The
header file uses the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDeclareSDM</span> macro to
create the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderLibraryLibSDM</span> class. The
source file provides the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Init</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Shutdown</span> functions. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Init</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">Shutdown</span>
functions currently register and unregister the library creation callback for
the ShaderLibrary.</p>

<p>For more information on the static data management system, please refer to
<a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiStaticDataManager.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiStaticDataManager</span></a>.</p>

<h2>ShaderLibrary</h2>

<p>This class is the main component of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderLibrary</span> shader library, besides the shader files.
The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/NiD3DShaderLibrary.htm">NiD3DShaderLibrary</a></span>-derived
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderLibrary</span> class is defined here. The
interface to the class is not complex.</p>

<h3>Create</h3>

<p>This function simply creates an instance of the class and returns the
pointer to it. If a derived library required additional processing, this would
be the place to perform it.</p>

<h3>Shutdown</h3>

<p>This function calls on the shaders to release their static <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiShaderDesc.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShaderDesc</span></a> objects before the library shuts
down.</p>

<h3>GetLibrary</h3>

<p>This function returns NULL, and should never be called.</p>

<h3>GetShader</h3>

<p>This function will create an instance of the requested shader and return it.
It the name of the shader requested is not one of the shaders the library
contains, it will return 0.</p>

<h3>GetShaderLibraryDesc</h3>

<p>This function will first check to see if the internal pointer to the
description already exists. If it does not, then the description is created.
The pointer to it is then returned. The description is used by the tool-chain
to determine information about the shader library, including descriptions, a
list of the shaders it supplies, and version information.</p>

<h2>ShaderLibraryD3D10</h2>

<p>This class is another main component of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderLibrary</span> shader library on Win32 platforms where
Direct3D 10 is used. The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiD3D10Renderer/NiD3D10ShaderLibrary.htm">NiD3D10ShaderLibrary</a></span>-derived
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderLibraryD3D10</span> class is defined here.
The interface for the class is not complex and is equivalent to that of the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderLibrary</span> class.</p>

<h2>ShaderLibraryD3D11</h2>

<p>This class is another main component of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderLibrary</span> shader library on Win32 platforms where
Direct3D 11 is used. The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/ecrD3D11Renderer/ecr__D3D11ShaderLibrary.htm">ecr::D3D11ShaderLibrary</a></span>-derived
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderLibraryD3D11</span> class is defined here.
The interface for the class is not complex and is equivalent to that of the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderLibrary</span> class.</p>

<h2>HaloShader</h2>

<p>This class is a subclass of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/NiD3DShader.htm">NiD3DShader</a></span> and
implements a programmatic halo and toon shader for D3D-based applications.</p>

<h3>HaloShader (Constructor)</h3>

<p>Initializes some member variables to a known state. An <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/NiD3DRenderStateGroup.htm">NiD3DRenderStateGroup</a></span>
instance is then grabbed from the pool of render state groups by calling
<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiD3DRenderStateGroup::GetFreeRenderStateGroup</span>. Depth
buffering and writing is enabled and lighting is disabled by adding the
appropriate render states and their values to this group instance.</p>

<h3>Initialize</h3>

<p>The function calls the base class version of the function, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiD3DShader::Initialize</span>. It then creates the vertex
shader programs and textures used via calls to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateShader</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateTextures</span>. The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/NiD3DPass.htm">NiD3DPass</a></span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/NiD3DTextureStage.htm">NiD3DTextureStage</a></span>
instances used to achieve the effect are then created by calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateStagesAndPasses</span>.</p>

<h3>SetupGeometry</h3>

<p>If the vertex shader constant map for the shader has already been created,
the function returns the base class function results by calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiD3DShader::SetupGeometry</span> .</p>

<p>If it has not been created, an instance is generated. To set the shader
constant registers that the vertex shader program expects, the following
mappings are added to it:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The pre-defined <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldViewProjTranspose</span> is set for registers
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">c0</span>-<span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">c3.</span> This is used in the shader to transform the
    position to screen space.</li>

    <li>The pre-defined <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldTranspose</span> is
    set for registers <span class="NDLSystemFont">c11</span>-<span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">c14.</span> This is used to transform the position to world
    space.</li>

    <li>The pre-defined <span class="NDLSystemFont">InvWorldView</span> is set
    for registers <span class="NDLSystemFont">c5</span>-<span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">c8.</span> This is used to transform the normals to perform
    lighting.</li>

    <li>A constant mapping representing the directional light direction is
    added as "<span class="NDLSystemFont">Light Direction</span>", and set for
    register <span class="NDLSystemFont">c4</span> .</li>

    <li>A constant mapping of the value 0.0f, 2.0f, 1.0f, 30.0f is added as
    "<span class="NDLSystemFont">Constants</span>", and set for register
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">c9</span>.</li>

    <li>A constant mapping representing the eye position is added as
    "<span class="NDLSystemFont">Eye</span>", and set for register <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">c10</span> .</li>

    <li>A constant mapping representing the color is added as "<span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Color</span>", and set for register <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">c16</span> .</li>

    <li>A constant mapping representing the scaling factor is added as
    "<span class="NDLSystemFont">Halo</span> <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Scaling</span> ", and set for register <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">c15</span> .</li>
</ul>

<p>The function then returns the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiD3DShader::SetupGeometry</span> result.</p>

<h3>UpdatePipeline</h3>

<p>Ensures the correct values are set in the constant for the currently active
method. For the Halo effect, it also passes a modified version of the current
time into the shader as the constant "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">HaloScaling</span>". The pipeline configuration is changed
between a toon halo and a basic halo, depending on the value of the per-object
extra data item "<span class="NDLSystemFont">EnableToon</span>".</p>

<h3>DestroyRendererData</h3>

<p>Calls <span class="NDLSystemFont">DestroyRenderData</span> on the three
vertex shader program instances held by the class. Then calls the base class
function to complete the call.</p>

<h3>RecreateRendererData</h3>

<p>Calls <span class="NDLSystemFont">RecreateRenderData</span> on the three
vertex shader program instances held by the class. Then calls the base class
function to complete the call.</p>

<h3>CreateStagesAndPasses</h3>

<p>This function precreates the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/NiD3DTextureStage.htm">NiD3DTextureStage</a></span>
and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/NiD3DPass.htm">NiD3DPass</a></span> instances
which are used to accomplish the rendering effect. There is an array of passes,
one for each potential pass in the effect (base texture and the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">HALO</span> or <span class="NDLSystemFont">TOON</span> pass).
The <span class="NDLSystemFont">PresetHaloStages</span> and <span class=

"../../Reference/NiD3D10Renderer/NiD3D10RenderStateGroup.htm">NiD3D10RenderStateGroup</a></span>
instance is then allocated if one does not exist. Depth buffering and writing
is enabled by adding the appropriate render states and their values to this
group instance.</p>

<h3>Initialize()</h3>

<p>The function calls the base class version of the function, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiD3D10Shader::Initialize()</span>. It then creates the shader
used via calls to <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateShaders()</span>. The
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiD3D10Renderer/NiD3D10Pass.htm">NiD3D10Pass</a></span>
instance used to achieve the effect is then created by calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateStagesAndPasses()</span>.</p>

<h3>SetupGeometry()</h3>

<p>If the vertex shader constant map for the shader has already been created,
the function returns the base class function results by calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiD3D10Shader::SetupGeometry()</span> .</p>

<p>If it has not been created, an instance is generated. To set the shader
constant registers that the vertex shader program expects, the following
mappings are added to it:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The pre-defined <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldViewProj</span> matrix
    is used in the shader to transform the position to screen space.</li>

    <li>The pre-defined <span class="NDLSystemFont">World</span> matrix is used
    to transform the position to world space.</li>

    <li>The pre-defined <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">InvWorldViewTranspose</span> matrix is used to transform
    the normals to perform lighting.</li>

    <li>A constant mapping representing the directional light direction is
    added as "<span class="NDLSystemFont">LightDirection</span>".</li>

    <li>A constant mapping representing the eye position is added as
    "<span class="NDLSystemFont">Eye</span>".</li>
</ul>

<p>The function then returns the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiD3D10Shader::SetupGeometry()</span> result.</p>

<h3>UpdatePipeline()</h3>

<p>Does nothing as the required pipeline configuration was completed during
initialization. Since the pipeline is static, there is no need to perform any
action in this function.</p>

<h3>DestroyRendererData()</h3>

<p>Calls <span class="NDLSystemFont">DestroyRenderData()</span> on the vertex
shader program instance held by the class. Then call the base class function to
complete the call.</p>

<h3>RecreateRendererData()</h3>

<p>Calls <span class="NDLSystemFont">RecreateRenderData()</span> on the vertex
shader program instance held by the class. Then call the base class function to
complete the call.</p>

<h3>CreateStagesAndPasses()</h3>

<p>This function precreates the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiD3D10Renderer/NiD3D10Pass.htm">NiD3D10Pass</a></span>
instance which is used to accomplish the rendering effect. There is a single
pass in this case with two texture stages.</p>

<h3>CreateShaders()</h3>

<p>This function, called from the constructor, loads the appropriate shader
program for the operating platform in by calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiD3D10ShaderProgramFactory::CreateVertexShaderFromFile()</span>.</p>

<h3>GetShaderDesc()</h3>

<p>Creates an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiShaderDesc.htm">NiShaderDesc</a></span> that is used
to inform the art tools about the existence and capabilities of this
shader.</p>

<h3>DestroyShaderDesc()</h3>

<p>Destroys the shader's static <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiShaderDesc.htm">NiShaderDesc</a></span>.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="ShaderSample_Platform_Considerations.htm">Platform
