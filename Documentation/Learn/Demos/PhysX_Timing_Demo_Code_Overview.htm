<h1>PhysX Timing Demo Code Overview</h1>

<p>This section details the functionality of the most significant
member functions in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PhysXTiming</span> class that implements this
demo. Most of the functions in this class are for toggling the
various settings available from the menu options. While they
provide useful examples of how to set these parameters, we do not
go into details here. This demo also uses a version of the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMenu</span> system.</p>

<h2>PhysXTiming::CreateScene</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span> is possibly the
simplest form for a function that loads a PhysX-enabled NIF file
and instantiates some PhysX from it. The NIF file in this case
was created in Max. We enable one optimization by looping over
all of the destinations in the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXProp.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXProp</span></a> object and enable sleep
optimization. This prevents updating of the scene graph when the
actor is sleeping, which is safe provided no parent of the actor
in the scene graph in moving.</p>

<h2>PhysXTiming::UpdateFrame</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateFrame</span> is designed to
support both synchronous and asynchronous simulation from the
same loop. The most important consideration in its design is the
PhysX requirement that almost all PhysX SDK function calls happen
outside the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">simulate/fetchResults</span> pair. In this case,
all application-level SDK calls originate from the on-screen menu
system. Hence, for each case, synchronous and asynchronous, we
provide an opportunity to do a pre-input update and a post-input
update. The pre-input update must make certain that we are
outside of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">simulate/fetchResults</span> by the time the
function returns, so that we know it is safe to use the menuing
system.</p>

<p>This function also implements a brief pause in simulation
after reset. This is an alternative to a time step limiter to
prevent very large time steps being passed to the physics on the
first application frame.</p>

<h2>PhysXTiming::UpdatePreInputSync</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdatePreInputSync</span> does
nothing. Because we are in synchronous simulation mode, there is
no simulation going on outside of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateFrame</span> function and we know we are
not inside a <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">simulate/fetchResults</span> block.</p>

<h2>PhysXTiming::UpdatePostInputSync</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdatePostInputSync</span>
performs the synchronous physics update. The only thing of
interest is that it optionally does the scene graph update before
or after the PhysX update. We place this code in the post-input
function because we want it to execute if the input system
changed the simulation to synchronous during this frame.</p>

<h2>PhysXTiming::UpdatePreInputAsync</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdatePreInputAsync</span>
performs the first part of an asynchronous update, which means
calling <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#simulation_functions">NiPhysXScene::FetchResults</a></span>
and then updating the destinations (pushing state from PhysX to
Gamebryo). If we are doing the scene graph update after the
physics, we do it now. Note also that we update <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">m_fSimTime</span> now, when the simulation has
actually run to that time.</p>

<h2>PhysXTiming::UpdatePostInputAsync</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdatePostInputAsync</span> gets
the next asynchronous simulation step started. We set the target
simulation time according to the last frame step, update the
scene graph if needed, update sources, and call simulate. This
simulation step will go on while the rendering is happening.</p>

<h2>PhysXTiming::ToggleSynchronous()</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">ToggleSynchronous</span>
function switches between synchronous simulation (physics is
executed, then rendering) and asynchronous simulation (physics
and rendering occur in parallel). It is very important to keep
the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span>
object appraised of the simulation update style, via the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#simulation_functions">NiPhysXScene::SetAsynchronousSimulation</a></span>
function.</p>
