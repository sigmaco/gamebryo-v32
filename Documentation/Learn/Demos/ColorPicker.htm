<h1>ColorPicker</h1>

<p>The most significant portion of this sample is in the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ColorPicker</span> class, which uses
the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"ObjectPickMaterial.htm">ObjectPickMaterial</a></span> object to
render the a subset of the scene to a texture, and then reads
that texture to determine which object rendered the center-most
pixel.</p>

<h3>ColorPicker (Constructor)</h3>

<p>After initializing itself with the input parameters and
storing a pointer to the D3D device, this function registers a
callback function so it can be notified when the device is lost
on Windows. This will give the class a chance to grab a reference
to the new rendered texture surface after the device is reset.
Once the callback is registered, the function goes on to call
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateRenderTarget</span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CreatePropertyAndEffectStates</span>,
and <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateMaterial</span> to prepare
the object for picking.</p>

<h3>StartPick</h3>

<p>This function begins the picking process. It first resets the
unique color that will be used to render the first object to 0.
When that is done, it calculates a new frustum for the camera -
one that is designed to render a narrow frustum that is centered
around the picked point on the screen. The new frustum retains
the other camera settings, so that the view rendered for picking
is a subset of the original view, rather than a different view
(which would cause erroneous picking). This view will render a
small square centered on the picking ray, with the same essential
proportions as the camera originally had. Then, the function
calls <span class="NDLSystemFont">ResetColorObjectMap</span> to
clear out the database of color/object relationships, and then
opens the rendered texture for geometry rendering, clearing it in
the process. Finally, the new camera data is passed down to the
renderer so drawing can begin..</p>

<h3>RecursivePickRender</h3>

<p>This function takes the scene graph it was called with and
recurses through it, storing each leaf geometry objects it
encounters in one of two lists: one for skinned objects, and one
for nonskinned objects. Note that no objects are actually
rendered at this point, in spite of the name of this
function.</p>

<h3>EndPick</h3>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">EndPick</span> takes the lists
that were generated in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RecursivePickRender</span> and performs the
actual rendering operations. It renders each object, replacing
the object's material, property state, and effect state with the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ObjectPickMaterial</span> and a
different set of properties and effects, after storing references
to the currently active material and states. After this is done,
the function replaces the original active material and states on
the geometry meshes.</p>

<p>When the rendering is all done, the renderer's render target
is closed to allow low-level rendering to complete, and the
function retrieves the rendered texture from the video hardware.
The method for doing this depends on the platform the application
is running on. Once the 16x16 render target is read back into
system memory, the function reads the color of the center texel,
which represents the screen space location of the cursor. This
result is passed into <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetPickData</span>, which returns a the geometry
information for that color (if any). A pointer to the picked mesh
is returned, and the camera's frustum is restored to its original
values before the function returns that stored pointer.</p>

<h3>CreateRenderTarget</h3>

<p>This function creates a rendered texture and render target
group that will be used in the picking process. It also creates a
second data buffer in system memory that the rendered texture
will be copied into during <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">EndPick</span>.</p>

<h3>CreatePropertyAndEffectStates</h3>

<p>This function sets up the property states and dynamic effects
that will be used in the rendering process. The properties are
simple enough: an <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiZBufferProperty.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiZBufferProperty</span></a> to ensure the object
closest to the camera is the one to get picked, and an empty
(i.e. untextured) <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturingProperty.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTexturingProperty</span></a> to let the object
ID color come through unscathed. The set of dynamic effects is
left empty.</p>

<h3>CreateMaterial</h3>

<p>This function creates and initializes the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ObjectPickMaterial</span> that is used to assist
in the picking operation.</p>

<h3>ResetNotificationFunction</h3>

<p>This callback function was the one registered with the
renderer for use when the device is reset. It simply calls the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">HandleReset</span> function.</p>

<h3>HandleReset</h3>

<p>This function refreshes the pointer to the rendered texture
that was stored during <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateRenderTarget</span>. During a device reset,
the D3D texture that rendered textures use needs to be released
and recreated.</p>

<h3>GetPickData</h3>

<p>This function is responsible for looking up the geometry
object from the color that's passed in. Because the value in the
alpha channel may be different depending on the hardware, the
alpha channel is first masked out, and then used to look up the
geometry from the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTMap.htm">NiTMap</a></span>. If no
match is found, this function returns <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NULL</span>.</p>

<h3>DetermineNextAvailableColor</h3>

<p>This simple function just increments the counter that stores
the current object's color and returns the new color.</p>

<h3>ResetColorObjectMap</h3>

<p>This function is called after the pick has completed: it
empties the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTMap.htm">NiTMap</a></span> that stores
the color-geometry relationship.</p>

<h3>FreeObjectPickData</h3>

<p>This function simply calls <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ResetColorObjectMap</span> in preparation for
shutdown.</p>

<h3>GetColorForObject</h3>

<p>This function, called by the various shaders during the
rendering process, is responsible for assigning new unique colors
to objects and recording which colors get associated with which
geometry. It first calls <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">DetermineNextAvailableColor</span> to get the new
color, then it adds the color and geometry object to the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTMap.htm">NiTMap</a></span>.</p>
