<h1>PhysX Timing Demo Functional Overview</h1>

<p>The interesting aspects of this demo are, of course, the
update structure. By adjusting the menu setting, you can see the
artifacts that arise due to various loop structures. The effects
are more obvious than normal if you limit the "frame rate" of the
PhysX or the application frame rate.</p>

<h2>Two Timelines</h2>

<p>When thinking about update timing and the various artifacts
that arise, it is simplest to consider Gamebryo and PhysX as
moving along parallel time tracks. Gamebryo's time is advanced by
a call to <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> on the scene
graph, which moves the state of the system from the previous time
to the time given as the argument to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span>. PhysX time is advanced by a call
to <span class="NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span> that returns
true (i.e. the fetch happened), which advances the available
PhysX state to the time given in the preceding <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Simulate</span> call.</p>

<p>Things are not quite so simple, because the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span>
class, if fixed step timing is enabled, forces the PhysX
<span class="NDLSystemFont">simulate</span> calls to use times
that fall at fixed intervals. The time that was used for the most
recent <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#simulation_functions">NiPhysXScene::FetchResults</a></span>
is available with <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#simulation_functions">NiPhysXScene::GetPrevFetchTime</a></span>.</p>

<p>The update functions in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#update_functions_for_sources_and_destinations">
NiPhysXScene</a></span> class, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateSources</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateDestinations</span>, move state from the
Gamebryo time-line to the PhysX time-line, and vice versa. When
these functions are called, they either use state from the latest
time that a time-line is in, or they interpolate between the two
latest states.</p>

<h2>Scene Graph Second Simulation</h2>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/Limited_PhysX.jpg" width="515" height="400"
    alt="Limited_PhysX (64K)">
	    <p class="FigureCaption">PhysX Timing demo: Limit PhysX
    rate</p>
</div>

<p>When you limit the PhysX frame rate, the first thing you might
notice is that the debug geometry for the paddle lags behind the
rendered geometry, as shown in the image above. In this loop
structure, we <span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateSources</span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Simulate</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateDestinations</span> and then <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> the scene graph. The lag in debug
geometry indicates that PhysX thinks that the paddle is farther
back in time than the rendering does. This is expected because
<span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateSources</span> is called before
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> on the scene graph, and
hence is pushing the previous frame's paddle state to PhysX. By
the time the scene is rendered, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> has been called and the actual
paddle geometry is farther forward in time.</p>

<h2>Scene Graph First Simulation</h2>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/Update_pre_PhysX.jpg" width="515" height=
    "400" alt="Update_pre_PhysX (57K)">
	    <p class="FigureCaption">PhysX Timing demo: Update scene
    graph before calling <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">UpdateSources</span></p>
</div>

<p>One way to more closely match the PhysX motion to the rendered
geometry is to update the scene graph before calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateSources</span>. But now, the ball debug
geometry and renderings do not match. This is because the call to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateDestinations</span> is setting
a transformation in the scene graph, but with no <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> before rendering that
transformation is not correctly applied to the ball geometry.</p>

<p>If it is possible to completely partition the scene graph
between sources (kinematic actors) and destinations (dynamic
actors), you might be able to reduce artifacts by updating the
kinematic actors before the simulate call, and then the dynamic
actors after.</p>

<h2>Interpolation</h2>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/Limited_PhysX_with_Interp.jpg" width="515"
    height="400" alt="Limited_PhysX_with_Interp (61K)">
	    <p class="FigureCaption">PhysX Timing demo: Interpolation</p>
</div>

<p>Interpolation can be used to smooth out the PhysX motion when
the PhysX frame rate is lower than the rendering frame rate. This
does not reduce artifacts due to timing mismatches, but it does
make the rendered motion appear somewhat smoother.</p>

<h2>Asynchronous Simulation</h2>

<p>Asynchronous simulation has about the same effect as doing a
scene graph update before simulation is called. If you un-roll an
asynchronous loop, you will see that it looks quite like a Scene
Graph First Simulation. The rendering is now happening before the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span>, but in Scene
Graph First Simulation the ordering of rendering and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span> does not matter because the
state from <span class="NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span> was
not being updated to the scene graph before rendering.</p>

<h2>Extrapolating</h2>

<p>Extrapolation in this context means predicting what will
happen in the future. Other Gamebryo-PhysX demo use extrapolation
with asynchronous simulation to make it behave like Scene Graph
Second timing. To extrapolate, pass a future time to the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Simulate</span> call. Specifically,
guess what the next frame time will be and use that. If working
with near-constant frame rates, this can be a very effective
strategy.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are many timing variants possible, and this demo has not
explored all of them. Experiment, making use of debug geometry to
estimate the artifacts your simulation produces. Note, however,
that in an interactive environment you cannot achieve perfect
synchronization of PhysX with gameplay because it takes time to
compute PhysX and you cannot know what the player will do while
that computation is proceeding.</p>
