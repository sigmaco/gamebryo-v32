<h1>How the MeshInstancing Demo Works</h1>

<p>The following sections describe how the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MeshInstancing</span> sample uses Gamebryo's
support for hardware instancing to render thousands of gears on
screen. The methods and code are detailed function-by-function in
the MeshInstancing Demo Code Overview section.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The sample loads <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">recursive_gearing.nif</span> which contains 5
separate non-instanced gear meshes. These gears are then
instanced and placed the scene graph is such a way so that gear
group exist inside of other gear groups. Creating a recursive
gear fractal of sorts.</p>

<h2>Hardware Instancing</h2>

<p>Pressing the '<span class="NDLSystemFont">Hardware
Instancing</span>' checkbox will toggle on and off the use of
hardware instancing. When a large number of gears are being
rendered users should notice a significant performance drop when
turning off use of hardware instancing. This performance drop
comes from the increased CPU work required by Gamebryo to render
each gear individually. With hardware instancing enabled if both
animation and dynamic bounds are disabled the application will
become completely GPU bound.</p>

<h2>Animation</h2>

<p>Pressing the '<span class="NDLSystemFont">Animation'</span>
checkbox will cycle execution of the gear rotations. A single
recursive gear system can have a rather deep and complex scene
graph. Multiply this complexity by thousands of gear systems and
the resulting scene graph can become quite large. Calculating the
animations for the scene requires recursing through the entire
scene graph and performing calculations on each gear. This can be
a rather time consuming process and should be something to keep
in mind when creating large instanced scenes. Support for
hardware instancing allows the renderer to quickly draw large
numbers of objects, but it does not change the amount of time
required to update / animate them. Turning off animation of the
scene allows users to see how update time of a large scene is
related to total frame time.</p>

<h2>Dynamic Bounds</h2>

<p>Pressing the '<span class="NDLSystemFont">Dynamic
Bounds'</span> checkbox will toggle support for updating the
scene graph bounds every frame. Computing the bounding volumes
for a scene graph requires recursing to the leaf nodes of the
scene graph and then bubbling data back up to the root node. This
can be time consuming on a on reasonable sized scene graphs,
performing this process on a huge scene graph with thousands of
nodes is significantly worse. Due to the time consuming nature of
updating bounding volumes instanced meshes have the option of
turning off bounds updates on instanced nodes. This can be very
useful considering most cases of instancing are performed on
static geometry. Toggling support for dynamic bounds allows the
user to see the performance affects on the update time and total
frame time. It should be noted that enabling dynamic bounds will
only impact performance if the scene graph is being updated /
changed.</p>

<h2>Gear Systems &amp; Gears Per System</h2>

<p>Adjusting the '<span class="NDLSystemFont">Gear
Systems</span>' and '<span class="NDLSystemFont">Gears Per
System</span>' sliders allow the user to control how many gears
will be rendered. Adjusting the '<span class="NDLSystemFont">Gear
Systems</span>' slider changes the total number of main gear
cylinders. Each new gear system will be created behind the
previous one. A maximum of 10 gear systems can be rendered.
Adjusting the '<span class="NDLSystemFont">Gears Per
System</span>' slider changes the number of gears inside of each
gear system. New gears are added inside of larger gears in the
system. A gear system can have a maximum of 500 gears.</p>

<h2>Per Instance Culling</h2>

<p>Gamebryo's hardware instancing support allows for instanced
objects to be culled in two possible manners. The first and most
CPU efficient method is to treat all the instances of a mesh as a
single unit. A single bounding volume will be used to encapsulate
all of the instances, if any portion of this bounding volume is
visible all of the instances will be rendered. Only when the
entire bounding volume is out of view will the instances actually
be culled. This is of course also the most GPU expensive
method.</p>

<p>The other option, which is the most GPU efficient method, is
to cull each instance individually. As one would expected
performing culling on thousands of objects can be a rather CPU
intensive task. To help mitigate this cost per a instance culling
mesh modifier is used. Performing the culling by a mesh modifier
allows for the process of culling thousands of objects to be
split across multiple threads via Floodgate. The MeshInstancing
demo makes use of per instance culling. The benefits of this can
be scene in the demo when by adjusting the camera so some of the
gears are outside of the camera's field of view.</p>
