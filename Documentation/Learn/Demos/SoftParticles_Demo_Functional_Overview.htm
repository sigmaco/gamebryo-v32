<h1>SoftParticles Demo Functional Overview</h1>

<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>

<p>The problem that soft particles are trying to solve is the
hard intersections that occur when particle billboards intersect
with scene geometry. This demo contains a graphical effect
designed to smooth out that intersection. Below is a side view of
a billboarded particle intersecting with the scene.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/softparticles_diagram.png" width="580"
    height="313" alt="softparticles_diagram (24K)"> 
    <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
</div>

<p>In the normal rendering pipeline, the intersection between the
particle and the scene will be a hard line. In the diagram, this
line would be coming out of point P3. Even with depth maps on
particles that modify its z-value, there will still be unsightly
hard lines. To eliminate this problem this effect decreases the
alpha value of the particle as the particle approaches the scene
behind it. In order to give an artist some more control over how
the effect looks, we use a user specified shader constant to
determine the distance (in world space) over which we will
modulate the particle's alpha. Any particles that are farther
away from the scene than that distance will not have their alpha
modified.</p>

<p>In the diagram, consider point <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">P1</span> to be at this distance. The points from
<span class="NDLSystemFont">P1</span> to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">P3</span> will be increasingly alpha blended. The
smaller the distance that is specified, the more similar to hard
particles the effect will seem. However, if very a large distance
is specified relative to the world size, then the particle system
can seem very sparse as the soft particle effect will fade the
particles out more frequently.</p>

<p>This method of softening particle edges is an approximation.
The approximation fails when the normals of the scene start to
become perpendicular to the camera's direction. In this
situation, the particle is actually quite close to the
intersecting surface but reports a large depth value since the
camera vector is nearly tangent to the intersecting surface. In
addition, because the particle only checks parallel to the camera
direction for its distance to the scene, it has no other
knowledge of the rest of the scene that surrounds it in other
directions.</p>

<h2>Application-side Setup</h2>

<p>The rendering of the soft particles requires the camera-space
depth values of the rest of the scene. The soft particles need to
be rendered after the scene. One method of storing the depth is
to store it in destination alpha of the default render target.
Another method is just to store the additional information in
another render target, which is the approach that this demo
takes.</p>

<p>In this demo, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SoftParticlesManager</span> object handles the
deferred rendering of the particle system. When the application
is initialized, the particle systems are added to the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SoftParticlesManager</span>, and set
to be application culled. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SoftParticlesManager</span> object is itself a
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderClick.htm">NiRenderClick</a></span>
object and is manually inserted after the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderClick.htm">NiRenderClick</a></span>
object for the main scene. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SoftParticlesManager</span> object creates an
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSParticleSystem.htm">NiPSParticleSystem</a></span>
object to hold all of the particles that have been added.</p>

<p>The default material of the scene is set to use the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">MRT_ColorDepthMaterial</span> class.
This class derives from <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiStandardMaterial</span>. In addition to the
standard material behavior, it also writes out the camera-space
z-value (i.e. non-projected depth value) to an additional render
target. The additional render target gets created during the
application initialization and added to the render target group
that the main scene renders into. If this demo had any additional
custom shaders, they would have to be modified to write out to
the additional render target as well.</p>

<h2>Modifying NiStandardMaterial</h2>

<p>This class has three different materials that derive from
standard material. The motivation for using standard material is
to gain all of the benefits of flexible shaders that can handle
skinned vs. non-skinned objects with different kinds of lighting
and textures. Deriving from it allows the application to be able
to inject some custom functionality without losing any of that
per-object and cross-platform flexibility. See the <a href=
"SoftParticles_demo_Code_Overview.htm">code overview</a> for more
details about each of these materials.</p>
