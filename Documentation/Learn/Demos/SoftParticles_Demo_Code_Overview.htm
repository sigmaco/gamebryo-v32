<h1>SoftParticles Demo Code Overview</h1>

<p>This section details the functionality of significant 
 member functions in the four classes that form the application: <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">SoftParticles</span> (the demo itself), <span class="NDLSystemFont">MRT_ColorDepthMaterial</span> 
 (the material for the scene), <span class="NDLSystemFOnt">SoftParticlesMaterial</span> 
 (the material for the soft particles), and <span class="NDLSystemFont">SoftParticlesManager</span> 
 (the class that handles the deferred rendering of the particle systems).</p>

<h2>SoftParticles::CreateScene</h2>

<p>This function loads the scene. It adds any particle 
 systems found within the scene file into the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SoftParticlesManager</span> 
 object for handling. It uses the first camera it can find it the scene 
 file and, if one is not provided, it creates a default one. It initializes 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SoftParticlesManager</span> object. Finally, 
 it also sets the default material for the scene to be and <span class="NDLSystemFont">MRT_ColorDepthMaterial</span> 
 object so that by default the scene has its depth rendered into an additional 
 buffer.</p>

<h2>SoftParticles::CreateFrame</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">The CreateFrame</span> function 
 performs the bulk of the application-specific work for the soft particles. 
 This function creates an additional render target that contains a single 
 floating point value per pixel to store the camera-space depth in. It 
 then creates a new render target group that contains the default render 
 target group's contents and this additional buffer.</p>

<p>Additional information about the Xbox 360 version of the code can be found <a href="../../ee_goto.htm#Learn/Demos/SoftParticles_Demo_Code_Xbox360.htm">here</a></p>

<h2>SoftParticlesManager::Initialize</h2>

<p>This function sets up the initial camera, culler, and 
 material that will be applied to particle systems that are added. This 
 class needs to be initialized before particle systems can be added.</p>

<h2>SoftParticlesManager::RecursiveFindAndAddSoftParticles</h2>

<p>This function recursively finds all soft particles within 
 a given scene graph and adds them to the manager for processing.</p>

<h2>SoftParticlesManager::AddParticles</h2>

<p>Once the manager has been initialized, then particle 
 systems can be added to this manager. This is done in the main application 
 via <span class="NDLSystemFont">SoftParticlesManager::RecursiveFindAndAddSoftParticles</span>, 
 which is described above. Adding a particle system sets the particle system 
 in the scene graph to be app culled (so it doesn't draw, but is still 
 updated appropriately).</p>

<h2>SoftParticlesManager::InitializeScene</h2>

<p>Once all the particle systems have been added, this 
 function should be called. It creates the geometry that particle systems 
 will be packed into. This manager does all the quad generation for the 
 particle systems itself and this function sets up all the initial geometry 
 to make that happen. Because the number and size of the geometry is dependent 
 upon the particle systems that have been added, it is separate from the 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">AddParticles</span> function and should be called 
 only once.</p>

<h2>SoftParticlesManager::Update</h2>

<p>This function set the particle depth.</p>

<h3>MRT_ColorBlackMaterial class</h3>

<p>This is the material used to clear the screen with. 
 This would be unneeded in applications that render to the entire screen 
 or use destination alpha to store depth instead of an additional render 
 target. On certain platforms (PS3), it is an error to not have a color 
 output for each buffer in a render target group. On all platforms, it 
 is impossible to clear one buffer of a render target group to one color 
 and another buffer to a different one. The render target group for the 
 non-particles part of the scene has both the default backbuffer and a 
 buffer to store the scene depth. The default backbuffer needs to be cleared 
 to the renderer's clear color, but the texture for depth needs to be cleared 
 to zero. Zero is a special case for the depth texture to detect unwritten 
 pixels. This material is designed to solve these problems.</p>

<p>This material overrides the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStandardMaterial::HandlePostLightTextureApplication</span> 
 function. This is the last function that is called in a pixel shader. 
 The class itself takes a render target group in its constructor and for 
 each extra buffer, it creates an output constant of black, adds an additional 
 color output, and ties the constant to that output.</p>

<h3>MRT_ColorDepthMaterial class</h3>

<p>This is the material that is used to render the scene 
 before the particles are rendered. This material extends both the vertex 
 and pixel shader of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStandardMaterial.htm">NiStandardMaterial</a></span> 
 . The vertex shader is overridden to pass the view position of each vertex 
 to the pixel shader as a texture coordinate. The view position resource 
 is cached during the shader creation process and added at the end of the 
 vertex shader generation pipeline in <span class="NDLSystemFont">HandleCalculateFog</span>, 
 so that it can be added as the final texture coordinate. The pixel shader 
 takes that view position passed as a texture coordinate and writes out 
 the z-value as an additional color output. This is done in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">HandlePostLightTextureApplication</span> 
 function like the above <span class="NDLSystemFont">MRT_ColorBlackMaterial</span>. 
 </p>

<h3>SoftParticlesMaterial class</h3>

<p>This material uses the depth values cleared in <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">MRT_ColorBlackMaterial</span> and written in <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">MRT_ColorDepthMaterial</span> to generate alpha values 
 for particles. In the vertex shader, it generates screen coordinates to 
 look up into the depth texture. It passes this information through a texture 
 coordinate like the above material in <span class="NDLSystemFont">HandleCalculateFog</span>. 
 It also packs the current view position's z-value into the texture coordinate 
 as well. In the pixel shader, the screen coordinates are used to look 
 up in the depth texture and are compared against the view position depth 
 to generate an alpha value. This is done in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">HandlePreLightTextureApplication</span> 
 function to modulate the accumulated opacity.</p>
