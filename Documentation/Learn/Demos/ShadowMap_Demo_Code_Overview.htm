<h1>ShadowMap Demo Code Overview</h1>

<p>The following sections detail the low-level code that creates
the shadow mapping effect. Each important member function is
described:</p>

<h2>Constructor</h2>

<p>The constructor is similar to most other <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span>-based demos. Each component
gets initialized to a sensible default.</p>

<h2>CreateScene</h2>

<p>The first thing that <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span> does is ensure that the
current hardware is capable of running this sample. It does this
by checking to see if the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiShadowManager.htm">NiShadowManager</a></span>
is active and asks the shadow manager if the hardware is capable
of running the shadowing system. If the hardware is not capable
of supporting the shadowing system a message box will be
displayed to inform the user.</p>

<p>This check does not ensure that every <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiShadowTechnique.htm">NiShadowTechnique</a></span>
is supported by the hardware, instead it simply checks to ensure
the hardware is capable of supporting SM2.0. Supporting SM2.0 is
the only directly enforced requirement by the shadowing system.
If the hardware does not support SM2.0 the shadow manager will
not be activated. If the hardware does support SM2.0 this still
does not indicate that every <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShadowTechnique</span> will work. Each
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShadowTechnique</span> has its own
set of requirements and if the hardware does not meet the
requirements for a shadow technique a shadow map will not be
created for the light that uses that <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShadowTechnique</span>.</p>

<p>Next, the actual scene construction is ready to start. First a
new <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiNode.htm">NiNode</a></span> is created
to hold the various elements of the scene and then the Scene.NIF
file is loaded. Some scene manipulation takes place to facilitate
the input-handling code that moves objects around in the scene. A
pointer to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span> that is
the parent of the room's camera is saved for later reference, and
the camera itself is saved in the main <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiApplication/Introduction_to_NiApplication.htm">
NiApplication</a></span> <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiCamera.htm">NiCamera</a></span> smart
pointer. Then a new <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span> is
inserted between the camera and its former parent node. This
extra node allows the camera to look up and down without
influencing the translation around the scene, and also provides a
place for the flashlight geometry to be attached later. The final
step in this manipulation is to take the camera's transform from
the parent of the camera's original parent node (which is
calculated from the local transforms of the camera itself and its
original parent node). This transform is redistributed in
components among the camera's original parent node, the camera's
new parent node, and the camera itself. The original parent gets
the scale, translation, and the rotation within the horizontal
place, while the vertical rotation gets put in camera's new
parent and the camera itself gets an identity transform. The
function <span class="NDLSystemFont">SeparateUpDownMatrix</span>
helps with this redistribution.</p>

<p>When this is done, the flashlight geometry is loaded from its
NIF file and prepared. Next a new node is created so the
flashlight can have a similar structure to the camera, which
allows the same input-handling code to manipulate either the
flashlight or the camera separately. This new structure is then
added to the scene. Afterwards a new shadow generator is created
and applied to the flashlight's spotlight. This informs the
shadowing system that the flashlight's spotlight should cast
shadows.</p>

<p>The final step in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span> is to iterate through all the
shadow generator objects in the scene and manually set the near
and far clipping planes. These are the values that will be used
when rendering their shadow maps. Since the sample deals with a
single static scene, valid near and far clipping plane values can
be pre-determined and used. Using pre-determined values helps to
improve the precision of the shadow maps. The shadowing system
can automatically compute valid near and far clipping plane
values, but these values will not be as tightly fitting as the
ones that are manually set.</p>

<h2>CreateFrame</h2>

<p>This function sets up the <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Frame.htm">
render frame</a> for use with the Gamebryo's <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Introduction_to_the_Frame_Rendering_System.htm">
frame rendering system</a>. It first calls <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateFrame</span> of its parent class
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiSample/NiSample.htm">NiSample</a></span> to
initially setup the main render frame.</p>

<p>Inside of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateFrame</span>
function for <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSample</span> a shadow
<a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderStep.htm">render step</a>
is created. The shadow render step then gets the function
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ShadowRenderStepPre</span> assigned
as a pre-processing call back function. Since the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShadowRenderStepPre</span> function is assigned
as a pre-processing call back function this means that function
will be called just before the shadow render step is executed.
The <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShadowRenderStepPre</span>
function retrieves the set of render click objects need to render
the shadow maps from the shadow manager and applies those render
clicks to the shadow render step. When the shadow render step is
executed the render clicks provided by the shadow manager are
rendered and the shadows for the scene are updated.</p>

<p>Next, render clicks are created/obtained for screen elements,
screen textures, and visual trackers. The main scene and
screen-space elements render clicks are all added to a main
render step.</p>

<p>The render frame is then created and the shadowing render
steps are added to it before the main render step. Finally, an
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiUserInterface/NiUIManagerRenderClick.htm">NiUIManagerRenderClick</a></span>
is created and appended in its own render step to the end of the
render frame. For Win32 builds, an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiCursor/NiCursorRenderClick.htm">NiCursorRenderClick</a></span>
is also appended to the render frame.</p>

<p>Now that the render frame has been created, the multiple
rendering passes will be completed automatically each frame by
the frame rendering system.</p>

<h2>CreateCamera</h2>

<p>Since the camera is loaded from the scene in this sample, the
derived version of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateCamera</span> does nothing.</p>

<h2>CreateVisualTrackers</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateVisualTrackers</span>
function adds some trackers that measure the time taken to cull
and render the shadow-map creation pass, and track the number of
objects visible in that pass.</p>

<h2>Initialize</h2>

<p>The Initialize method first calls Initialize for the parent
class <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiSample/NiSample.htm">NiSample</a></span>. Next, a
PSSM (Parallel Split Shadow Map) Click
Generator is created. To do this, a <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPSSMConfiguration.htm">NiPSSMConfiguration</a></span>
object is configured and used to create and register a
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPSSMShadowClickGenerator.htm">NiPSSMShadowClickGenerator</a></span>
object with the shadow manager.  Lastly, shadow map
pooling is disabled in the shadow manager to reduce GPU memory fragmentation.</p>

<h2>GetPSSMConfig</h2>

<p>This member function returns a <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPSSMConfiguration.htm">NiPSSMConfiguration</a></span>
object pointer from the shadow manager. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPSSMConfiguration.htm">NiPSSMConfiguration</a></span>
object is obtained by iterating through the shadow generators until
a generator is found that will return a non-null <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPSSMConfiguration.htm">NiPSSMConfiguration</a></span>
object pointer. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPSSMConfiguration.htm">NiPSSMConfiguration</a></span>
object describes the internal state of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPSSMShadowClickGenerator.htm">NiPSSMShadowClickGenerator</a></span>
object implementing PSSM. This configuration object is used in
the demo to manipulate the PSSM exposed features.</p>

<h2>SetPSSMEnabled</h2>

<p>This member function enables or
disables PSSM. The shadow manager is used to activate either a
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPSSMShadowClickGenerator.htm">NiPSSMShadowClickGenerator</a></span>
or a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDefaultShadowClickGenerator.htm">NiDefaultShadowClickGenerator</a></span>
object. If a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPSSMShadowClickGenerator.htm">NiPSSMShadowClickGenerator</a></span>
object is activated and a pointer to the object can be obtained
from the shadow manager then the shadow generator of the current
directional light is set active in the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPSSMShadowClickGenerator.htm">NiPSSMShadowClickGenerator</a></span>
object. After attempting to activate either of the shadow click
generators, the shadow generators are marked dirty and
RequestUpdateShadowmapPreview is called to update the preview of
the shadow map.</p>

<h2>Terminate</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Terminate</span> releases the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ShadowMap</span>'s smart pointers.
All the other smart pointers will be released during <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span>'s <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Terminate</span> call. It also unregisters the
reset notification function.</p>

<h2>UpdateFrame</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateFrame</span> calls the base
class and then updates the scene graph.</p>
