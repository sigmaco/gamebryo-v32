<h1>Overview of the Shader Picking Method</h1>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Picking</span> demo addresses
a difficult problem: how to perform an accurate pick on an object
that has been skinned in video hardware. Most picking is done on
the CPU, using copies of the vertex data stored in system memory.
For objects that are skinned using the video hardware, however,
the deformed (skinned) vertices only exist on the video hardware,
and are never accessible by the CPU. Only the "bind pose"
vertices (the base position of the skin) exist in system memory.
This fact means that if an application wants to do picking on
skinned objects, those objects will need to be skinned in
software instead of hardware or approximations like Alternate
Bounding Volumes (ABVs) must be used. Neither approach is optimal
if exact per-pixel picking is required.</p>

<h2>How The Shader Picking Method Works</h2>

<p>The solution involves the use of a class, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="ColorPicker.htm">ColorPicker</a></span>,
which makes use of a material named <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"ObjectPickMaterial.htm">ObjectPickMaterial</a></span>. That
material, in turn, manages three shaders: two based on the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"ObjectPickBinaryShader.htm">ObjectPickBinaryShader</a></span>
shader (one for skinned objects and one for unskinned objects),
which make use of SM2.0 pixel and vertex shaders, and one shader
named <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"FixedFunctionPickShader.htm">FixedFunctionPickShader</a></span>
that uses the fixed-function pipeline. All three shaders perform
the same task: render an object with standard vertex transforms,
but colored a single, flat color that's unique for that geometry
instance. This unique color can then be read back into main
memory, and used to identify which object is closest to the
camera at a given screen space pixel location.</p>

<p>This operation is equivalent to performing a pick on the scene
at that screen space pixel location, but it will correctly
represent the scene as it appears on screen, not how it is stored
in local memory. When called into action via a button click, the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"ColorPicker.htm">ColorPicker</a></span> class will render a
subsection the scene, using the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"ObjectPickMaterial.htm">ObjectPickMaterial</a></span>, to a very
small texture. The subsection that gets drawn is the 16x16 pixel
region surrounding the pixel that the pick operation is using. It
will then pull the rendered texture back into system memory,
which is not too slow because of the small texture size. The
color of the center pixel is used to look up which mesh it
belongs to, and the pointer to the picked geometry can be
returned.</p>

<p>This method can be extended to address how any object whose
vertices are manipulated by a vertex shader in hardware, though
it would require writing a version of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"ObjectPickMaterial.htm">ObjectPickMaterial</a></span> that uses
a shader whose vertex shader matches the object's standard vertex
shader, but that writes the identifying color to the frame buffer
rather than running the object's standard pixel shader. In many
cases, a simplified version of the vertex shader can be used that
performs the vertex manipulation, but removes any unneeded
calculations like normal transforms or texture coordinate
generation, since only the vertex positions and unique flat color
are required.</p>

<h2>Limitations of the Shader Pick Method</h2>

<p>The shader-based picking method is primarily used to indicate
what piece of geometry was hit when the ray was cast. It is not
possible to determine the vertex indices or triangle indices from
this picking method, unlike the <a href=
"Overview_of_the_NiPick_method.htm">NiPick</a> method.
Additionally, it is impossible to receive any other information
than what was picked. Vertex positions, normals, vertex colors,
etc are not available unless a shader is written that provides
that additional information. The provided <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="ColorPicker.htm">ColorPicker</a></span>
only supports determining the object picked. Extensions could be
written by a developer that support writing the requested vertex
data to the back-buffer using floating point render targets.</p>

<p>Note that since the geometric data on the GPU is used in the
picking process, this method can adequately reflect the results
of morphing and skinning operations.</p>
