<h1>DX9MSAATextures Demo Code Overview</h1>

<p>The following sections detail the low-level code that creates the shadow mapping effect. Each
important member function is described:</p>

<h2>Constructor</h2>

<p>The constructor is similar to most other <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span>-based
demos. Each component gets initialized to a sensible default.</p>

<h2>CreateScene</h2>

<p>At compile time, <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span> will check to see if
<span class="NDLSystemFont">_DX9</span> is defined, indicating the application is being compiled
for use with the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/NiDX9Renderer.htm">NiDX9Renderer</a></span>. If it is not, then this
function will compile to a simple message box display that indicates that the sample is not
supported on the current platform and returns <span class="NDLSystemFont">false</span>.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span> first loads in two NIF files that will be used in
this sample: one containing the room, and one containing the posing skeleton model. The two scenes
are added to the application's <span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spScene</span> node, and then the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">RecursivePrepareScene</span> function is called to patch up the scene
for this sample's purposes. When that is done, the camera is grabbed from the scene and stored in
the application's <span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spCamera</span> pointer, and the entire scene has
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateProperties</span>, and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateEffects</span> called on it.</p>

<p>Next, the rendered texture is constructed using same dimensions as the renderer's default
backbuffer. An <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderTargetGroup.htm">NiRenderTargetGroup</a></span> is then constructed
to allow rendering to that texture - note that a new depth/stencil buffer is requested for the
render target group. This is because the rendered texture will not have MSAA enabled, and the
renderer's default depth/stencil buffer might. Since the back buffer and depth/stencil buffer must
have the same MSAA parameters, the function must request a new depth/stencil buffer for the
rendered texture. Of course, if the application was going to use the intermediate render target
surface for all rendering, it would not be necessary to create this render target group at all -
this render target group is only created to allow the sample to draw directly to the rendered
texture.</p>

<p>Because the process is a little more complex, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateMSAARenderTarget</span> encapsulates the work needed to create an
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderTargetGroup.htm">NiRenderTargetGroup</a></span> that contains the
intermediate render target surface.</p>

<p>Next, the function registers a reset notification function with the renderer. This is because
the intermediate render target surface needs to be explicitly created using D3D interfaces, and
will need to be released and recreated when the D3D device is reset. The reset notification
function will take care of this eventuality. The DX9 renderer then has <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PerformPrecache</span> called on it to cause the geometry precaching to take
place.</p>

<h2>CreateCamera</h2>

<p>Since the camera is loaded from the scene in this sample, the derived version of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateCamera</span> does nothing.</p>

<h2>Terminate</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Terminate</span> releases the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">DX9MSAATexture</span> sample's smart pointers. All the other smart pointers will be
released during <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span>'s <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Terminate</span> call. It also unregisters the reset notification function.</p>

<h2>UpdateFrame</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateFrame</span> calls the base class and then updates the scene
graph.</p>

<h2>CreateFrame</h2>

<p>This function first calls the base class version to construct a <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Frame.htm">render frame</a>
for use with the Gamebryo <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Introduction_to_the_Frame_Rendering_System.htm">frame
rendering system</a>. It then creates an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiScreenFillingRenderView.htm">NiScreenFillingRenderView</a></span> object
that contains a single, screen-sized quad that will be used to render the texture to the screen. An
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturingProperty.htm">NiTexturingProperty</a></span> is created that
uses the rendered texture that was built earlier, and that texture is attached to the screen quad
via the <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_View.htm">render view</a>. A
<a href="../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Click.htm">render
click</a> is created to render the screen quad in the frame rendering system, and a pre-processing
callback function is registered with that render click to update the rendered texture before
rendering the screen quad. A pointer is obtained to the main scene render click (so that its render
target can be swapped out later, and the full-screen quad render click is added immediately after
the main scene render click to the render frame. Finally, the render target group on the main scene
render click is set to be either the MSAA render target or the regular render target, depending on
the application mode.</p>

<h2>RecursivePrepareScene</h2>

<p>This recursive function performs a number of last-minute modifications to the scene graph. The
first of these is simply to force all the time controllers to LOOP. Because of the way the skeleton
is modeled, this can't be set at export time, and in order to avoid using an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm">NiActorManager</a></span>
for such a simple set of animations, the time controllers are manually modified here.</p>

<p>The function also updates any lights in the scene to affect the entire scene - this allows the
lights in the room to affect the skeleton.</p>

<p>Before returning, <span class="NDLSystemFont">RecursiveModifyScene</span> lives up to its name
checking to see if the current object is an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span> and recursing
along all the node's children if it is.</p>

<h2>SetCurrentMode</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">SetCurrentMode</span> switches between the two rendering modes:
rendering directly to the rendered texture, and rendering to the intermediate render target buffer.
The purpose of these two modes is to visually demonstrate the MSAA that using the intermediate
render target buffer enables.</p>

<p>Besides setting the new value for the <span class="NDLSystemFont">m_bMSAATextureActive</span>
variable, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetCurrentMode</span> function updates the screen text to
reflect what mode the application is now in, and if it is using MSAA, what MSAA level is enabled.
The render target group for the main scene render click is also updated here to be either the MSAA
render target group or the regular render target group, depending on the mode setting.</p>

<h2>CreateMSAARenderTarget</h2>

<p>This function obtains a new render target surface from the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateMSAARenderTargetSurface</span> function and creates an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/NiDX9Direct3DBufferData.htm">NiDX9Direct3DBufferData</a></span>
object (as well as the associated <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/Ni2DBuffer.htm">Ni2DBuffer</a></span>) to hold that surface. It then
creates a new <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderTargetGroup</span> to allow Gamebryo to render to
that surface.</p>

<h2>UpdateRenderedTexture</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateRenderedTexture</span> function is used to transfer the
render data from the intermediate render target surface to the rendered texture. This step is only
needed when the application is making use of the intermediate surface, so if <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">m_bMSAATextureActive</span> is <span class="NDLSystemFont">false</span> then the
function does nothing. If the intermediate surface is in use, then the first step is to obtain a
pointer to the that intermediate surface. This can be done by getting the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/Ni2DBuffer.htm">Ni2DBuffer</a></span> from the
render target that uses it, grabbing the renderer data from that, casting the result to an
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/NiDX92DBufferData.htm">NiDX92DBufferData</a></span> object, and
calling <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetSurface</span> on it. When that is done, the destination D3D
surface needs to be obtained from the rendered texture that will be used to display the rendered
data. This is done by requesting the renderer data from the rendered texture, casting that to an
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/NiDX9TextureData.htm">NiDX9TextureData</a></span> object, and then
calling <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetD3DTexture</span> on it. The resulting D3D texture is used
to call <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetSurfaceLevel</span>, which returns the D3D surface for that
texture.</p>

<p>Once both the source and destination surface pointers are available, the renderer data can be
transferred from the intermediate surface to the rendered texture surface. The current renderer is
cast to an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/Introduction_to_the_DX9Renderer.htm">NiDX9Renderer</a></span> so the
application can obtain the D3D device, and then the device is used to call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">StretchRect</span>, which copies the data. While copying the data, the antialiased
intermediate surface is downsampled - this is what allows the texture to be used as usual, even
though the original data was multisampled. During this process, the multiple samples per pixel are
automatically combined into one value per texel in such a way that the resulting texture still
looks antialiased.</p>

<h2>CreateMSAARenderTargetSurface</h2>

<p>This function uses D3D functions to actually create the intermediate render target surface. This
surface needs to be the same size and format as the rendered texture, but it also needs to use the
multisampling parameters used to create the default backbuffer. So the first part of this function
is responsible for obtaining those values.</p>

<p>Getting the pixel format from the rendered texture is straightforward: simply call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetPixelFormat</span> on the rendered texture and pass the results into
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9PixelFormat::DetermineD3DFormat</span>. Getting the multisample
information is a little more complex. First, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetCreationParameters</span> is called on the DX9 renderer to get the values used
to create the renderer. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">uiFBMode</span> parameter is the one that
contains the multisampling information. The multisample type is returned from calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDX9Renderer::GetMultiSampleType</span> on that parameter. If the multisample type
is <span class="NDLSystemFont">NONMASKABLE</span>, then the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">uiFBMode</span> parameter has the appropriate bits masked out to reveal the
multisample quality.</p>

<p>Once those values have been obtained, the function can grab the D3D device and call
CreateRenderTarget on it, passing in the rendered texture's dimensions and format, and the
backbuffer's multisampling parameters. The resulting surface is then returned.</p>

<h2>ResetNotificationFunction</h2>

<p>This static function simply hands control off to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">HandleReset</span> function.</p>

<h2>HandleReset</h2>

<p>This is where the application takes care of the intermediate rendered texture in response to a
lost device. First, the function grabs a pointer to the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/NiDX9Direct3DBufferData.htm">NiDX9Direct3DBufferData</a></span> that
will be cleared out or restored.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">bBeforeReset</span> parameter tells the function whether it is
getting called before the reset or after. Before the reset, the function will call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PurgeBufferData</span> so the buffer data will release its reference to the D3D
surface.</p>

<p>After the reset, the function recreates the released render target surface with the function
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateMSAARenderTargetSurface</span>. The D3D surfaceis reapplied to
the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/NiDX9Direct3DBufferData.htm">NiDX9Direct3DBufferData</a></span> it
originally came from using <span class="NDLSystemFont">RecreateBufferData</span>.</p>
