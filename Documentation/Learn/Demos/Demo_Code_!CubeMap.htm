<h1>Demo Code</h1>

<p>The following sections describe each function in the 
 two major classes used to create the demo.</p>

<h2>UpdateFrame</h2>

<p>In addition to calling the base class version, this 
 function also updates the scene and camera. The camera code involves a 
 procedural placement of the animated camera to track the reflective sphere's 
 position only (not rotation), with offsets to frame the scene. Note, the 
 animated camera is always updated, but the camera used to render the scene 
 is under control of the navigation system. One of the navigation system's 
 controllers will track the animated camera.</p>

<h2>CreateFrame</h2>

<p>This function first calls the base class version to 
 create a default <a HREF="../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Frame.htm">render 
 frame</a> that will render the scene and all screen-space elements with 
 the Gamebryo <a HREF="../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Introduction_to_the_Frame_Rendering_System.htm">frame 
 rendering system</a>. It then adds pre- and post-processing callback functions 
 to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CubeMapCamera</span> <a HREF="../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Step.htm">render 
 step</a> and prepends it to the list of render steps in the render frame 
 so that it will generate the cube maps prior to rendering the scene. The 
 pre- and post-processing callback functions for the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CubeMapCamera</span> 
 object set <span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spSphere</span> (containing the 
 active planet) to be culled during cube map generation.</p>

<h2>RenderFrame</h2>

<p>Prior to calling 
 the base class version of the function, which will use the frame rendering 
 system to render the scene, this function sets the active state of the 
 cube map render step to enable and disable cube map generation depending 
 on user settings.</p>

<h2>Terminate</h2>

<p>Nothing out of the ordinary in this function&mdash;all allocated 
 objects are destroyed, including the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CubeMapCamera</span>.</p>

<h2>CreateScene</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span> 
 loads the mobile, finds the camera, and creates the reflective sphere 
 in <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateDynamicMultitexturedEffects</span> 
 (detailed below) to set up the cube map.</p>

<h2>CreateNavigationControllers</h2>

<p>The NiSample navigation system is augmented by adding 
 a <a href="../../Reference/NiUserInterface/NiNavInterpToController.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiNavInterpToController</span></a>. The new controller 
 is configured to track the animated camera. Finally, the navigation system 
 is updated to use the new controller by default. </p>

<h2>ToggleCubeMapSource</h2>

<p>This function switches between the source and rendered 
 cube maps by attaching the desired cube map texture to the environment 
 map effect. The rendered cube map is the reflective effect, while the 
 source cube map simply contains six faces with white borders and the &quot;name&quot; 
 of the cube face on it, and is designed to show how cube mapping works. 
 Note that the cube map is in world space in this case. Because the scene 
 was modeled in 3ds max, this &quot;up&quot; direction is shown as&nbsp;+Z.</p>

<h2>ToggleCubeMapMethod</h2>

<p>This method simply switches the environment map effect 
 between <span class="NDLSystemFont">DIFFUSE_CUBE_MAP</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">SPECULAR_CUBE_MAP</span> 
 using <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm">NiTextureEffect</a>::SetTextureCoordGen</span>. 
 This shows the (in this case subtle) difference between the two mapping 
 modes. The most obvious differences will be seen at the silhouette edges 
 of the sphere, where the reflection vector (specular mode) differs by 
 up to 90 degrees from the surface normal (diffuse mode).</p>

<h2>CreateDynamicMultitextureEffects</h2>

<p>This function creates all of the objects that are needed 
 to generate the live reflection effects. First, it creates two cube maps; 
 one that will be updated live via rendering, and one that is loaded from 
 static image files.</p>

<p>The&nbsp; <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderedCubeMap.htm">NiRenderedCubeMap</a></span> 
 object is created first&mdash;this will serve as the live reflection map. 
 The demo prints a warning to the debugging output if the rendered cube 
 map cannot be created.&nbsp; Next, for demonstration purposes, an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../../Reference/NiMain/NiSourceCubeMap.htm">NiSourceCubeMap</a></span> 
 is created. Note that <span class="NDLSystemFont">ConvertMediaFilename</span> 
 is not called six times in the creation function&mdash;because the Convert 
 function uses a single shared static string, if it is called multiple 
 times in the same function invocation, the multiple arguments will result 
 in multiple copies of the same string. So, the filenames are converted 
 one by one into individual storage.</p>

<p>The sphere shell that will be wrapped around each planet 
 is loaded from disk and is modified by applying a black base map and a 
 normal map to the texturing property. Because environment mapping is an 
 effect that is additive w.r.t. the base map, we use a black base map to 
 cause the cube map to be rendered directly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cube map is applied via an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm">NiTextureEffect</a></span>, 
 whose texture coordinate generation mode is (by default) <span class="NDLSystemFont">SPECULAR_CUBE_MAP</span> (a keystroke in the demo 
 can change this to diffuse cube mapping).&nbsp; The texture applied to 
 this effect is the rendered cube map (a keystroke in the demo can change 
 this to the source cube map).</p>

<p>The spherical shell is adjusted to fit the first planet 
 using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SelectNextPlanet</span> method.</p>

<p>Finally, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CubeMapCamera</span> 
 object is created, which will manage the rendering of the cube faces. 
 The rendered cube map is used as the target cube map; the main renderer 
 is used as the cube map rendering device; the main scene is set as the 
 scene to be rendered into the cube map, and the sphere object's center 
 is used as the cube map camera's rendering center.</p>
