<h1>PhysX Particles Demo Functional Overview</h1>

<p>The scene graph for this demo was created in a modeling package and exported using three
different process scripts, resulting in three scene files. The application loads these three NIFs
and wraps each one with a class to control its updating and appearance. At runtime, only one of
these wrappers is being updated and drawn. The interesting aspects of this demo relate to how PhysX
is updated in conjunction with the scene-graph particle system, and how PhysX content is accessed
and modified at runtime.</p>

<h2>Detecting PhysX Hardware</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">getHWVersion()</span> in the PhysX SDK object returns 0 if there
is no hardware present. This is the simplest way to check for PhysX hardware. You can also try
creating a <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene</span> object with hardware simulation parameters
and test if it fails.</p>

<h2>Changing PhysX Parameters At Runtime</h2>

<p>Due to the limited feature set of the PhysX authoring tools and the limits of Gamebryo's PhysX
support, it is frequently necessary to access or modify PhysX data after loading it from a file or
after a simulation is created. There are various was to do this, depending on what information you
are looking for and when you need it. This application uses two mechanisms: direct access to the
PhysX scene object, and access via the Gamebryo descriptor for a PhysX object.</p>

<p>When working with PhysX hardware, concave collision meshes must be explicitly paged by the
application. The PhysX Particles application includes code to page in all the meshes in a scene,
and it does so by accessing the PhysX <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene</span> object and working
directly with PhysX API calls. In general, Gamebryo-PhysX integration provides full access to the
PhysX API.</p>

<p>PhysX-based particles require a prototypical PhysX actor to represent the particle. The
information to create this actor is stored in a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXActorDesc.htm">NiPhysXActorDesc</a></span> object associated with
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXPSParticleSystem</span> or <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXPSMeshParticleSystem</span> object. A <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXActorDesc</span> object is a wrapper for a <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NxActorDesc</span> object and also contains information relating the PhysX actor to
Gamebryo objects. In this application, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXActorDesc</span>
object is accessed to disable PhysX gravity for the particles. In general, if you wish to modify
the properties of a PhysX object before creating it, then you should work through the Gamebryo
descriptors. We disable gravity because we want the particles to rise while the rigid shapes fall.
So we use PhysX gravity for the rigid shapes and a particle system gravity modifier for the
particles.</p>

<p>At runtime, this application also enables and disables PhysX debug visualization. When modifying
PhysX parameters at runtime, it is essential that all changes be made outside of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Simulate/FetchResults</span> block. PhysX Particles shows one way to ensure that
this is always the case.</p>

<h2>Resetting a PhysX Particle Simulation</h2>

<p>This application allows for simulation reset. If you wish to support this functionality, do not
delete the snapshot in a prop loaded from a NIF file, or create a snapshot using the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysXTools/NiPhysXSnapshotExtractor.htm">NiPhysXSnapshotExtractor</a></span>
class if you are creating the PhysX content in code. It is then a simple matter to restore the
state of the scene from the snapshot. Note that not everything is captured by a snapshot and
restored. See <a href="../../Programmer/NiPhysX/Snapshots_and_State_Restoration.htm">Snapshots and
State Restoration</a> for details.</p>

<h2>Updating PhysX Particles</h2>

<p>In addition to standard Gamebryo scene graph updating, an application with PhysX content must
also explicitly update the simulation. The process is not automated because there are many possible
variants on how this is done, each with different implications for performance and appearance. See
<a href="../../Programmer/NiPhysX/Basic_PhysX_Updating_Tasks.htm">Updating Gamebryo-PhysX</a> for
more details. A PhysX-based particle system includes destinations of PhysX content, so <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateDestinations</span> must be called on the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> object,
in addition to <span class="NDLSystemFont">Simulate</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span>.</p>

<p>Physical simulation can be done synchronously or asynchronously with respect to rendering. If
synchronous, the application sets up the physics computation and then waits for it to finish before
moving on. On the other hand, asynchronous simulation sets up the physics and then does other
computation while waiting for the answer. This application can take either approach, with a
noticeable performance difference (asynchronous makes more effective use of computational
resources).</p>

<h2>PhysX Debug Visualization</h2>

<p>The PhysX API supports the production of debugging geometry, useful for visualizing the system
state as the physics engine sees it. Gamebryo can process and render this geometry for you simply
by setting the appropriate flag on the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> object. Note that this can have
a major negative impact on performance, as this demo shows.</p>
