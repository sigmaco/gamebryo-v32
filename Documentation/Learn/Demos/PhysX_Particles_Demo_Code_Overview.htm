<h1>PhysX Particles Demo Code Overview</h1>

<p>This section details the functionality of significant member
functions in the two classes that form the main application:
<span class="NDLSystemFont">BubblingParticles</span> (the demo
itself), <span class="NDLSystemFont">BubblesScene</span> (the
wrapper for each sub-scene).</p>

<h2>BubblingParticles::Initialize</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Initialize</span> first creates the
PhysX SDK object via the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efdPhysX/efdPhysX__PhysXSDKManager.htm">efdPhysX::PhysXSDKManager::Initialize</a></span>
function. We must create the PhysX SDK before calling
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication::Initialize</span>
because the latter creates PhysX objects via <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span>. We also set several SDK
parameters. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">SKIN_WIDTH</span> is
set to a small value because the particle actors are small. Note
that all values specified to the SDK here are not scaled by the
factor in the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span>
object. The resulting debug geometry is scaled, however.</p>

<h2>BubblingParticles::CreateScene</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span> loads the NIF
files, creating the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">BubblesScene</span> objects in the process. It
checks for hardware before trying to load the hardware scene.</p>

<h2>BubblingParticles::UpdateFrame</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateFrame</span> first deals
with input. The frame time is capped to prevent large physics
steps. Leaving it unchanged leaves the possibility for time steps
that cause the bubbles to pass through walls or the objects to
escape their grate. PhysX sub-stepping would typically prevent
such problems, but a check like this ensures that sub-stepping
does not take too many steps.</p>

<p>If the simulation is active, then we make appropriate calls
into the <span class="NDLSystemFont">BubblesScene</span> class to
perform the update. The update is split into two steps, driven by
the need to access the PhysX SDK outside of the
Simulate/FetchResults pair. When simulating asynchronously, the
application is only outside of Simulate/FetchResults between the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span> call at the start
of the update (in <span class="NDLSystemFont">PreUpdate</span>)
and the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Simulate</span> call in
<span class="NDLSystemFont">PostUpdate</span>. At this time we
enact any operations that involve the PhysX SDK, in this case
toggling debug rendering or changing the simulation timing.</p>

<p>Finally, <span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateFrame</span>
updates the particle counter.</p>

<h2>BubblingParticles::ToggleDebugRender</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">ToggleDebugRender</span> switches
both the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span>
flags and the PhysX SDK flag. The former only controls whether
the debug geometry is rendered, while the latter controls whether
it is produced. The two flags are independent: you can produce
geometry but have Gamebryo not render it, or you can try to
render even if no geometry is produced (in which case you will
see nothing).</p>

<h2>BubblesScene::BubblesScene</h2>

<p>The constructor takes the file name for the NIF file to load
and a flag indicating that the scene be prepared for hardware. It
loads the file and assumes the first top-level object in the
stream is the scene graph. The particle system node is found in
the scene graph and the emitter is extracted. We need the emitter
in order to modify the particle emission rate at runtime.</p>

<p>The constructor then loops through the other top-level objects
using runtime type information (RTTI) to determine what kind of
objects are present. If a camera is found (one is expected) then
that becomes the local camera. If a <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXProp.htm">NiPhysXProp</a></span>
object is found then this NIF file contains PhysX content. When a
prop is found we create a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span>
object and the PhysX <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene</span>
object, using the hardware flag to determine the scene type. We
also set some flags on the scene to enable updating of sources
and destinations and to disable debug rendering (for now).</p>

<p>PhysX-based particle systems are streamed from the art tools
in a distinct <a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysXParticle/NiPhysXPSParticleSystemProp.htm">
NiPhysXPSParticleSystemProp</a> or <a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysXParticle/NiPhysXPSMeshParticleSystemProp.htm">
NiPhysXPSMeshParticleSystemProp</a> object. In this demo we check
for props of type <a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysXParticle/NiPhysXPSParticleSystemProp.htm">
NiPhysXPSParticleSystemProp</a>. If found, we know that the
particle system we have just loaded must be of type <a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysXParticle/NiPhysXPSParticleSystem.htm">NiPhysXPSParticleSystem</a>.
All such systems must contain an actor descriptor holding the
properties of the PhysX actor that represents the particles.
Before adding the prop to the scene we modify the actor
descriptor to turn off gravity on the particles. For this we need
access to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxBodyDesc</span>
object for the prototypical particle actor. We get the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXBodyDesc.htm">NiPhysXBodyDesc</a></span>
wrapper for the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxBodyDesc</span>
object and then the descriptor itself. We modify the flags on
this and then save it back into the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXBodyDesc</span> object.</p>

<p>All props are added to the scene. If particle actor pools are
enabled, this would fill the pools. We also check if we have
hardware, and if so page in the meshes.</p>

<p>The last step in the constructor is to update the scene graph
and run-up the particle systems. This ensures that the system is
already populated with bubbles when a user switches to it at
runtime.</p>

<h2>BubblesScene::RunUpPSys</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">RunUpPSys</span> is responsible
for simulating the particle system for a few seconds in order to
emit some bubbles and give the rigid shapes a chance to reach a
reasonable state, free of their initial conditions. The function
splits the given interval into sub-steps of a reasonable size (60
frames per second in this case) and then repeatedly steps the
simulation. The time at the end of the run-up is then returned.
Calling functions set the local simulation time to be this new
time.</p>

<h2>BubblesScene::PreUpdate</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">PreUpdate</span> function
performs the first part of an asynchronous update, or all of a
synchronous update. Work is only done if the scene is active, in
which case the scene graph is always updated after any physics
that is present. Before doing anything the local time is
incremented by the given increment.</p>

<p>When doing synchronous updating, this function updates the
scene graph. This calls all the particle system controllers and
begins the parallel updating that will set up the velocity change
request for each particle. We then start simulation (which forces
particle system update to complete) with the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Simulate</span> call and wait for its results
with <span class="NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span>. The last
step of physics updating is to call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateDestinations</span>, which prepares the
particle system for scene graph update. And we are done for
synchronous simulation.</p>

<p>For asynchronous simulation, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PreUpdate</span> is responsible for fetching the
results from the simulation that was started in the previous
frame. It then updates the destinations before updating the scene
graph, which runs all the particle modifiers to set up state
ready for the next simulate call. It is essential that the scene
graph update happen after <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateDestinations</span> when doing asynchronous
simulation, so that the scene graph update is working with the
most recent physics data.</p>

<h2>BubblesScene::PostUpdate</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">PreUpdate</span> function only
acts of we are active and doing asynchronous simulation. It
updates the sources and starts the next simulation loop, which
will run while Gamebryo is rendering this frame. Note that we are
passing a future time to this simulate call. It is an estimate of
the next frame time, when the results will be required and when
they will be pushed into the scene graph.</p>

<h2>BubblesScene::SimulateStart</h2>

<p>Before beginning simulation, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> needs to know what the time
is, which is done through a call to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetFetchTime</span>. We also clear any debug
geometry that might be left over from a previous simulation step.
Before starting the simulation, we update the destinations with
the force flag set (the second argument). This makes certain that
the correct time is pushed into all the sources and destinations,
even if it time has moved backwards. This should always be done
when a reset happens or when the updating of sources and
destinations has been paused for a while. Finally, we start
simulation.</p>

<h2>BubblesScene::SimulateStop</h2>

<p>After stopping the simulation the final state is pushed into
the scene graph.</p>

<h2>BubblesScene::SetSynchronous</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span>
object must be informed when the simulation changes from
synchronous to asynchronous and vice versa. The scene uses this
information to correctly set the synchronization points for
<a href=
"../../Programmer/NiMesh/Introduction_to_Mesh_Modifiers.htm">mesh
modifiers</a>.</p>

<h2>BubblesScene::Reset</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Reset</span> function stops
the simulation (if running), resets it, and restarts if
necessary. Note the use of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene::GetInSimFetch</span> to determine
if simulation is underway.</p>

<p>The reset itself first resets the Gamebryo particle system. It
then restores the PhysX scene from snapshot 0, which is
guaranteed to exist in a scene loaded from a NIF, and represents
the initial conditions with which the PhysX actors were created.
Only the positions and velocities of the actors are restored,
which is all we require here. We then run-up the system again and
restart simulation, if necessary. Note that the run-up implicitly
forces the scene graph to update in response to the reset.</p>

<h2>BubblesScene::PageMeshes</h2>

<p>This function is designed to page all the meshes for a
hardware simulation. If working with a small scene, this may be
appropriate. For larger scenes it might be necessary to be
selective about which pages are mapped and update the paging at
runtime. The function loops over all the actors in the PhysX
scene, loops over each actor's shape, and if it is a triangle
mesh, loops over its pages.</p>
