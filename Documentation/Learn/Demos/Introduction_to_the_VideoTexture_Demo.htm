<h1>Introduction to the VideoTexture Demo</h1>

<p>This sample demonstrates how to use Gamebryo dynamic textures
with a video decompression library in order to implement video
frame playback as a "video texture" on any 3D or 2D surface
within a scene. In this particular implementation, the Bink SDK
is used, along with the Miles SDK for sound output (although
sound is optional).</p>

<p>The sample displays a spinning two-sided 3D rectangle and a
small 2D screen rectangle, both of which have the same dynamic
texture applied, to which successive frames from a video clip are
copied. There are numerous keyboard and gamepad controls to
manipulate the spinning of the two-sided 3D rectangle, to
reposition the small 2D screen rectangle on the screen, and to
manipulate the camera.</p>

<p>The video clip used in the sample is of the blaster effect in
the Metal Wars full demo. The video frame size is 512 x 384, with
a color depth of 32. There's roughly 16 seconds of video at 30
frames per second. The sound is 16-bit stereo, sampled at 44.1
kHz.</p>

<p>The Gamebryo implementation for dynamic textures is designed
for optimal performance for such "write only" textures across
multiple platforms and graphics cards. The <a href=
"Introduction_!DynamicTexture.htm">DynamicTexture</a> sample
represents another example of a use for such dynamic textures, in
that case as a procedural texture.</p>

<p>The dynamic texture that this sample creates has dimensions
that are not powers of two. When running on hardware that doesn't
support non-power-of-two textures at all, the creation of this
texture will fail. This will be reported in a dialog box, and the
application will exit.</p>
