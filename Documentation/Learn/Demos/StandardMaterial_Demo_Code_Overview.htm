<h1>StandardMaterial Demo Code Overview</h1>

<p>This section details the functionality of significant member
functions in the two classes that form the application:
<span class="NDLSystemFont">StandardMaterial</span> (the demo
itself), and <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShadowObject</span> (the
shadow object).</p>

<h2>StandardMaterial::UpdateFrame</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateFrame</span> calls the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSample</span> base class instance
of the function (to update input, update frame rate stats,
etc). It updates the scene. Finally, the shadow direction is
updated to track the spotlight from the scene.</p>

<p>Updating of the scene is done with a custom accumulated time,
to allow rewind and fast-forward functionality.</p>

<h2>StandardMaterial::RenderFrame</h2>

<p>The shadow texture is rendered using <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShadowObject::ClickAndStuff</span>. Because that
system uses a custom accumulator, the application's alpha
accumulator is reapplied onto the renderer. Finally, the base
class <span class="NDLSystemFont">RenderFrame</span> function is
called to render the main, on screen scene.</p>

<h2>StandardMaterial::CreateScene</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span> creates all
aspects of the scene graph. First, it creates an <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAlphaAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAlphaAccumulator</span></a> object. Then the
scene NIF file is loaded. This scene includes a snail which has
many textures specified using <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStandardMaterial.htm">
NiStandardMaterial</a></span>. The first camera in the scene is
found to be used.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSample</span> navigation
system is augmented to allow tracking of the animated camera. To
set tracking up correctly, the animated camera is cloned so that
the free flying camera will have the same properties (FOV,
etc).</p>

<p>Finally, the shadow object is created, and configured by
setting caster and receivers.</p>

<h2>StandardMaterial::CreateNavigationControllers</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSample</span> navigation
system is augmented by adding a <a href=
"../../Reference/NiUserInterface/NiNavInterpToController.htm"><span class="NDLSystemFont">
NiNavInterpToController</span></a>. The new controller is
configured to track the animated camera. Finally, the navigation
system is updated to use the new controller by default.</p>

<h2>ShadowObject::Create</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShadowObject</span> object has
a protected constructor and a public, static <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Create</span> function so that the class can
"fail" creation if hardware support for rendering to a texture is
not present. First, the Create function generates a new
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ShadowObject</span>. Then it attempts
to create an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderedTexture.htm">NiRenderedTexture</a></span>
object. At this point, the function uses a renderer query in
order to determine the color depth of the main, onscreen
buffer. Based on the bit-depth of the backbuffer, it selects
either a 16 or 32 bit format preference object. While this is not
technically necessary, it does ensure that we do not render to a
needlessly deep rendered texture if the main framebuffer is only
16 bits. If the attempt to create a rendered texture fails, the
function returns failure.</p>

<p>A render target group is created to allow the renderer to draw
to the rendered texture. While render target groups can support
more than one simultaneous rendered texture, in this case we only
need to render to one, basic rendered texture, a color buffer
than will serve as the shadow image.</p>

<p>Finally, a parallel projected shadow texture effect is created
with the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderedTexture.htm">NiRenderedTexture</a></span>
object as the image. The effect uses bilinear filtering (since
the rendered texture is not mip-mapped), and CLAMP_S_CLAMP_T
(since the effect should not repeat) texture wrapping. No
projection is defined at this time as it will be updated
later.</p>

<h2>ShadowObject::Constructor</h2>

<p>First, the caster is set to NULL, as there is no shadow caster
by default. Then, the shadow camera is created no values are set
other than the far and near planes, which are set to distant
values, since this camera will be centered quite far from its
subject. Next, a <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MasterPropertyAccumulator</span> object is
created  an accumulator that renders the geometry registered
with it without changing the order of the objects (i.e. it does
not "sort"), applying a specified set of properties to all
rendered objects. Three properties are attached to this sorter
an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiMaterialProperty.htm">NiMaterialProperty</a></span>
object, an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiVertexColorProperty.htm">NiVertexColorProperty</a></span>
object, and an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturingProperty.htm">NiTexturingProperty</a></span>
object. All of these properties are designed to override the
properties in the object being drawn as a shadow, so that the
shadow object is drawn into the shadow map as a flat color.</p>

<h2>ShadowObject::ClickAndStuff</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">ClickAndStuff</span> does all of
the updating of the shadow image and its representations by
"clicking" the camera (i.e. drawing the shadow caster). It
returns without doing any work if the caster geometry, renderer,
or rendered texture is null. It sets the background color to
white and updates the camera's position, orientation and field of
view using <span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateShadowCamera</span>.
It "opens" the rendered texture as the rendering target and then
sets the default accumulator (the one attached to the renderer)
to be the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MasterPropertyAccumulator</span>. Using the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDrawScene</span> convenience
function for both steps, it culls the caster scene from the point
of view of the camera representing the light and then renders the
resulting geometry with the accumulator.  It then "closes" the
current render target, effectively drawing the shadow to the
rendered texture. Finally, it calls <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateProjection</span> to update the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span> representing
the projection of the shadow into the scene.</p>

<h2>ShadowObject::SetCaster</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">SetCaster</span> caches the caster
scene graph in a local member pointer. This scene graph comprises
the objects that cast shadows. Note that if objects in this scene
graph are sparse (i.e. two characters separated by a large
distance), then the resolution of the shadow will be poor, as
most of the texture will consist of the unshadowed area between
the objects. This method works best when there is a single,
compact caster.</p>

<h2>ShadowObject::UpdateShadowCamera</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateShadowCamera</span> adjusts
the camera to aim at the target. The camera is translated so that
it is 5000 world units away from the center of the shadow
caster's world bounding sphere along the user-specified light
direction vector. Then, an "up" vector for the camera is computed
to be perpendicular to the direction vector. This up vector and
the caster's center are used as the argument to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LookAtWorldPoint</span>. Then, a field of view
value is computed such that the camera frustum edges will tightly
enclose the caster's bounding sphere. These values are set for
the frustum of the camera and the camera is updated.</p>

<h2>ShadowObject::UpdateProjection</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateProjection</span> updates
the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm">NiTextureEffect</a></span>
object that will be used to project the shadow texture out into
the scene. It computes an orthographic parallel projection matrix
that uses a view plane normal that is equal to the shadow light
direction. The view reference point along the ray from the center
of the caster's bounding sphere in the view plane normal
direction, and the left/right/top/bottom values are set to make
the sides of the view volume exactly fit the bounding sphere plus
5% on each side.</p>

<p>These values are simple to compute, as the shadow camera
already defines useful "up" and "right" vectors for such a
projection, and the camera center is on the desired ray.</p>
