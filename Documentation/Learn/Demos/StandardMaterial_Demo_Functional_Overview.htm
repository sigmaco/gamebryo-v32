<h1>StandardMaterial Demo Functional Overview</h1>

<h2>Basic concepts</h2>

<p>A NIF file containing the simple landscape, snail, and snail
house is loaded and supplies the scene graph of this demo. An
animated camera, and lights, are also provided. They track the
snail using a look at controller.</p>

<p>The <a href=
"../../Programmer/NiMaterial/Gamebryo_Standard_Material.htm">Gamebryo
Standard Material</a> is used, layering many texture maps onto
the snail, terrain, and snail house. Sample code is provided that
disables each effect independently. The shadow from the snail
shell is generated in code, and is described below.</p>

<h2>Shadow Image Creation</h2>

<p>The shadow image is a square texture that represents the snail
as viewed from the shadow casting light. The shadow is commonly
drawn as black-on-white wherever the snail appears from the
light's point of view is black, and wherever it does not appear
is white (other colors may be chosen for the background and/or
shadow if desired).</p>

<p>In order to create the texture, a camera representing the
shadowing light source is built. The camera is updated to reflect
the animated transform of the light. Finally, the frustum field
of view parameters (left, right, bottom, top) are adjusted so
that they are slightly outside of the bounding sphere of the
shadowing object. As a result, we know that for every frame the
camera will "track and zoom" to follow the character. The
resulting image will always have the character centered and
zoomed to almost fill the image.</p>

<p>This shadow camera is rendered to an off-screen frame buffer,
creating a projected texture map. Since the camera is zoomed to
be slightly wider than the bounding sphere of the character, the
edge pixels of the texture will always be white (or whatever
background color is selected). This behavior is important, since
we will use CLAMP texture addressing with the texture.</p>

<p>Additionally, a special accumulator (a <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MasterPropertyAccumulator</span> object) is used
to render the shadow caster into the shadow map texture. Rather
than sorting the geometry, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MasterPropertyAccumulator</span> object simply
draws all of the geometry that is registered with it, replacing
whatever rendering properties are in each object's property state
with properties that will cause the object to be a flat color -
the shadow color. After rendering each object, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MasterPropertyAccumulator</span> object returns
the original properties to the geometry objects that it
modified.</p>

<h2>Projected Shadow Application</h2>

<p>Applying the texture image as a projected shadow is simple.
The light is modeled as an infinite directional light and the
shadow camera (as described above) is configured to approximate a
parallel projection. To apply the texture to the scene, a
parallel projected shadow <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span></a> is created, and the
projection transformation set to match the parallel projection
that the shadow camera approximates.</p>
