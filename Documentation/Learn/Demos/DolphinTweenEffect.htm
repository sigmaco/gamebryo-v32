<h1>DolphinTweenEffect</h1>

<p>This effect duplicates the Dolphin tweening shader found in
the DirectX SDK. It makes use of the same vertex shader program
code (on DX9), but uses an NSF file to get the shader into
Gamebryo.</p>

<p>Each of the three dolphin poses is stored in its own NIF file,
and the <span class="NDLSystemFont">DolphinTweenEffect</span>
loads all three models and stores the vertices and normals of
each of the second two dolphin meshes as data in additional
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm">NiDataStream</a></span> objects
attached to the first dolphin mesh, which has the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">DolphinTween</span> shader applied to it at
application time. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">SemanticAdapterTable</span> section
of the NSF file contains the remapping from generic semantics
(given when the individual NIFs are combined at load time) to
valid renderer semantics that the vertex shader can make use
of.</p>

<p>One trick that the effect does in the NSF file is to make use
of a global constant that contains the global diffuse lighting
color, but to multiply that constant by the material's diffuse
lighting color using a <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CM_OPERATOR</span> constant map entry. This
allows the calculation to be done on the CPU once per mesh,
rather than in the vertex shader once per vertex.</p>

<p>In order to more closely duplicate the DirectX sample on which
this effect is based, the effect also loads the sea floor model,
and applies a series of 32 textures to both the dolphin and the
sea floor that replicate the caustic effect of light interacting
with the water surface.</p>

<p>As with all other effects, this class relies on a static
instance of a dummy helper class to create an instance of a
<span class="NDLSystemFont">DolphinTweenEffect</span>. This
allows the effect to handle its own creation and initialization
without any need to change the code for the default application
or any other effects.</p>

<p>The D3D10/D3D11 version of this shader adds a geometry shader to the
sea floor that causes the edges of the triangles to be rendered
as lines, effectively creating a wireframe effect.</p>

<h2>Initialization</h2>

<p>During initialization, the first thing to happen is the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderEffect::Init</span> function
gets called, so the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RegisterShaderLibrary</span> will get a chance to
load the shader library. Then, the first dolphin mesh is loaded
and the <span class="NDLSystemFont">DolphinTween</span> shader is
attached to it. This is followed by the sea floor mesh being
loaded along with the 32 caustic textures. Then, the other two
dolphin NIFs are loaded, whose vertex positions and normals will
be used for the blending operations. Additional <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreams</span> are added to the original
mesh object to serve two purposes: first, to store the actual
vertex and normal data from the two additional dolphin NIFs (so
that their entire scene graphs don't need to be kept in memory),
and second, to provide pointers to that additional per-vertex
data to the shader system, which will assign that data into the
vertex streams defined in the NSF file.</p>

<p>Once this is done, the effect sets the global diffuse lighting
color (via the global shader constant named "LightDiffuse") along
with the global weights (via the global shader constant named
"weights"). Then it stores pointers to some objects in the scene
that will be useful later. These include pointers to the 
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturingProperty.htm">NiTexturingProperty</a></span>
objects applied to the dolphin and to the sea floor</p>

<p>Finally, the dolphin is scaled appropriately, the scene is
updated, and the presence of the required "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">DolphinTween</span>" shader is tested to
determine whether the shader was loaded correctly.</p>

<p>The <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Click.htm">
render click</a> created by this function simply holds an
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/Ni3DRenderView.htm">Ni3DRenderView</a></span>
with the main scene and camera. This render click is added to the
<a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Step.htm">
render step</a> created by <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"ShaderEffect.htm">ShaderEffect</a>::Init</span>.</p>

<h2>Shutdown</h2>

<p>The default shutdown function <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderEffect::Shutdown</span> is called, and the
effect clears out its remaining data.</p>

<h2>UpdateScene</h2>

<p>During <span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateScene</span>, the
transform of the dolphin and the weights of each dolphin mesh in
the final tweened result are updated manually (as in the DirectX
sample) via calls to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiFloatsExtraData::SetValue</span> called upon
the "weights" object that is attached to the dolphin mesh.  Then,
the model-space light direction is calculated and set as a global
shader constant, and the caustic shader constants and textures
are updated.</p>

<h2>Enable</h2>

<p>Before calling the default enabling function <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderEffect::Enable</span>, the effect updates
the camera parameters to values appropriate for the scene.</p>
