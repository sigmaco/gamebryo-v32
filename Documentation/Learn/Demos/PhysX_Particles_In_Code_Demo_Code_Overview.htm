<h1>PhysX Particles-In-Code Demo Code Overview</h1>

<p>This section details the functionality of significant member
functions in the application class, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PhysXParticles</span>.</p>

<h2>PhysXParticles::Initialize</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Initialize</span> first creates the
PhysX SDK object via the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efdPhysX/efdPhysX__PhysXSDKManager.htm">efdPhysX::PhysXSDKManager::Initialize</a></span>
function. We must create the PhysX SDK before calling
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiSample/NiSample.htm">NiSample::Initialize</a></span>
because the latter creates PhysX objects via <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span>. We also set several SDK
parameters, including turning off debug visualization. After
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSample::Initialize</span> we
prepare the scene graph and get the asynchronous simulation
started.</p>

<h2>PhysXParticles::CreateScene</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span> calls all of
the top-level object creation functions. It is also responsible
for creating the PhysX scene object. After <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSample::CreateScene</span> and background color
setting, the function creates the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span>
object which will be used to interface the PhysX scene and the
Gamebryo scene. We then create the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NxScene</span> object, using hardware if we
detect it. We then associate the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NxScene</span> with the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span>. A snapshot is required to
support reset, so we create one here and add information about
the scene.</p>

<p>At this point we are ready to populate the scene with actors,
but first we get a material index to use for all the actors. The
particle system is a prop - a collection of PhysX content that
appears as a unit in scene. We create the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysXParticle/NiPhysXPSMeshParticleSystemProp.htm">
NiPhysXPSMeshParticleSystemProp</a></span> object to hold the
prop data, and create a snapshot <a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXPropDesc.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXPropDesc</span></a> object, which will be
used to enable reset. Functions are then called to create the
planar boundaries of the space, the box and the particle system.
The prop is added to the scene when all the content has been
created. Addition of the prop to the scene causes all the PhysX
content to be created in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NxScene</span> object.</p>

<p>The function finishes by creating a light and setting several
parameters on the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span>.
This enables updating of destinations, sets fixed timing,
interpolation of state (although only the cube's state will be
interpolated, not the particles), and turns off debug
rendering.</p>

<p>At the end of <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span>
we prepare a screen texture to show while running up the particle
system.</p>

<h2>PhysXParticles::CreateBox</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateBox</span> makes a simple
box using the geometry factory to produce Gamebryo geometry for
the PhysX box shape, and then sets up a typical dynamic actor. We
assign it to collision group 1, which is the "non-particles"
group in this application. The box is added to the PhysX prop and
the snapshot, and a destination is added to extract state from it
for the Gamebryo object.</p>

<h2>PhysXParticles::CreatePlane</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CreatePlane</span> makes a static
plane which is optionally rendered. We assign it to collision
group 1, which is the "non-particles" group in this application.
The plane is added to the PhysX scene but, because it is static,
there is no need to add any ties to the Gamebryo scene, so it is
not added to the prop.</p>

<h2>PhysXParticles::CreatePSys</h2>

<p>The first step in creating a PhysX-based particle system is to
create the particle system scene graph node. In this case we
create a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysXParticle/NiPhysXPSMeshParticleSystem.htm">
NiPhysXPSMeshParticleSystem</a></span> because we want to render
the particles as small balls. We specify mesh and actor pool
creation on load and a pool size as large as the maximum particle
count. In practice, this will fill the actor pools once a PhysX
scene is specified. We deliberately delay that in this instance
because we want to specify the prototypical actor first. If we
gave the PhysX scene but not the actor then we would not be able
to fill the pool. We also specify that the PhysX scene and the
particle system are in the same space (with the identity
transform in this case) which allows for some optimizations.
After creating the system we attach it to the scene graph.</p>

<p>The next block of code creates a unit-sphere for the rendered
particle mesh, which will be scaled by the particle size to match
the PhysX particle actor size.</p>

<p>At this point we can create the prototypical actor in the form
of a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXActorDesc.htm">NiPhysXActorDesc</a></span>
object. The shape is specified by creating a <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NxSphereShapeDesc</span> object and using it to
set a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXShapeDesc.htm">NiPhysXShapeDesc</a></span>
object which is added to the array of shapes for this actor. We
then create a body using the same basic process. Finally, we
create the actor descriptor and set all its properties. When
creating actor descriptors this way we must specify at least one
pose. For particles the pose values don't matter, but there still
must be a pose to enable actor creation (we use the identity).
Particles get collision group 2, which is later set to not
collide with itself. Hence, particles do not collide with each
other. The particle actor is specified to the particle system. It
is also important to specify a region of space in which to place
the actors of the pool. Creating them all on top of each other
introduces an enormous performance penalty when PhysX starts up.
The region should be big enough to contain a pool's worth of
actors without too much overlap. It should also be some distance
from other actors in the scene, but not so far as to cause
problems with the overall size of the scene.</p>

<p>With an actor descriptor in place we can specify the PhysX
scene for the particle system and implicitly create the actor
pool. We also set up collision filtering here, so that particles
collide with other objects but not themselves.</p>

<p>The final task of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreatePSys</span> is to create an emitter. This
is a standard Gamebryo particle emitter placed at the bottom of
the column to fire particles upward.</p>

<h2>PhysXParticles::UpdateFrame</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateFrame</span> implements a
typical asynchronous simulation loop. If simulation is active, it
first fetches the results from the previous step, which had been
processing while the previous frame was rendering. The
destinations are updated to prepare the particle system to update
the particles from PhysX (the actual work is done during the
scene graph update for the particle system). We emit any
additional particles now, after simulation but before updating
the particle system.</p>

<p>Input is processed after finishing the simulation step. It
must be done here because actions resulting from input might
affect the PhysX SDK, which should not be touched while within a
<span class="NDLSystemFont">simulate/fetchResults</span> pair.
Because we have already blocked on <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span>, we are certain that we are
not simulating at the time we process input.</p>

<p>If the application is not paused, we start up the next
simulation step with a time that we guess will be the next frame
time.</p>

<p>Finally, if we are running-up the particle system we make
certain that the screen texture is being displayed, otherwise we
make certain that the scene is being displayed.</p>

<h2>PhysXParticles::SimulateStart</h2>

<p>Before beginning simulation, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> needs to know what the time
is, which is done through a call to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetFetchTime</span>. We also clear any debug
geometry that might be left over from a previous simulation step.
Finally, we start simulation.</p>

<h2>PhysXParticles::SimulateStop</h2>

<p>To stop simulation we call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span> to complete any existing
simulation and then update the destinations with the results of
the final step.</p>

<h2>PhysXParticles::SimulationReset</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">SimulationReset</span>
function stops the simulation (if running). It resets the
Gamebryo particle system then restores the PhysX scene from
snapshot 0, which we created in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span> when the application started.
We remove any out-dated debug geometry, push the restored actor
states to the scene graph, and restart simulation with a new
run-up period.</p>
