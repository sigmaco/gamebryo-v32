<h1>StreamOutTestEffect</h1>

<p>This effect demonstrates the use of the D3D10/D3D11 stream out
capability in shaders. This is the only effect that makes use of
a number of sub-effects to show various stream-out
configurations.</p>

<p>The scene is the same as the one used in the <a href=
"GlassEffect.htm">GlassEffect</a> effect, but with a different
shader on the teapot. Actually, two shaders are used to render
the teapot: the first shader renders the teapot and uses stream
out to save the results to a vertex buffer in video memory and
the second shader uses that vertex buffer to actually rasterize
the teapot to the screen.</p>

<p>There are a total of seven sub-effects. They show off a number
of different combinations of different ways you can make use of
the output stream. Some use a series of "thin" output streams,
which means that a series of non-interleaved vertex buffers are
used for the vertex positions, color, and normals, while other
use a "fat" output stream, which stores all that data in a single
interleaved vertex buffer. Some of the sub-effects clear the
stream-out buffers before they write more data, and some append
the data to the end of the existing data in the buffer. Some
effects write out from the geometry shader, and others skip the
geometry shader and write out directly from the vertex shader.
Some effects will perform rasterization as part of the stream-out
render pass, while other effects will skip the pixel shader when
writing to the output data streams.</p>

<ol>
    <li>The teapot is streamed out to 3 non-interleaved vertex
    buffers, which are cleared before receiving data. The
    primitives are written from the geometry shader as
    triangles.</li>

    <li>The teapot is streamed out to 1 interleaved vertex
    buffer, which is cleared before receiving data. The
    primitives are written from the geometry shader as
    lines.</li>

    <li>The teapot is streamed out to 3 non-interleaved vertex
    buffers, which are cleared before receiving data. The
    primitives are written from the vertex shader as points.</li>

    <li>The teapot is streamed out to 1 interleaved vertex
    buffer, which is cleared before receiving data. The
    primitives are written from the vertex shader as
    triangles.</li>

    <li>The teapot is streamed out to 3 non-interleaved vertex
    buffers, which are cleared before receiving data. The
    primitives are written from the geometry shader as triangles.
    The stream-out pass performs rasterization, so two triangles
    should be present.</li>

    <li>The teapot is streamed out, one triangle at a time, to 3
    non-interleaved vertex buffers which are cleared not before
    receiving data. The triangles are emitted in projection
    space, so rotating the camera will cause the new triangles to
    show up in a new location, but will not affect triangles that
    had been added in previous frames.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Init</h2>

<p>During initialization, the first thing to happen is the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderEffect::Init</span> function
gets called, so the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RegisterShaderLibrary</span> will get a chance to
load the shader library. Then, the NIF containing the entire
scene is loaded, and the scene graph and camera are extracted
from it. The camera is detached from the scene graph so it can
move independently. Then, the teapot mesh is located so it can
have the stream-out shader applied to it, and a new mesh is
created to allow Gamebryo to render the contents of the
streamed-out vertex buffer. Finally, the scene and the camera are
each updated.</p>

<p>The <a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Click.htm">
render click</a> created by this function simply holds an
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/Ni3DRenderView.htm">Ni3DRenderView</a></span>
with the main scene and camera. This render click is added to the
<a href=
"../../Programmer/Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Step.htm">
render step</a> created by <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"ShaderEffect.htm">ShaderEffect</a>::Init</span>.</p>

<h2>NextSubeffect</h2>

<p>This function is responsible for applying the sub-effect's
shaders to the two meshes. Then it ensures that the mesh that
draws the contents of the streamed-out vertex buffer is hooked up
with the correct vertex buffers, which it does by calling
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a>::BindToStreamOutputOf</span>.</p>

<h2>Shutdown</h2>

<p>The programmatically-created mesh that draws the result of the
stream-out operation is released, and then the default shutdown
function <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderEffect::Shutdown</span> is called.</p>

<h2>UpdateScene</h2>

<p>First, the global shader constant FrameNumber is updated with
the frame number of the current sub-effect. When that frame
number exceeds the primitive count in the final sub-effect, the
stream-out buffers are manually cleared (because that sub-effect
appends subsequent writes to the output buffer rather than
clearing on each render).</p>

<p>Finally, this function simply calls <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> on the scene.</p>

<h2>GetDescription</h2>

<p>Returns a description appropriate for the current
sub-effect.</p>

Considerations</a> for additional details on platform-specific
issues.</p>
