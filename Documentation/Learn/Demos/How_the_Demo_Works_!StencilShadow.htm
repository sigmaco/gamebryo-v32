<h1>How the StencilShadow Demo Works</h1>

<p>The following sections describe how the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">StencilShadow</span> sample creates the shadow
effect using the stencil buffer and an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> object. The method and code are detailed function-by-function:</p>

<h2>The Stencil Buffer Shadow "Trick"</h2>

<p>This form of shadowing relies on a stencil buffer and an
important geometric observation: A point is inside a simple,
closed polyhedron if and only if any ray from the point to
infinity intersects the polyhedron an odd number of times. In
most cases (i.e. when the camera is not in the polyhedron), this
is equivalent to saying that there are an odd number of polygons
between the eye-point and the point being tested.</p>

<p>The stencil buffer may be used to accelerate this test in
hardware. Here is how the shadow works:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Clear the stencil, depth and back buffers</li>

    <li>Draw the basic scene to the frame buffer with depth
    buffering on and stencil buffering off</li>

    <li>Draw the volume that encloses the shadow as a closed,
    double-sided polyhedron (the "Shadow Volume") with depth
    buffering set to read only and stencil buffering set to
    increment the stencil buffer whenever a pixel passed the z
    buffer test. This polygon should be alpha blended&mdash;it
    can even be completely translucent. The stencil buffer will
    still be written for a translucent pixel, as long as alpha
    testing is not enabled.</li>

    <li>Now, the back buffer contains the main scene, and the
    stencil buffer contains odd values for all main scene objects
    that fall inside of the shadow volume.</li>

    <li>Finally, draw a screen-space rectangle (<span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiMeshScreenElements</span> ), the "Shadow
    Overlay", that covers the entire screen. Use alpha blending
    to make the rectangle darken anything it covers. Set the
    stencil buffer to write the pixel color only where the
    stencil buffer is odd (i.e. the stencil buffer value is equal
    to 1 when a mask of 0x00000001 is used).</li>
</ul>

<p>The scene is now darkened at any visible pixels that represent
points inside of the shadow volume.</p>
