<h1>CollisionTestDynamic Demo Code Overview</h1>

<p>The main application code for this demo (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CollisionTestDynamic</span>, subclassed from
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSample</span>) is fairly
straightforward. The bulk of the collision tracking, management,
and response code is implemented in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Interact</span> class.</p>

<p>The following are the principal functions in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CollisionTestDynamic</span> class.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">
CollisionTestDynamic::CreateScene</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Creates an instance of the
Interact class and opens a NIF file that contains the geometry
and ABVs for the entire room. It also initializes the room
surfaces for collision detection, as collidees, using the
artist-created ABV trees, by calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Interact::AddCollidee</span>. It also initializes
the camera to the defined parameters in the art file.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">
CollisionTestDynamic::Initialize</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Calls the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSample</span> (base class) version, and tells
the collision detection system that velocities will be factored
into the detection process.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">
CollisionTestDynamic::ShootBullet</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Manages any delay, if needed,
between firing bullets, reports when there are no more bullets,
and obtains a new bullet via <span class="NDLSystemFont">Interact::ShootBullet</span>. Then,
it adds the new bullet to the scene graph and performs the
necessary updates.&lt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The following are the principal functions in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Interact</span> class.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">Interact::AddCollidee</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to add room surfaces
(wall, ceiling, and so on) as collidees for the collision group, since
room surfaces will not be moving in the scene. The collision
detection system would default to creating OBB trees to use for
collision detection for each room surface if bCreateOBBs were
true. However, as the art assets contain ABVs, those are used,
and bCreateOBBs is always false in this demo.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">Interact::GetNextBullet</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Returns the next available
bullet after changing the necessary member variables to ensure
proper memory handling.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">Interact::ShootBullet</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Gets the next available bullet
and adds it as a collider for the collision group. The collision
detection system in this case uses the artist created ABV tree to
use for collision detection for each bullet.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">Interact::UpdateCollisions</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Calls <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCollisionGroup::FindCollisions</span>, which
directs the collision detection system to find all collisions
among the colliders and collidees within the collision group. It
calls the callback function <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Interact::Callback</span> which maintains a list
of collisions reported. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FindCollisions</span> is paired with calls to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Interact::ResolveCollision</span>,
which simulates simple physics response to the collisions. These
two functions iterate multiple times so that any new collisions
caused by the new direction and velocity of a bullet can also be
detected. Finally, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Interact::UpdateBullet</span> is called by this
function for each bullet.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">Interact::ResolveCollision</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Manages the bulk of the
collision response behaviors. If a bullet has collided with
either another bullet or one of the walls of the room, then
energy may be dissipated (accomplished by reducing the speed of
the bullet), the direction of the velocity may be altered
(accomplished by reflecting it through a contact normal when the
angle of collision is obtuse), and the angular velocity may be
updated (accomplished by using a moment arm to determine how much
the bullet should rotate about its center of mass). Additionally,
this function may reclassify the collider bullets as collidees,
when the velocity is small enough. (Thus, the demo has made use
of a simplifying assumption that motionless objects do not later
re-enter the simulation as moving objects.)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">Interact::UpdateBullet</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Simulates the physics of
rigid-body free fall motion on all live bullets.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">Interact::Callback</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Saves collisions that occur
between objects. When a collider will hit two objects in one time
step, the non-bullet-to-bullet collision is saved in order to
avoid bullets passing through the ground plane when interacting
with other bullets. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Interact::ResolveCollision</span> function will
handle collision response.</p>
