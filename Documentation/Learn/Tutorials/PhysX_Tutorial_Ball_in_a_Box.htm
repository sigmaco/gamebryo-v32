<h1>PhysX Tutorial - Ball in a Box</h1>

<p>The aim of this portion of the Gamebryo-PhysX tutorial 
 is to show how PhysX content is loaded into Gamebryo and how it is updated 
 at run-time. The code extends the <a HREF="PhysX_Tutorial_Initializing_the_SDK.htm">Initializing 
 the SDK</a> tutorial. When you start the application, you should see a 
 ball bouncing up and down a few times in a box. </p>

<h2>Creating a PhysX Scene</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span> function 
 does the work of loading and instantiating PhysX content.</p>

<p>The first task is to create an <a HREF="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a> 
 object to manage the PhysX <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene</span> object, 
 and to create the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene</span> object itself. 
 The last stage in preparing the scene to receive objects is to associate 
 the PhysX scene with the Gamebryo scene:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spPhysScene-&gt;SetPhysXScene(pkScene);</span></p>

<p>At this stage we are ready to add PhysX props to the 
 scene. We load the box file, just as you would a regular NIF file. PhysX 
 content is stored in a top-level object in the file stream. To find it, 
 we need to loop over the top-level objects looking for something of type 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXProp.htm">NiPhysXProp</a></span>: 
 </p>

<pre>
// Look for a camera and the PhysX content. In this case, the PhysX
// content is the box model.
NiPhysXPropPtr spBoxProp = 0;
for (unsigned int ui = 1; ui &lt; kStream.GetObjectCount(); ui++)
{
    if (NiIsKindOf(NiCamera, kStream.GetObjectAt(ui)))
    {
        m_spCamera = (NiCamera*)kStream.GetObjectAt(ui);
    }
    else if (NiIsKindOf(NiPhysXProp, kStream.GetObjectAt(ui)))
    {
        // We have found the PhysX content in the NIF.
        spBoxProp = (NiPhysXProp*)kStream.GetObjectAt(ui);
    }
}
NIASSERT(spBoxProp != 0);
</pre>

<p>We load another NIF file containing data for the ball 
 object, and we find the PhysX prop within the file.</p>

<p>We can optimize the updating of transformations when 
 actors are sleeping. This is only appropriate if there is no moving object 
 in the scene graph below the actor-controlled object. In this case there 
 is nothing moving below the ball in the scene graph. Here we directly 
 access the destination that is responsible for the state update. We could 
 also access the prop's snapshot, then the actor's snapshot, and then its 
 destination (which would ultimately be the same object).</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">((NiPhysXRigidBodyDest*)spBallProp->GetDestinationAt(0))-&gt;SetOptimizeSleep(true)</span></p> 

<p>Loading the props does not create them in the PhysX 
 scene. To do so, we add the props into the scene:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spPhysScene-&gt;AddProp(spBallProp);</span></p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spPhysScene-&gt;AddProp(spBoxProp);</span></p>

<p>This causes several things to happen. It registers the 
 prop as an object that needs updating by Gamebryo when this scene is updated. 
 Because the scene we are attaching to already has an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene</span> 
 object, adding the prop also causes its PhysX content to be created in 
 the PhysX scene, thus completely preparing the object for simulation.</p>

<p>After instantiating the props, the last step in creating 
 the scene is enabling destination updates. A destination in Gamebryo-PhysX 
 is a scene graph object that is controlled by physics. In this case, the 
 ball is to be controlled by the physical ball. Destinations updating must 
 be explicitly enabled: </p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spPhysScene-&gt;SetUpdateDest(true)</span></p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">We are now ready to simulate.</span></p>

<h2>Run-Time Updating</h2>

<p>Gamebryo-PhysX adds some steps to the update process 
 to push data to and from the physics simulation. In this application the 
 work is done in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateFrame</span> function. 
 After processing input, we start a simulation step with </p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spPhysScene-&gt;Simulate(m_fAccumTime);</span></p>

<p>The argument is the time we want to simulate to, in 
 this case global application time.This gets simulation started. To get 
 the answers, we have to call </p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spPhysScenee-&gt;FetchResults(m_fAccumTime, true);</span></p>

<p>The argument is the time we want to fetch for, which 
 will almost always be the same as the time we were simulating to. The 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">true</span> argument forces the function to 
 wait for simulation to finish, because we need the answers now. When this 
 function returns, physics state is ready to be used in the Gamebryo scene 
 graph. To set the scene graph transformation, we must update the destinations, 
 in this case the ball: </p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spPhysScene-&gt;UpdateDestinations(m_fAccumTime);</span></p>

<p>This causes the pose of the PhysX actor be extracted 
 and pushed into the Gamebryo scene graph node's transformation. To 
 apply this transformation for rendering, we still need to call update 
 on the scene graph. </p>

<h2>Simulation Reset</h2>

<p>The call </p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spPhysScene-&gt;RestoreSnapshotState(0);</span></p>

<p>restores the pose and velocity of the ball to the state 
 that was loaded from the NIF file. You can create other snapshots if desired 
 and restore from any one of them. </p>
