<h1>Core Runtime Tutorial 4: Scene Attachment</h1>

<p>This tutorial simply illustrates attaching one scene graph to another.</p>

<h2>The Demo</h2>

<p>The demo, as in previous tutorials, loads a cityscape from file. But in addition, it also loads
a helicopter from a separate file (OBJECT.NIF). Then it attaches the helicopter to the main scene.
When the demo runs, a cityscape is seen with a small helicopter directly in the center of the
screen.</p>

<h2>What You Should See After Running the Tutorial</h2>

<p>All platforms should display a cityscape with a small helicopter in the center of the screen.
The following screen capture was taken from the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Win32</span>
platform.</p>

<div class="NDLFigureContainer">
    <img src="images/tutorial4.jpg" width="515" height="400" alt="tutorial4 (63K)">

    <p class="NDLFigureCaption">Scene attachment</p>
</div>

<h2>The Relevant Code</h2>

<p>In order to attach the helicopter to our world scene, we have to choose a point of attachment.
We could simply attach the helicopter as a child of the root. That would work. However, we would
like the artist or designer to be able to choose the helicopter's starting location. The easiest
way to accommodate this is for the artist to place an agreed upon named node in the scene which we
can key off of. The node will have all the appropriate transforms and we'll simply attach our
helicopter to that node. In this tutorial, we have arbitrarily agreed upon the name "AttachmentBox"
for the node we are going to attach our helicopter to. All we have to do as programmers is to find
that node and attach it.</p>

<p>The first bit of relevant code that has been added to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateScene</span> function is shown below, in which we use the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiNode.htm">NiNode</a></span> call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetObjectByName</span>. This call is of the same variety of recursive scene
traversal calls that we created from scratch in the previous tutorial. It takes the name of the
string we wish to search for and recursively searches down the sub-tree until it finds the named
object or has exhausted its search.</p>
<pre>
    NiNode* pkAttachPt = (NiNode*) m_spScene-&gt;GetObjectByName(
        "AttachmentBox");
    NIASSERT(NiIsKindOf(NiNode, pkAttachPt));
    if (!pkAttachPt)
    {
        NiMessageBox("There needs to be an object in the WORLD.NIF named"
            " \"AttachmentBox\".", "NIF Error");
        return false;
    }
</pre>

<p>In the next lines of code, we load the file "OBJECT.NIF" which contains our helicopter model.
For an explanation of the streaming code, please refer to <a href=
"Tutorial_2__Nif_Files.htm">Tutorial 2: Nif Files</a>.</p>
<pre>
    bSuccess = kStream.Load(
        NiApplication::ConvertMediaFilename("OBJECT.NIF"));
    
    if (!bSuccess)
    {
        NiMessageBox("OBJECT.NIF file cannot be loaded!", "NIF Error");
        return false;
    }
    NiNode* pkHeli = (NiNode*) kStream.GetObjectAt(0);
    NIASSERT(NiIsKindOf(NiNode, pkHeli));
</pre>

<p>The final line of code added to this tutorial attaches the helicopter to our attachment point
that we found earlier. It is important to note that once we have attached <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">pkHeli</span> as a child of the attachment point, it will have been attached
internally as a smart pointer. This means that it will have had its reference incremented and
deletion will be handled when its reference count reaches zero. Hence, from this point on, we no
longer have to worry about freeing it ourselves.</p>
<pre>
   pkAttachPt-&gt;AttachChild(pkHeli);
</pre>

<h2>Moving on...</h2>

<p>We've walked through the steps for attaching one scene graph to another. In the next phase,
we'll cover transforms that involve translations and rotations. See <a href=
"Tutorial_5__Transforms.htm">Core Runtime Tutorial 5: Transforms</a>.</p>
