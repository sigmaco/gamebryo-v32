<h1>Product Tour: Editing 3D Content</h1>

<p>In previous section of the Product Tour, you learned about creating entity instances, entity models, and entity behaviors. This section introduces you to the tools for interacting with the
graphical, 3D content that is required to make your game.</p>

</ol>

<h2>The Digital Content Creation Tools</h2>

<p>Gamebryo LightSpeed supports the three major Digital Content Creation tools: 3ds Max, Maya, and
XSI with robust and fully-featured exporters. Let's explore the Maya exporter by taking a look at
the graphics for the player character. The source asset for this character installs by default in
the following location:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Samples\GameDemos\MangledMetal\Art
Files\Export\Characters\Vandal\Vandal.mb</span>.</p>

<p>If you installed the Maya exporter, you should be able to open this asset in Maya.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img alt="Vandal in Maya" src="images/VandalMaya.jpg">

    <p class="FigureCaption">The Vandal character in Maya</p>
</div>

<p>The exporters support a wide variety of features, including animations, particle systems,
materials, pixel and vertex shaders, lighting, and much more. For more information about these
exporters, see the following sections:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="../../Art/Max/Max_Plug_in_Introduction.htm">Gamebryo 3ds Max Plug-in</a></li>

    <li><a href="../../Art/Maya/Maya_Plug_in_Introduction.htm">Gamebryo Maya Plug-in</a></li>

    <li><a href="../../Art/XSI/XSI_intro.htm">Gamebryo XSI Plug-in</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you were to <a href=
"../../Art/Maya/How_To__Create_a_Single_Maya_File_Character.htm">export</a> the Vandal character
from Maya, it would produce several files:</p>

<ul>
    <li>NIF file&mdash;This file contains the geometry and bones for the character. It is also
    possible for this file to contain platform-specific versions of your textures.</li>

    <li>KF file&mdash;This file contains the animation sequences for your character.</li>

    <li>KFM file&mdash;This file contains a database of your animation sequences and how they
    interact with each other. This file may be originally generated from the DCC tool, but it is
    primarily edited in the Animation Tool. In fact, if you were to re-export the Vandal character,
    you would be given an option to overwrite this file and you would choose not to.</li>
</ul>

<p>A generic version of these assets have already been generated for the Vandal. By default, these
files install to the following location:</p>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>Samples\GameDemos\MangledMetal\Data\MangledMetal\GamebryoData\Generic\Characters\Vandal\</span></p>

<table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
    <tr align="left">
        <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD">
            <p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>

            <div class="NDLNote">
                Rapid iteration of NIF, KF, and KFMs are supported. For example, by modifying and
                re-exporting out one of the various MangledMetal art assets, you can see the
                resulting changes show up in the running MangledMetal application and also in World
                Builder. Note, however, that World Builder uses the "Generic" version of the
                assets. This means that a targeted export for DX9 may serve only to update the
                MangledMetal application, but not World Builder. Likewise, a "Generic" targeted
                export would update Toolbench but might not update the MangledMetal application.
            </div>

<h2>Asset Viewer</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, the Vandal character exports out to a NIF file, which contains all of the
geometry and bones for character.</p>

<p>In the image below, we've opened up the previously exported NIF file for the Vandal, found at
<span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Samples\GameDemos\MangledMetal\Data\MangledMetal\GamebryoData\Generic\Characters\Vandal\Vandal.nif</span>.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img alt="Vandal in Maya" src="images/VandalAssetViewer.jpg">

    <p class="FigureCaption">The Vandal character in Asset Viewer</p>
</div>

<p>Above, take note to the Scene Graph Tree view on the right-hand side of <a href=
"../../Tools/Asset_Viewer/Introduction_to_the_Asset_Viewer.htm">Asset Viewer</a>. Gamebryo
LightSpeed represents 3D graphics objects using a scene graph. Scene graphs represent graphical
data using hierarchical parent-child relationships. In the case of the Vandal, the bones that
define the Vandal's skeleton are nodes in the graph which are rooted at the pelvis. Other nodes,
like "khador_lj_geoShape", represent the 3D geometry of the Vandal.</p>

<p>Asset Viewer is a great tool for understanding how the exporters are converting your DCC
content. You can explore all of the parameters for a given scene graph node in the Scene Graph Tree
view by right-clicking the desired entry and choosing "Properties" from the context menu.</p>

<h2>Animation Tool</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, the Vandal character exports out to KF files, which contain all of the
animation sequences for the character, like "idle", "walk", and "run". These files can be combined
and edited in the <a href="../../Tools/Animation_Tool/Introduction_to_Animation_Tool.htm">Animation
Tool</a>.</p>

<p>In the image below, we've opened up the previously generated KFM file for the Vandal, found at
<span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Samples\GameDemos\MangledMetal\Data\MangledMetal\GamebryoData\Generic\Characters\Vandal\Vandal.kfm</span>.
KFM files are essentially animation databases where the artist has set up transitions between
individual animation sequences so that they may be correctly played back in-game.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img alt="Vandal in Animation Tool" src="images/VandalAnimTool.jpg">

    <p class="FigureCaption">The Vandal character in Animation Tool.</p>
</div>

<p>The Vandal is playing the "charge_attack" animation in the image above. You can get a preview of
any animation sequence by clicking on an animation sequence name in the Project View. The
transition table below identifies how the individual animations interact with each other. Click any
transition in the table to get a preview of how the two animations will blend.</p>

<p>Individual animations can be activated within Behavior scripts for entities. For more
information on this, see the <a href=
"../../Programmer/Scripting/lua_lib_egmAnimation.htm">egmAnimation</a> Lua reference documentation
and the <a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Actor.htm">StandardModelLibrary::Actor
Model</a> reference documentation. The Vandal mixes-in this model through the MMActor model.</p>

<p>The AnimationTool also allows you to play with the character in rag-doll mode. See <a href=
"../../Tools/Animation_Tool/Working_With_Physical_Sequences_in_Animation_Tool.htm">Working With
Physical Sequences in Animation Tool</a> for more details. Similar to the animation sequences,
rag-doll and other physics actions can be used in entity Behaviors. For more information, see
<a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/PhysXModelLibrary__PhysXRagdoll.htm">PhysXModelLibrary::PhysXRagdoll</a>
and documentation about <a href=
"../../Programmer/SystemServices/physx_system_service_intro.htm">PhysX System Services</a>.
Additional information about creating and setting up rag-dolls with <a href=
"../../Art/Max/Creating_Ragdolls_with_Max.htm">Max</a> and <a href=
"../../Art/Maya/Creating_Ragdolls_with_Maya.htm">Maya</a> is also available.</p>

<p>For more information on the types of blending supported in Animation Tool and to find out more
about the tool, you should consider following the <a href=
"../../Tools/Animation_Tool/Animation_Tool_Working.htm">Animation Tool tutorial track</a>.</p>

<table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
    <tr align="left">
        <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD">
            <p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>

            <div class="NDLNote">
                Rapid iteration of KFM files is supported. For example, you can edit a KFM file
                using the Animation Tool while you have your MangledMetal application running. When
                you save the KFM, any changes to the various sequence transitions will be reflected
                in the running game.
