<h1>MOUT Sample Code Overview</h1>

<p>The MOUT source code is divided into several files
constituting the application's C++ classes. The MOUT source code
has also been extensively commented inline to give details on
operations of the code. Each class is contained within source
files (.h and .cpp) of the same name. The purpose of the
following class descriptions is to give developers some idea of
the way that the collection of classes in MOUT work together to
provide overall functionality. For this reason, the dependency
listings for each class should be of high interest.</p>

<h2>MOUT</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">MOUT</span> is the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiApplication/Introduction_to_NiApplication.htm">
NiApplication</a></span> derived class for the MOUT application. 
The specific interfaces it relies on from <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span> are for initialization
(<span class="NDLSystemFont">MOUT::Initialize</span>), shutdown
(<span class="NDLSystemFont">MOUT::Terminate</span> ), renderer
and scene creation (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MOUT::CreateRenderer</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MOUT::CreateScene</span>), and frame update and
rendering (<span class="NDLSystemFont">MOUT::OnIdle</span>).</p>

<p>Somewhat unique to the MOUT sample (relative to most other
Gamebryo sample applications) is the fact that little of the real
work done in the application is maintained in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MOUT</span> class itself. As such, and in
addition to its dependency on <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiApplication/Introduction_to_NiApplication.htm">
NiApplication</a></span>, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MOUT</span> class is dependent on the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderHelper</span> classes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>: The
    world creation and data loading occurs in <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> (and its dependent
    classes). This can be seen directly in <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">MOUT::CreateScene</span> where the only work
    done is the creation of the single <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> and execution of the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> method that
    handles "world loading" (<span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::LoadWorld</span>). Similarly,
    the idle time processing of MOUT directly in <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">MOUT::OnIdle</span> is limited in code scope
    most of the real application work is done through calls to
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::Update</span> and
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::Draw</span>.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderHelper</span> : The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">MOUT</span> class maintains the
    application instance of the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ShaderHelper</span> class, which is used to
    initialize and load shaders into the Gamebryo Shader
    system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>WorldManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> is the main
"operations hub" for the MOUT demo. As mentioned in the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">MOUT</span> class description, the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> is used to create
the world (as called in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MOUT::CreateScene</span>) and handle the
application's run-time processing via several <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> interface calls in
<span class="NDLSystemFont">MOUT::OnIdle</span>. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> is globally available via a
static <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::Get</span>
function.</p>

<p>Of particular interest in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> is the way in which it draws
the scene elements of the MOUT application. The function
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Draw</span> is called directly from
<span class="NDLSystemFont">MOUT::OnIdle</span>. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Draw</span> is first responsible for making sure
the character's rendered shadow is up to date it does this by
using <span class="NDLSystemFont">Soldier</span> interfaces to
render the shadow texture. </p>

<p>Overall, MOUT uses a "breakout" rendering technique to
explicitly draw its world. "Breakout" rendering is a Gamebryo
rendering strategy that can be useful for applications that don't
maintain a single, monolithic scene graph (that would simply be
culled and rendered in a single shot with <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawScene</span> or equivalent code). 
"Breakout" rendering requires a little more code than one-shot
single scene graph rendering, but can be both more flexible and,
in some cases, more efficient than the
traditional one-shot rendering.  The breakout technique involves
culling several smaller scene graphs to independent visible
arrays, opening an accumulator, and then registering the multiple
visible arrays with the single accumulator. The culling and
accumulator registration operations can be done in widely spaced
parts of the code, with the accumulator serving as the gateway to
final rendering for all of them. In fact, more than one
accumulator can be used over the course of a frame, allowing for
even more powerful rendering techniques.</p>

<p>In MOUT, the first step that <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::Draw</span> takes when rendering a
frame is to "open" the next frame for rendering with <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderer::BeginFrame</span>. The soldier
shadow is rendered via <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Soldier::RenderShadow</span>. This process
involves rendering the character scene graph to an offscreen
texture render target. </p>

<p>Next, onscreen scene rendering setup is accomplished via a
call to the camera system's <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CameraController::DrawAllCameras</span> method. 
<span class="NDLSystemFont">DrawAllCameras</span> executes the
first steps of "breakout" rendering for the main scene by calling
the required <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderer</span>
functions directly to open the onscreen render target for
drawing. The camera manager also sets up the view data for the
rendering, based upon the currently active camera. It then calls
back into <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::DrawWorld</span> to draw the
onscreen scene itself.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::DrawWorld</span>
first culls and draws the skydome to the screen directly (with no
sorting), using the helper function <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::PartialRender</span>, which culls
any given scene graph and then renders it (using an accumulator
if one exists on the renderer). Since there is no accumulator
attached to the renderer, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PartialRender</span> will simply draw the culled
skydome immediately to the renderer.</p>

<p>PartialRender is a rather simple but commonly used function in
the demo. It culls the scene graph that is passed in into a
locally-held visible array, and then calls <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawVisibleArrayAppend</span> to render or add
the objects into the current accumulator. </p>

<p>In order to draw the transparent objects of the main parts of
the world properly (i.e. after drawing the skydome), <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">DrawWorld</span> sets an accumulator upon the
renderer and opens the accumulator for receiving geometry before
rendering any more objects.  To avoid expensive depth sorting,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">DrawWorld</span> relies on an
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFastAlphaAccumulator</span> to
defer rendering of the transparent objects until after opaque
ones are drawn. The "fast" version of the alpha accumulator does
not sort any objects back-to-front, but instead renders the
opaque objects first, then the alpha-tested objects, and then the
alpha-blended objects last. By sticking to mainly tested and
glowing (i.e. additive) blended objects, sorting is not
required.</p>

<p>Depending on the particular objects being drawn, the default
accumulator will be turned on or off via the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/Introduction_to_the_DX9Renderer.htm">
NiRenderer</a></span> Get/SetSorter functions as necessary
(attaching a NULL accumulator to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderer</span> causes the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawVisibleArray</span> functions to render the
objects directly to the device). <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">DrawWorld</span> also dispatches drawing to other
classes in MOUT as necessary, such as via <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Soldier::Draw</span>.</p>

<p>Next, <span class="NDLSystemFont">DrawWorld</span> draws the
buildings in the scene in a unique way with the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">DrawBuildings</span> method. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">DrawBuildings</span> traverses the scene
sub-graph of the scene buildings (which is established at load
time in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::LoadWorld</span>) and checks for
the presence of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiBooleanExtraData.htm">NiBooleanExtraData</a></span>
objects on geometry that is set <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">true</span>. When a piece of geometry is marked
this way, its render state (via <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPropertyState.htm">NiPropertyState</a></span>)
is swapped temporarily to use one that puts the building in a
transparent x-ray mode. Specific details on the setup of the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiBooleanExtraData.htm">NiBooleanExtraData</a></span>
elements for building tagging can be found in inline comments of
<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::ProcessBuildings</span>,
<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::SetAsSoldierBlocker</span> and also
<span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::DrawBuildings</span>
itself.</p>

<p>Once the 3D elements from the main scene are all rendered,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::DrawWorld</span> calls
<span class="NDLSystemFont">FinishAccumulating</span> upon the
accumulator to render the alpha-blended objects that were
encountered during rendering of the main scene. It then returns
control to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CameraController::DrawAllCameras</span>, which
renders the 2D screen overlays and logos. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> then closes the onscreen
render target, completing the actual rendering of the onscreen
scene. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CameraController::DrawAllCameras</span> returns
back up to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::Draw</span>. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::Draw</span> simply ends the current
frame and displays it to the screen, completing the rendering of
a frame.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> maintains
sub-managers (and accessor functions) for the other MOUT
application classes that are effectively globally accessible to
the entire application. Therefore <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> is dependent on most of the
other classes in the MOUT application.</p>

<h2>BipedCharacter</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">BipedCharacter</span> provides the
basis for a character class that can be used in applications that
require an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm">NiActorManager</a></span>
driven character. It is used in MOUT as a base for the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Soldier</span> class. It includes
support for a rendered texture shadow, random idle animations,
various base-level data access methods, and several pure-virtual
interfaces for methods that handle drawing and locomotion.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">BipedCharacter</span> is dependent
on three other application classes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry</span>: 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">BipedCharacter</span> maintains
    an instance of <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry</span> for giving the
    character a rendered shadow. <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">BipedCharacter</span> has the interfaces for
    application access to shadow texture and shadow geometry
    rendering (it does not directly expose the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry</span> object itself).</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>:
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> debugging
    interfaces are used by <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">BipedCharacter</span>. Also, the terrain
    manager is accessed by <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">BipedCharacter</span> via the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> interfaces.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span>: The
    terrain manager is accessed solely to correlate the ground
    object maintained by the terrain manager system and the
    character's shadow.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Soldier</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Soldier</span> provides
specialized, <span class="NDLSystemFont">MOUT</span>-specific
behavior to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">BipedCharacter</span>
base class, including input-based transform updating, drawing,
and code to determine if the Soldier is obscured in the camera
view by buildings.</p>

<p>Many of the details of the operation of this class are
specified in inline source comments for <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Soldier</span>. Of particular interest might be
<span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateCollisionBasedPosition</span>,
which is used to determine if movement for the character is valid
relative to collisions with buildings, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CheckForBlockedCameraView</span>, which
determines if buildings obscure the camera's view of the
character.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Soldier</span> class is
dependent on the following other MOUT application classes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> is
    accessed in the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">UpdateBipedRootTransforms</span> function to
    obtain the current input values for setting the character's
    world rotation. The current camera pitch and yaw values are
    used to set the look-at nodes on the character's torso and
    neck.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span>: This
    application class is used by the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Soldier</span> in two different ways. First,
    the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span>
    provides access to collision detection routines for
    determining intersections with the MOUT scene's buildings. 
    The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Soldier</span> uses the
    <a href=
    "../../Reference/NiCollision/Introduction_to_Collision.htm"><span class="NDLSystemFont">
    NiCollision</span></a> system with both static and dynamic
    (velocity-based) collision to determine if movements are safe
    without causing building intersections. Additionally, the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span> provides
    interfaces for the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Soldier</span>
    to use the <a href=
    "../../Reference/NiCollision/NiPick.htm"><span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiPick</span></a> system to determine if any
    buildings are blocking the camera view of the character.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> is used to
    ground the soldier on the terrain both during initialization
    (<span class="NDLSystemFont">Initialize</span>) and run-time
    updating of the character's position (<span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">UpdateCollisionBasedPosition</span>).</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> is used for
    global access of its sub-managers as well as debug logging.
    Additionally, its <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">SetAsSoldierBlocker</span> function is used
    by the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Soldier::CheckForBlockedCameraView</span>
    function. This call is used to mark buildings as obstructing
    the camera's view of the character (which allows the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> to change the
    drawing mode of the blocking building to be translucent,
    implementing the x-ray view feature).</li>
</ul>

<h2>CollisionManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span> handles
scene level picking and collision interactions. It is used by
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Soldier</span> class for
determining if there are character-to-building collision
intersections, as determined by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Introduction_to_Collision.htm">NiCollision</a></span>
system. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Soldier</span> uses
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span> for ray
intersection (picking via <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/NiPick.htm">NiPick</a></span>)
purposes with the buildings in the scene to determine if any
given building obstructs the view of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Soldier</span>. This same picking system is used
by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> for
the purposes of determining if a building obstructs the view of
the lens flare elements (when it is in the camera's view).</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span> is
dependent on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">Soldier:</span> <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span> accesses a collision
    record maintained as a member of the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Soldier</span> class. This record, when
    collisions are detected, is used to hold information about
    the intersection that occurred including things like time of
    collisions, intersection points and normals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>TerrainManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> loads and
manages a separate NIF file that is assumed to contain only a
single object that represents just the ground plane that should
be picked against (via <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/NiPick.htm">NiPick</a></span>) to
determine height placement for objects above the terrain. The
<span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> is created and
initialized by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> is used
by the Soldier (primarily in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Soldier::UpdateCollisionBasedPosition</span>) to
ground the soldier on the terrain. It is also used by the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> to prevent
the camera from going through the ground.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> is
dependent on only the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> solely for debug logging
purposes.</p>

<h2>CameraController</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> class
implements a form of "smart camera". The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> adds numerous features
beyond a standard Gamebryo camera and hides implementation
details from other parts of the application.</p>

<p>The major features of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> include Smart Camera and
User Interface / 2D Effects Camera.</p>

<h3>Smart Camera</h3>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span>
supports a character-relative, "over-the-shoulder" camera. The
camera is rigidly fixed to the end of an invisible "rod" that
would stick out of the back of the character. The rod can pivot
up and down at the character (pitch), and the rod's length can be
changed (zoom, of a sort). The camera uses the character's head
as the look-at point (the pivot end of the rod), and the
character's heading as its heading. The user can adjust the
elevation and length of the rod with the mouse. This camera
allows the user to change the distance of the camera from the
character and the elevation of the camera while always focusing
on the character.</p>

<p>The method supports both first- and third-person cameras by
popping from the default third-person view into a first-person
camera when the camera moves close enough to the character (i.e.
the invisible rod becomes short enough) that his body obscures
the view ahead.</p>

<p>The camera can also be zoomed in-place from 1x to 4x zoom. 
This trick is accomplished very simply by adjusting the left,
right, top, and bottom view frustum values inward, creating a
"telephoto lens" effect. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateAllCameras</span> method zooms the camera
in or out smoothly, depending upon the status of the left mouse
button. By keeping the current zoom multiplier as a member
variable, the zoom level (frustum values) can be animated
smoothly per frame, based on the desired zoom speed and
frame-to-frame time delta.</p>

<p>Using the terrain system, the camera automatically avoids
"clipping" through the terrain. Two different methods are used
to avoid this problem. The simpler method limits the amount that
the camera arm can pivot down (i.e. look up the camera end of the
"rod" must go down for the camera to look up) based on the
distance of the camera from the character (i.e. the length of the
"rod") such that the camera can never go lower than the height of
the character's feet. This covers a wide range of cases, but
does not handle the case where the terrain at the soldier is
lower than the terrain under the camera. In that case, the
system corrects by querying the terrain height under the camera
and swings the camera up slightly to hover just over the
terrain.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> also
handles parsing of the mouse input. This generates the camera
elevation, distance and zoom as discussed above, but also
participates in the orientation of the character itself. The
lateral mouse movement is used to update and store a world-space
heading (yaw) for the character. The Soldier class uses this
information to orient the character each frame.</p>

<p>In addition, at the low-level the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> applies a constant
rotation to the "smart camera", changing from Gamebryo's standard
Y-up to a Z-up orientation that matches the coordinates of the
art package used to create the demo (3ds Max).</p>

<h3>User Interface / 2D Effects Camera</h3>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> supports a
set of 2D user interface and effects objects that are
automatically rendered each frame, overlaying the 3D scene. This
camera is used to implement several additional effects and UI
elements each frame, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Support for a rotating, sliding "automap" image, locating
    the character in the scene at all times. This is attached to
    the 3D UI camera. The automap consists of a fixed circular
    polygon, with a hand-drawn map texture applied. As the
    character moves and changes heading, the texture UVs are
    computed from a set of circular coordinates that are stored
    in the class. Offsets and rotations are applied to these
    coordinates so that the texture at the center of the circle
    matches the character's location and the orientation of the
    texture matches the character's heading.</li>

    <li>A lens flare effect, simulating glare off of camera lens
    elements when the camera aims in the general direction of the
    sun. This is a 3D-relative effect, but is actually drawn
    entirely using the 2D UI camera. The effect involves a set
    of 2D lens flare elements that are faded in and out based on
    how close the center of the view approaches the direction of
    the sun's light. If visible, the elements are placed along a
    line on the screen that connects the location of the sun in
    the view and the center of the screen, aligning completely
    when the view direction centers upon the screen. To add to
    the realism of the effect, an occlusion system (described
    below) supports smoothly attenuating the brightness of the
    lens flare based upon the partial or total visibility of the
    sun from the viewer's location.</li>

    <li>Optional frame rate indicator overlay, attached to the 2D
    UI camera. The <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> uses the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiApplication/NiFrameRate.htm">NiFrameRate</a></span>
    class to generate and display this information.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span>
depends upon several of the other support classes in the
application for specific features:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> uses the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> to render the
    3D scene as a part of the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span>'s overall rendering
    process (which includes the 2D UI elements and effects). It
    also uses the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>'s information logging
    interfaces to log any errors encountered during the shadowing
    process. Finally the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> is used to access the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">Soldier</span>, the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> and the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span>. </li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">Soldier</span>: Owing to the
    fact that the camera is relative to the Soldier's position
    and heading, the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> uses the Soldier
    object in several instances. During startup, the Soldier is
    queried to determine the initial heading of the camera, as
    well as the fixed height-offset of the soldier's eyes from
    his feet (which are his origin). The Soldier's scene graph
    root position is used each frame to slide the automap texture
    in such a way that it matches the Soldier's location in the
    scene. One other bit of coupling is implicit the camera
    itself is attached to a child of the Soldier's root node,
    meaning that the camera automatically transforms with the
    character's root.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> is used to
    ensure that the camera does not "clip" through the terrain. 
    Height values returned by the terrain manager are used to
    artificially raise the camera to avoid any clipping below the
    terrain. This does not ensure that the character is visible
    from the camera location (a bump in the terrain between the
    camera and the character will not be detected), but it does
    ensure that the camera does not end up in a "backstage"
    region.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> uses the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span> for one
    special effect: lens flare. The <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span> is called with the
    five rays from viewer to the sun position, checking if the
    scene occludes the rays. These occlusion results are used to
    attenuate or even disable the lens flare effect. The more
    rays that are occluded, the more the effect is attenuated. 
    Each occluded ray deducts 20% of the original brightness, so
    that if all rays are occluded, the flare is disabled.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ShadowGeometry</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry</span> class
supports automatic, projected shadows. The class includes the
ability to generate the shadow image each frame from a set of
"caster" geometry. The class also supports projection of the
shadow onto a set of "recipient" geometry, culling pieces of
geometry that do not need to receive the shadow. This creates a
high-quality, high-performance shadow effect with minimal
application-level code. For an alternative shadowing technique,
please refer to the <a href=
"../../Programmer/Shadowing_System/Introduction_to_the_Shadowing_System.htm">
Gamebryo Shadowing System</a>.</p>

<p>The basic pieces of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry</span> object are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A shadow texture rendered each frame from a set of caster
    geometry. This demo uses a complex and expensive, but
    accurate, rendered shadow. This allows the shadow to change
    as the caster moves and articulates, particularly important
    when the caster geometry is a deformable, skinned
    character.</li>

    <li>A shadow camera, which represents the projection of the
    shadow into the scene. Conceptually, this is a sort of
    "reverse projection", as we are projecting a 2D image (the
    shadow texture) into a 3D scene. However, the actual
    operation really involves determining which triangles fall
    within the camera's frustum, and then projecting those
    triangles onto the camera's projection plane, which is
    equivalent to the 2D texture space. This camera actually
    represents the light source, and is a distant perspective
    camera with a narrow FOV, simulating a parallel camera.</li>

    <li>A set of recipient geometry, upon which the shadow is to
    be cast. The system builds its own (dynamic) <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span> each
    frame by determining which triangles in the recipient
    geometry objects fall in the view frustum of the shadow
    camera. Each triangle that falls (even partially) within the
    shadow camera's view frustum is copied (with a slight offset
    to avoid z-fighting) into the shadow recipient <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span>. The
    vertices of this <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span> are
    then assigned texture UVs based on the shadow camera.</li>
</ul>

<p>The application must draw the shadow geometry <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span> (which may
be queried using <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry::GetShadowGeometry</span>) on top
of (after) the recipient geometry object. The renderstate on the
shadow geometry object will cause it to be rendered with the
shadow texture applied and multiplicative alpha blending enabled
(to make the shadow object darken the scene in the shadowed
area).</p>

<p>In addition, if the application must call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry::Click</span> every frame to
update both the shadow texture (if it is projected) and the
recipient geometry object.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry</span> depends upon
several of the other support classes in the application for
specific features:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> object is
    used to query the world-space direction of the light, which
    is assumed to be casting the shadow. <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry</span> also uses the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>'s information
    logging interfaces to log any errors encountered during the
    shadowing process. Finally, the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> is used to access the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span>
    object.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span>: Is
    used in several places to determine the geometry upon which
    the shadow is cast. The terrain is picked in order to locate
    a center of the projected shadow volume, and the terrain
    objects and triangles are tested against the shadow camera
    clipping planes. Geometry from the terrain manager that is
    found to fall within the shadow camera's frustum is added to
    the list of recipient geometry in each frame.</li>
</ul>
