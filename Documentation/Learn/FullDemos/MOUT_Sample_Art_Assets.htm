<h1>MOUT Sample Art Assets</h1>

<p>The source data files for the assets used in MOUT can be found
in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Art Files</span> subfolder of
the MOUT sample. Three main datasets were created for MOUT: the
character file, <span class="NDLSystemFont">Soldier.max</span>,
the scene file, <span class="NDLSystemFont">DT.max</span>, and
the sky, <span class="NDLSystemFont">skydome.max</span>.</p>

<h2>The Character</h2>

<h3>Rigging</h3>

<p>The soldier character was rigged to the standard Character
Studio Biped. A Skin modifier was used on the soldier mesh
instead of the Physique modifier because Skin is more stable and
simpler to set up in Max. The default settings were used when
setting up the character's skin.</p>

<h3>Texturing</h3>

<p>The soldier's material was set to a "<a href=
"../../Art/Max/Multi_Sub_Object_Materials_and_Shell_Materials.htm">
multi-sub</a>" material with three sub-materials; one each for
the body, head, and goggles. The goggles required their own
sub-material due to the fact that the goggles required an alpha
channel in the texture map. The maps used for the body and head
were 512x512 pixels each; both were 24 bits per pixel. The
goggle texture was 128x256 pixels at 32 bits per pixel. When
creating real-time datasets, it is important to minimize the
number of distinct textures applied to any object. Each
independent texture becomes a separate mesh in the runtime
dataset, even if multiple textures are a part of the same overall
multi-sub material. </p>

<p>Minimizing total object count is important to runtime
performance, especially when creating character datasets to be
rendered on consumer-level DirectX based hardware.</p>

<h3>Animation</h3>

<p>The character animations consist of a set of independent
loops: a walk cycle, a run cycle, and several idle cycles. These
loops were marked as sequences in 3ds Max using the Gamebryo
Animation Manager. In order to facilitate smooth morphing
between walk and run cycles, sequence tags were added to the
animation tracks. This allows the system to synchronize the
footfalls when transitioning between the run and walk cycles.
Text tags called .left' and .right' were created at each footfall
for the left and right feet (respectively) in both the run and
walk cycles. (These can be set under the Sequence Tags rollout of
the Gamebryo <a href=
"../../Art/Max/Introduction_!Animation_Manager.htm">Animation
Manager Utility</a> in 3ds Max.)</p>

<p>Having exported the character, it was loaded into the <a href=
"../../Tools/animation_tool/Introduction_to_Animation_Tool.htm">Animation
Tool</a> to create the KFM file. The KFM file was adjusted to
recognize the aforementioned .left' and .right' text keys,
stretching the animations in time during transitions so that
footfalls would always match up. These settings can be adjusted
using the <a href=
"../../Tools/animation_tool/Transition_View.htm">Transition
View</a> in the Gamebryo Animation Tool.</p>

<h2>The Scene</h2>

<h3>Hierarchy</h3>

<p>The file <span class="NDLSystemFont">DT.max</span> contains
the main scenery object, specifically the buildings and
landscape. The hierarchy in 3ds Max consists of five sibling
group objects, which exports to a Gamebryo scene graph with five
main nodes. Each of these nodes contains additional structures
beneath them, as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>"buildings": This node contains the geometry representing
    all of the town buildings. All objects under this node
    support an "x-ray" mode, which is used to make the buildings
    transparent when they block the camera's view of the soldier
    in the final application. This node contains only rendered
    geometry, with no additional collision information. The
    components of each building are grouped together into
    per-building group nodes. No multi-sub materials are used,
    ensuring that a flat hierarchy will appear under each
    building group. This is required by the application in order
    for the "x-ray" mode to operate properly.</li>

    <li>"collision": This node contains all of the invisible
    collision data. The collision objects were placed under a
    separate node to avoid having to traverse the entire scene
    graph at runtime in order to find the bounding boxes. In
    order for the collision system to parse the data properly,
    the geometric data for each collision box object is grouped
    under an individual group node.</li>

    <li>"effects": All of the special effects are grouped under
    this node, including the particle systems, morphing fire
    geometry, and water effects.</li>

    <li>"environment objects": This node contains all static town
    geometry that is not intended to be affected by the "x-ray"
    mode (i.e. static town objects other than buildings). Most
    importantly, this includes the terrain (or land)
    objects.</li>

    <li>"lights": Contains all lights that affect the scene.
    These lights are animated, changing color and brightness over
    time. The effect is quite subtle and may not be immediately
    apparent. </li>
</ul>

<p>One additional standalone node at the root of the 3ds Max file
is a dummy object called "start". This object's location and
orientation determine the initial placement of the soldier
character, as well as his initial orientation (the initial
character orientation is equal to the local space negative-Y
direction of this node in max).   </p>

<h3>Terrain</h3>

<p>The terrain geometry is contained in the "land" object. This
object is also the only one in the scene that uses a multi-sub
material. The object uses a custom shader, which was written to
blend between two textures based on the per-vertex alpha value of
the mesh to which it is applied. This custom shader is called
"VCAlphaTextureBlender", and can be found under the "<a href=
"../../Art/Max/Custom_Shader_Sub_Panel.htm">Custom Shader</a>"
drop-down in the Gamebryo <a href=
"../../Art/Max/Materials_Introduction.htm">Material panel</a> in
3ds Max. With this shader, an alpha value of 100 will cause the
shader to use the texture loaded in slot 1 of the shader's
<a href=
"../../Art/Max/Custom_Attributes_For_your_Custom_Shaders.htm">custom
attributes</a>, while an alpha value of 0 will cause the shader
to use the texture in slot two. Alpha values between 1 and 99
will blend between these two textures proportionally. Each of
these two textures has its own UVW coordinates, allowing the
textures to be mapped completely independent of one another. In
addition, a third independent map (a detail map) is applied over
the entire surface.</p>

<p>The shader uses the per-vertex alpha values to blend the
textures in order to avoid having to use the vertex colors for
the same purpose. The scene contains static vertex colors to
create the effect of varying lighting and color across the
terrain. Owing to the fact that the terrain required more then
two distinct textures across its surface, the terrain was split
into a multi-sub material. Each sub-material uses the
VCAlphaTextureBlender with the image <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">dirt01.dds</span> in the first slot (as the
common "base" texture), while the second texture of each
sub-material varies depending on the terrain area. The vertex
alpha values were set to 100 along the edges of abutting
multi-sub materials (material ID's), causing the common dirt
texture to be drawn on either side of the shared edge. This
causes the edges of the multi-sub materials to be almost
completely invisible.</p>

<p>Note that this Gamebryo "shader" does <em>not</em> require
support for D3D Pixel or Vertex Shaders, and is an example of a
fixed-function shader. The Gamebryo shader in this case simply
replaces Gamebryo's standard rendering pipeline; it is capable of
running on 3D hardware cards that do not support Pixel and Vertex
Shaders.</p>

<h3>Buildings</h3>

<p>Each building contains several pieces; windows, doors, etc.
Each piece has its own texture, applied as a base map.
Additionally, the dark map slot is used to add additional "dirt"
or "noise" to the buildings (e.g. the texture <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">darknoise01-06.dds</span>.) In this dataset, the
dark map slot is <em>not</em> used for lighting (the standard use
of a darkmap), because static vertex colors were used to provide
any extra lighting and shadows as needed. The dark map is used to
apply dirt and noise textures, which were applied with different
UVW coordinates from those of the base maps. This minimizes the
obvious effects of repeating textures.</p>

<h3>Water</h3>

<p>The water effect is created using the combination of several
basic elements, none of which require custom shaders. These
elements include:</p>

<ol>
    <li>An environment map: The omni light called
    "EnvironmentMap01" is set to include the water mesh in its
    inclusion list. An environment map image is loaded under the
    omni's Shadow Parameters; thus, when exported, Gamebryo
    converts the light into a projected texture effect. The light
    had to be rotated along its local X-axis to tweak the viewing
    angle of the reflection.</li>

    <li>A flipbook (or animated) texture is used as a bumpmap.
    The animated effect consists of 31 textures, each a 64x64
    grayscale image (<span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">caust##.bmp</span>). These are placed in the
    bump map slot of the water material.</li>

    <li>Per-vertex alpha values are used to fade the water out
    along the riverbank; vertex colors are used to modulate the
    color of the water itself. A tiled UVW mapping of the bump
    map created quite a repetitive pattern, so an "unwrap"
    modifier was applied and the UVW coordinates were warped.
    This decreases the effect of the repeating pattern and
    creates the slight illusion of the water speeding up and
    slowing down in some sections of the river.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Lighting</h3>

<p>There are two main lights in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">DT.max</span> file; these are set to light the
entire scene. The first of these lights is an omni light, which
represents the sun. A dummy node is placed in the same position
as this light, and provides the direction for the projected
shadow on the soldier in the application itself. The second main
light is a directional light, added to provide some "cold"
backlighting. Both of these lights animate slightly over time in
both color and intensity.</p>

<p>Three smaller omni lights are placed in the scene to provide
dynamic lighting effects around the fire areas. In addition,
these lights serve to light up the smoke particle effects,
providing the effect of depth to the smoke clouds. These omni
lights are set to attenuate with increasing distance, and do not
affect the whole scene. The limits are set in the light dialog by
adjusting the far attenuation settings and setting the decay type
to "Inverse Square".</p>

<p>Static lighting was burned into the buildings and the terrain
by using the "Paint Vertex Colors" modifier in max. Additional
lights were set up, burned into all the meshes, and then deleted
from the Max file. Remaining lighting artifacts on several meshes
were touched-up with additional hand painting of the vertex
colors.</p>

<h2>Export</h2>

<p>The default Gamebryo Process Script was modified slightly
prior to exporting data sets for the MOUT Demo. The "<a href=
"../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Scene_Graph_Optimization.htm">Scene
Graph Optimization</a>" plug-in was set to disable the merging of
sibling nodes and to disable the merging of sibling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> objects that share the same
material. While these are normally very powerful optimizations,
the "x-ray" mode used in the application requires that each
building remains a separate group node.</p>

<p>In addition, the "Remove Extra Texture Coordinate Sets" was
also disabled, as the "x-ray" mode requires an additional UVW set
that is accessed directly by the application code (to display the
wire frame "x-ray" uniformly across each building). </p>

<p>Textures were exported internal to the NIF file, and were set
to remain as .Image Default' format. Most of the textures were
compressed into DDS files, as this format works well on
DirectX-based hardware.</p>

<h2>Diced Terrain Data</h2>

<p>The MOUT demo makes use of a quadtree version of the terrain
for picking and character shadow generation. The source art for
this process is a Max file containing only the terrain. The mesh
has a special <a href=
"../../Art/Max/Mesh_Profile_Custom_Attribute.htm">mesh
profile</a> applied to it that enabled a utility program, the
<a href="Mesh_Dicer_Tool.htm">Mesh Dicer</a> tool, to
execute.</p>

<p>The export process for the diced terrain begins with an export
script that leaves the mesh unchanged on export. The Mesh Dicer
tool is then run on the mesh to produce a diced version which is
loaded by the application.</p>
