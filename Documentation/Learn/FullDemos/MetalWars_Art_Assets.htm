<h1>MetalWars Art Assets</h1>

<p>3ds Max source files for all the assets used in the MetalWars
sample can be found in the Gamebryo install directory under
<em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Samples\GameDemos\MetalWars\Art
Files.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The MetalWars sample was designed to show the following
elements:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Implement advanced lighting

        <ul>
            <li>High Dynamic Range (HDR) light calculations and
            rendering</li>

            <li>Light the scene with cubemaps for per-pixel
            lighting control</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Unified shader for (almost) everything in the scene,
    including the characters and buildings.</li>

    <li>Real-time "post process" effects like depth-of-field,
    night-vision and heat shimmer.</li>

    <li>Advanced animation management including animation
    layering and blending of multiple animations to create the
    final pose of the character.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advanced Lighting</h2>

<p>MetalWars uses cubemaps as the primary light source. Using
cubemaps as the primary sources provided exact control of the
lighting. In addition, with cube maps having twelve "lights" is
no more expensive then one, so for complex and detailed lighting
it is a good choice. The cube-maps in MetalWars were static in
that they were rendered before runtime. They are in .hdr format
and thus will appear black inside of Max or any application that
does not support .hdr format.</p>

<p>The shader applied to objects in the scene and the robot finds
the closest two point lights and adds them to the lighting
result, thus allowing for dynamic light sources. One of the point
lights is always the light used for the blaster gun effect --
this allows for the scene to "blow-out" to white when the blaster
gun is fired based on dynamic lighting. The application code
parsed the scene and picked out what additional point light it
would use on buildings and props as a runtime pre-process. The
robot was updated every frame to find the closest point light to
it.</p>

<h2>Shader Breakdown</h2>

<p>The texture components of the shader that create the
overall results in the scene are as follows:</p>

<p>"Diffuse lighting.hdr" simulates the diffuse lighting of the
scene by projecting its values onto the geometry.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Smaller size and blurry to simulate "fuzzy" light
    bounces</li>

    <li>32 x 32 x 6</li>
</ul>

<p>"Specular lighting.hdr" simulates reflection and is added onto
the diffuse lighting value.</p>

<ul>
    <li>More detailed and larger to simulate a reflected surface
    or mirror</li>

    <li>128 x 128 x 6</li>
</ul>

<p>A gloss map was used to define reflective properties. The
diffuse and specular cube-map was filtered though a gloss map
with black representing diffuse and white representing pure
reflection. The resulting lighting was offset by a normal map to
provide extra geometric detail. Note that the gloss map was
actually stored in the alpha channel of the normal map to save an
extra lookup into another texture. Thus all normal maps are 32
bit .tgas and need alpha.</p>

<p>A Dark Map and vertex colors modulate the result to provide
extra light, shading, and detail on a per-object basis. A Glow
Map was used for self illumination. A multiplier on the shader
rollout determined the final overall brightness while the texture
map provided the detail color and intensity.</p>

<p>The shader used to define these attributes is
"GeneralDiffuseSpecular" which can be applied from the drop down
list of Gamebryo Shaders in Max or Maya. Entries to load the two
reflect/refract slots and the normal/gloss map slot can be found
under its attributes. This shader is written in the .fx HLSL
format.</p>

<p>The shader was generalized enough to cover 90% of the scene. A
few things were left using the default pipeline, mainly the fire
effects and the telephone wires as they were morph targets.</p>

<h2>Animation</h2>

<p>The character animations consist of a set of independent
loops: a walk cycle, a run cycle, and several idle cycles. These
loops were marked as sequences in 3ds Max using the Gamebryo
Animation Manager. In order to facilitate smooth morphing between
walk and run cycles, sequence tags were added to the animation
tracks. This allows the system to synchronize the footfalls when
transitioning between the run and walk cycles. Text tags called
"left" and "right" were created at each footfall for the left and
right feet, respectively, in both the run and walk cycles. (These
can be set under the Sequence Tags rollout of the Gamebryo
<a href=
"../../Art/Max/Introduction_!Animation_Manager.htm">Animation
Manager Utility</a> in 3ds Max.)</p>

<p>Having exported the character, it was loaded into the <a href=
"../../Tools/animation_tool/Introduction_to_Animation_Tool.htm">Animation
Tool</a> to create the KFM file. The KFM file automatically
recognized the aforementioned "left" and "right" text keys,
stretching the animations in time during transitions so that
footfalls would always match up. These settings can be adjusted
using the <a href=
"../../Tools/animation_tool/Transition_View.htm">Transition
View</a> in the Gamebryo Animation Tool.</p>

<p>Layering was also heavily utilized in MetalWars. For example,
looking around was achieved by blending two layers, "lookup" and
"lookdown" on top of an idle animation. This is also true for
firing when walking or running. Only one fire animation was
recorded and it was set as an upper body layer to take over the
torso while the legs play the walk or run animation.</p>

<p>All blending, timing, and layering information was setup with
the <a href=
"../../Tools/animation_tool/Introduction_to_Animation_Tool.htm">Animation
Tool</a> and saved as a Gamebryo .kfm file. The .kfm was accessed
by the code to call the specific animations and the blending
routines it stored. The file can be found under
<em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Samples\GameDemos\MetalWars\Data\Win32\Killbot.</p>

<h2>Hierarchy</h2>

<p>The file "scene.max" contains the demo's "set", in this case a
city block. The hierarchy in 3ds Max consists of nine sibling
branches containing objects, which exports to a Gamebryo scene
graph with nine main nodes. Each of these nodes contains
additional structures beneath them, as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>"buildings": This node contains the geometry representing
    the immediate buildings in the area. All objects under this
    node support a "see through" shader mode, which is used to
    make the buildings transparent when they block the camera's
    view of the robot. This node contains only the rendered
    geometry, with no additional collision information. The
    components of each building are grouped together into
    per-building group nodes. This way the application knows
    which building is in the way of the camera, and which to use
    for the "see through" effect.</li>

    <li>"collision": This node contains all of the invisible
    collision data. The collision objects were placed under a
    separate node to avoid having to traverse the entire scene
    graph at runtime in order to find the bounding boxes. In
    order for the collision system to parse the data properly,
    the geometric data for each collision box object is grouped
    under an individual group node.</li>

    <li>"effects": All of the special effects are grouped under
    this node, including the particle systems and the geometry
    flagged for the shimmer shader. Sub-node "Shimmer" was used
    to determine which objects were to be rendered with the
    shimmer effect.</li>

    <li>"environment objects": this node contained all ground
    objects, i.e. the street and sidewalks. The land was split
    into seven pieces so each would get the closest light and
    allow the ground to be illuminated by seven point (omni)
    lights.</li>

    <li>"lights": Contains all lights that affect the scene.
    These lights are animated, changing color and brightness over
    time. These are the lights that are dynamically assigned to
    the killbot's shader.</li>

    <li>"Skyline_buildings": contained all buildings on the
    horizon. These were processed as four or five objects, had no
    collision and were not assigned additional lights.</li>

    <li>One additional standalone node at the root of the 3ds Max
    file is a dummy object called "start". This object's location
    and orientation determine the initial placement of the
    character, as well as his initial orientation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Texture Creation</h2>

<p>HDR textures were created using 3ds Max, HDRShop and
Photogenics. Per-pixel adjustment of these maps was hard to do as
no paint programs supported HDR editing easily when the textures
were initially created. The cube-maps used for lighting were
completely synthetic and pre-rendered in Max and compiled into a
DirectX cubemap in .dds format.</p>

<p>The skydome textures are HDR as well, although they are stored
as 32-bit .tgas. This was done for space savings and for the
ability to better manipulate 32-bit images. The alpha channel was
used to multiply the values of the RGB channel. Making the
horizon bright enough that it bleeds into the buildings on the
skyline was done by using a close-to-white value in the alpha
channel. In addition the file name of the texture determined what
the exact multiplier was. Thus .sky01_hdr005.tga' had a
multiplier of 5x RGB for each level of grey in the alpha.</p>

<p>Most other textures were 32-bit. Normal map textures were
appended with an _N so they would be easy to identify. All normal
map textures also carried the gloss values in their respective
alpha channels.</p>

<h2>Export</h2>

<p>The default Gamebryo Process Script was modified slightly
prior to exporting datasets for MetalWars. The "Scene Graph
Optimization" plug-in was set to disable the merging of sibling
nodes and to disable the merging of sibling <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span></a> objects that share the same
material. While these are normally very powerful optimizations,
the "see through" shader mode used in the application requires
that each building remain a separate group node. Textures were
exported internal to the NIF files, and were set to remain as
"Image Default" format.</p>
