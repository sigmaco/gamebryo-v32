<h1>Lenguins on Ice Art Assets</h1>

<p>3ds Max source files for all the assets used in the Lenguins
on Ice sample can be found in the Gamebryo install directory
under <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Samples\GameDemos\LenguinsOnIce\Art
Files</span>.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The Lenguins on Ice sample was designed to show the following
elements:</p>

<ul>
    <li>PhysX integration</li>

    <li>Advanced rendering effects

        <ul>
            <li>Fully skinned and animated shells and fins fur
            rendering.</li>

            <li>Reflect and refract shader simulating ray
            tracing.</li>

            <li>Heat shimmer effect used to for 'Cold
            Distortion'</li>

            <li>Terrain with sparkling snow</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Advanced Rendering</h2>

<p>The fur applied to the lenguins uses the standard shells and
fins rendering technique. To generate the required shell
geometry, a specialized export process plug-in for 3ds max was
created: the <a href=
"../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Fur_Generator.htm">Fur Generator
plug-in</a>. For each Lenguin, there are nine shells, each with
its own parameters for distance-based rendering, as a customized
LOD-like approach. During the export process, a texture atlas is
generated that is used to represent the fur for the shells. Each
cell in the atlas is referenced by one shell level in the shell
geometry. In this way, all the shells may be rendered with the
same texture in one draw call. The fin geometry is also generated
in the export plug-in, although it has only one detail level, and
the texture used for the fins is supplied externally.</p>

<p>All whole ice blocks in the scene are rendered using a
customized shader. The shader takes in a base map, normal map,
alpha map, environment map, and texture containing the current
contents of the frame buffer. The normal map in this shader has
three separate purposes. First, it is used to compute the
reflection vector that is used to sample the environment map to
get the reflected color. Next, it is used to compute the fresnel
factor, which is used to determine ratio between reflection and
refraction. Lastly, it used as an offset when looking up the
color to refract from the frame buffer.</p>

<p>The cold distortion effect that is applied above each geyser
uses a heat shimmer effect. A texture containing the current
contents of the frame buffer, along with an offset map, are
passed into the shader. The offset map is used to distort or
offset the texel that is looked up from the frame buffer texture.
This simple approach of altering the locations from which the
frame buffer texture is sampled generates the heat shimmer
effect.</p>

<p>The shader used on the terrain in this sample uses the alpha
channel of the provided vertex color to blend between normal
mapped snow and normal mapped rock. A noise texture is sampled to
determine the amount of specular highlight to apply to the snow.
This noise texture is purposely not mip-mapped, so that when it
is sampled, the input will appear speckled. Having a speckled
input for the specular highlight coefficient results in the snow
appearing to sparkle as the camera is moved around.</p>

<h2>Hierarchy</h2>

<p>The file "level.max" contains the demo's "dataset". The
hierarchy in 3ds Max consists of four sibling branches containing
objects, which exports to a Gamebryo scene graph with nine main
nodes. Each of these nodes contains additional structures
beneath them, as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>"animation": This node contains all the geometry in the
    level that needs to be animated, excluding the camera. This
    includes the light for the scene, the snow falling from the
    sky, and the snow falling off the edge of the cliff. While
    the geysers' heat shimmer effect is animated, they are
    animated through a shader, so they do not need to be included
    in this list. Having all the animated objects under one node
    provides a simple way of updating all objects in the scene
    that need to be animated without having to waste CPU time
    updating objects that remain static through out the
    demo.</li>

    <li>"camera": This node contains the animated camera for the
    demo. The camera's location and direction are updated every
    frame at the start of the demo to provide an intro animation
    before the game starts.</li>

    <li>"level": This node contains all the static geometry that
    makes up the level. Because we know this geometry is static,
    we only have to perform one initial update on the node, and
    then we never need to update it again. This node is also used
    to help with the order in which objects are rendered.</li>

    <li>"tree": This node contains a list of sub-nodes, each one
    containing geometry information for a tree as well as PhysX
    information. When the level is loaded, the PhysX data is
    pulled out and used in the master PhysX scene so other
    objects can interact with the trees.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rendering Order</h2>

<p>To ensure that the heat shimmer does not affect the lenguins,
ice blocks, or trees, and to allow ice blocks to refract all
objects, the nodes listed above are used to control the order in
which objects are rendered. First, the sky dome (loaded
separately), the "level" node, and the "animation" node are
rendered. Afterwards, we render the heat shimmer effects, since
all objects to which we wish to apply a heat shimmer have now
been rendered. Finally, all the remaining objects (lenguins, ice
blocks, and trees) are rendered using the EffectAccumulator. The
EffectAccumulator will immediately render any object that does
not have an alpha property or a specialized shader applied to it.
Objects with these properties applied to them will be sorted in
back to front order and then rendered. This approach enables the
IceCube shader to refract all objects behind it.</p>

<h2>Export</h2>

<p>The default Gamebryo Process Script was modified slightly
prior to exporting datasets for Lenguins on Ice. The <a href=
"../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Fur_Generator.htm">plug-in</a> for
generating fur was added to the process script when exporting the
lenguins. For all objects containing PhysX data, a PhysX export
script was used, which includes a plug-in for exporting PhysX
data.</p>

<h2>Terrain Mesh Partitioning for Projected Shadows</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"Mesh_Dicer_Tool.htm">Mesh Dicer</a></span> is a spatial
partitioning tool primarily used to optimize the efficiency of
host-based operations, such as picking or projected shadows, on
relatively simple terrain meshes. This tool is used in Lenguins
on Ice to optimize the simplified terrain model (Arena-Diced.Nif)
used for projected shadow generation in Lenguins on Ice.</p>

<p>Prior to running the Mesh Dicer tool, Arena-Diced.nif is
exported using mesh profile LenguinsOnIce_MeshProfile.xml,
without GPU_READ being set, for optimal run-time performance for
the sample. Thus, that asset will not be visible "as is" when
loaded into AssetViewer.</p>
