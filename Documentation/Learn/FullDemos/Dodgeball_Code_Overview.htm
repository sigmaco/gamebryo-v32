<h1>Dodgeball Code Overview</h1>

<p>In this section we review the important classes that make up
the Dodgeball sample.</p>

<h2>The DodgeBall Class</h2>

<p>The top-level application class is derived from Gamebryo's
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiSample/Introduction_To_NiSample.htm">NiSample</a></span>
class. It is primarily responsible for three areas of
functionality:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Initialization:</b> The Dodgeball class initializes
    the basic application and all of the other classes. It
    creates the custom UI system and initializes the PhysX SDK
    object. Initialization is done in this class because it is
    the central starting point for the application.</li>

    <li><b>UI and Game State Management:</b> The Dodgeball class
    manages the current game and UI state, such as which splash
    screen is up or whether the game is in play. It also manages
    the custom UI created for the splash screens and handles
    input. We put UI functionality in this class because it has
    top-level control of the application and contains the access
    to inherited <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSample</span>
    functions.</li>

    <li><b>Update:</b> The basic per-frame update code is
    contained in the Dodgeball class, although virtually all the
    work of update is inherited from the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSample</span> class or done by the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">PlaygroundManager</span> object.
    Update is done here because this class is derived from the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSample</span> class and can
    inherit functionality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>UI Manager Classes</h2>

<p>Dodgeball implements a custom UI built on top of <a href=
"../../Reference/NiUserInterface/NiUserInterface_Introduction.htm">
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiUserInterface</span></a> classes.
The custom UI is designed to display the splash screens and
buttons (the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CustomUIGroup</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CustomButton</span> classes). It is
also responsible for the camera navigation system (the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNavCustomController</span> class)
and hence the interpretation of all user input.</p>

<h2>Playground Manager</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">PlaygroundManager</span> class
performs most of the work in dealing with the game environment,
and it also manages the character and cannons. Its functionality
can be broken into 3 areas:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Playground management:</b> The <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">PlaygroundManager</span> class is responsible
    for loading the playground art assets and providing
    information about them, such as the playable area and the
    locations of cannon mount points.</li>

    <li><b>PhysX Scene Management:</b> The <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">PlaygroundManager</span> object creates and
    owns the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span>
    object and is hence the primary contact point for the PhysX
    scene. In a step that comes post initialization (when all
    PhysX content has been created) it sets up a contact reporter
    so that the application knows about collisions. This
    information is restricted to collisions between the ball and
    the character using the actor group information.</li>

    <li><b>Update:</b> The update functionality is broken into
    two pieces in order to facilitate asynchronous physics
    simulation and to enforce the requirement that no input be
    given to the physics system while it is simulating. The
    pre-input update fetches simulation results that were begun
    in the previous frame and pushes any results to the Gamebryo
    scene graph. Note the use of the previous frame time as the
    time for which results are requested. User input and
    processing is done now, while simulation is known to be
    stopped. The post-update function updates all the other
    objects with the current time before re-starting
    simulation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cannon and Ball Management</h2>

<p>The cannons and balls are managed by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CannonManager</span> class and the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Cannon</span> class. The latter deals with
targeting the cannon - setting its pose to follow the character
while it is targeting to fire. Its <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> function returns true when the
cannon is in a position to fire.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CannonManager</span> is
responsible for loading the art assets for both the cannon and
the ball. The cannons are cloned to create one for each mount
point. Twenty ball clones are created at initialization so that
they are available immediately to avoid frame stutter when a
cannon fires. We know the number of balls we need because the
application resets after a fixed number.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> for the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CannonManager</span> class updates each cannon in
turn. If the cannon indicates that it should fire, and we don't
reset, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShootBall</span> function
is called to take a ball from the list of inactive balls, set its
pose to match the cannon's orientation, and set it in motion.
Here we make use of the ability to add and remove <a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXProp.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXProp</span></a> objects to and from an
<a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span></a> object. Creation and
deletion of the prop in the PhysX scene is automatically handled.
The ball is also added to the scene graph.</p>

<h2>Character Management</h2>

<p>The character in Dodgeball, Slim, is both an animated
character and a physics rag-doll. Most of the work in setting
Slim up to use both animation and physics was done in the art
tools (see <a href="Dodgeball_Art_Assets.htm">Dodgeball Art
Assets</a>), but some run-time set-up is also required. All the
code for managing the character is in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">TargetManager</span> class.</p>

<p>Slim has a physics sequence assigned. When Slim is loaded
(note the ordering of function calls in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">TargetManager::LoadActor</span> to ensure correct
loading) we create a <a href=
"../../Programmer/NiPhysX/Mixing_Animation_and_Physics_in_Gamebryo.htm">
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXSequenceManager</span></a>
object to manage transitions between physics and animations. And
we specify the physical sequence:</p>
<pre>
    m_spActorPhysX = NiNew NiPhysXSequenceManager;
    m_spActorPhysX-&gt;SetManager(pkCtrlMgr, m_spActorProp);
    m_spActorPhysX-&gt;MakeSequencePhysical(
        m_spActorManager-&gt;GetSequenceData(SLIM_Anim::PHYSX01));
</pre>

<p>With the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXSequenceManager</span> in place, the actor
manager can be used to transition to and from physics without any
special handling. However, the exact time when physics is
activated depends on the transition settings, so we set up
callbacks so that we can track when physics is activated. The
information is important for force application: forces should
only be applied to a dynamic actor, but the character is
kinematic when it is controlled by a key-sequence. The callbacks
on the "get-up" animations are used to prevent the cannons from
firing when the character is unable to run away.</p>

<p>The character can be in any one of three states:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Demo Mode:</b> If there is no user input, Slim
    randomly chooses a point in the playground and uses greedy
    search to try to run there. When Slim gets near the goal, he
    pauses and then chooses a new goal. Demo mode ends when Slim
    is hit by a ball (in which case he goes physical) or when the
    player provides some input, in which case Slim becomes player
    controlled.</li>

    <li><b>Player Controlled:</b> In this mode Slim is controlled
    by the input system. The code determines the reference frame
    for input (the camera frame) and the direction Slim is
    facing. Based on the input, a new target animation is
    selected to move Slim in the desired direction. There is
    special handling of situations when Slim gets too close to a
    boundary of the playground and his shocked stop animation is
    played.</li>

    <li><b>Physics controlled:</b> When Slim is under physics
    control the application must manage the forces applied to
    Slim and keep track of when Slim should get up again. When
    applying forces from the ball impact we must buffer the
    forces. There are three reasons for this: PhysX requires that
    information obtained from a contact report not be used to
    modify the scene until after the simulation step has
    completed; when Slim is first hit he is kinematic (animation
    controlled) and hence does not respond to the impact force;
    and we wish to modify the forces to exaggerate the hit.
    Hence, forces are queued when the contact report function is
    called (via <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">TargetManager::ProcessHit</span>) and removed
    from the queue in the update function for physics mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">TargetManager::Update</span>
function keeps track of which sequence is active and calls the
appropriate update procedure.</p>
