<h1>Metal Wars Code Overview</h1>

<p>The Metal Wars source code is divided into several files
constituting the application's C++ classes. Each class is
contained within source files (.h and .cpp) of the same name. The
purpose of the following descriptions is to give developers a
brief idea of the way that the collection of classes in Metal
Wars work together to provide overall functionality. For this
reason, the dependency listings for each class should be of high
interest.</p>

<h2>MetalWars</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">MetalWars</span> is the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiApplication/Introduction_to_NiApplication.htm">
NiApplication</a>-</span>derived class for the Metal Wars
application. The specific interfaces it relies on from
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span> are for
initialization (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MetalWars::Initialize</span>), shutdown
(<span class="NDLSystemFont">MetalWars::Terminate</span> ),
renderer and scene creation (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MetalWars::CreateRenderer</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MetalWars::CreateScene</span>), and rendering
(<span class="NDLSystemFont">MetalWars::OnIdle</span>).</p>

<p>Somewhat unique to the Metal Wars sample (relative to other
Gamebryo sample applications) is the fact that little of the real
work done in the application is maintained in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MetalWars</span> class itself. As such, and in
addition to its dependency on <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiApplication/Introduction_to_NiApplication.htm">
NiApplication</a></span>, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MetalWars</span> class is dependent on the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ShaderHelper</span> classes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>: The
    world creation and data loading occurs in <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> (and its dependent
    classes). This can be seen directly in <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">MetalWars::CreateScene</span> where the only
    work done is the creation of the single <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> and execution of the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> method that
    handles "world loading" (<span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::LoadWorld</span>). Similarly,
    the idle time processing of directly in <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">MetalWars::OnIdle</span> is limited in code
    scope. Most of the real application work is done through a
    call to <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::Update</span>.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderHelper</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">MetalWars</span> class maintains
    the application instance of the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ShaderHelper</span> class, which is used to
    initialize and load shaders into the Gamebryo Shader system.
    This class is much like similarly-named classes used in other
    Gamebryo demos, such as MOUT. The class loads the required
    shader libraries to read and parse the shader files (the HLSL
    FX shader parser in this case).</li>
</ul>

<h2>BipedCharacter</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">BipedCharacter</span> provides the
basis for a character class that can be used in applications that
require an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm">NiActorManager</a></span>
driven character. It is used in MetalWars as a base for the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Killbot</span> class. It includes
support for a rendered texture shadow, random idle animations,
various base-level data access methods, and several pure-virtual
interfaces for methods that handle drawing and locomotion.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">BipedCharacter</span> is dependent
on three other application classes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry</span>:
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">BipedCharacter</span> maintains
    an instance of <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry</span> for giving the
    character a rendered shadow. <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">BipedCharacter</span> has the interfaces for
    application access to shadow texture and shadow geometry
    rendering.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>:
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> debugging
    interfaces are used by <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">BipedCharacter</span>.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span>: The
    terrain manager is accessed solely to transfer the ground
    object maintained by the terrain manager into the character's
    shadow manager (which will apply shadow geometry upon
    it).</li>
</ul>

<h2>BlasterManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">BlasterManager</span> handles all
effects related to gunfire. It manages both the projectile and
its movement, and also the "blow-out" point light that exploits
the HDR adaptation system used in Metal Wars to black-out the
screen temporarily. Upon projectile impact and explosion, the
blaster's point light is used to quickly drive lighting levels in
the scene to very large values, thereby causing the sample's HDR
systems to adjust for the very brief burst of high scene
luminance. For a few seconds post-explosion, the user can see the
HDR system re-adapt (much like the human eye, which it mimics) to
more typical lighting conditions. The warp effect that is created
with the projectile explosion is rendered using the same system
as the heat-shimmer effects from the fire sources in the scene.
The blaster simply registers an additional geometry object (a
sphere) as rendering to the buffer that adds shimmer offsets.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">BlasterManager</span> depends
on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span>: The
    CollisionManager is used for intersection testing of the
    projectile with the scene, including the terrain.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">Killbot</span>: The Killbot
    is used (indirectly) to query the launch point for the
    blaster projectile. The Killbot is lit by the blaster point
    light. The killbot also includes a callback for a text key
    event (the gun firing event) that causes the blaster to
    fire.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">MRTShadersEffect</span>: This
    class accesses the blaster object to draw the projectile into
    the shimmer buffer that generates the warp effect when the
    projectile is in flight and exploding. WorldManager: The
    WorldManager creates the BlasterManager and also updates it
    every frame.</li>
</ul>

<h2>CameraController</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> class
implements a form of "smart camera". The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> adds numerous features
beyond a standard Gamebryo camera and hides implementation
details from other parts of the application. It is close to
identical to the <a href=
"MOUT_Sample_Code_Overview.htm">CameraController</a> from the
MOUT GameDemo, and also adds control to Metal Wars for managing
the killbot's HUD system.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> depends
upon several of the other support classes in the application for
specific features:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> uses the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> to render the
    3D scene as a part of the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span>'s overall rendering
    process (which includes the 2D UI elements and effects). It
    also uses the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>'s information logging
    interfaces to log any errors encountered during the shadowing
    process. Finally the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> is used to access the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">Killbot</span>, the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> and the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span>.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">Killbot</span>: Owing to the
    fact that the camera is relative to the Killbot's position
    and heading, the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> uses the Killbot
    object in several instances. During startup, the Killbot is
    queried to determine the initial heading of the camera, as
    well as the fixed height-offset of his eyes from his feet
    (which are his origin). The Killbot's scene graph root
    position is used each frame to slide the automap texture in
    such a way that it matches the Killbot's location in the
    scene. One other bit of coupling is implicit - the camera
    itself is attached to a child of the Killbot's root node,
    meaning that the camera automatically transforms with the
    character's root.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> is used to
    ensure that the camera does not "clip" through the terrain.
    Height values returned by the terrain manager are used to
    artificially raise the camera to avoid any clipping below the
    terrain. This does not ensure that the character is visible
    from the camera location (a bump in the terrain between the
    camera and the character will not be detected), but it does
    assume that the camera does not end up in a "backstage"
    region.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">MRTShadersEffect</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">MRTShadersEffect</span> class is
    accessed during camera idle mode operations and when the
    Killbot is in first person mode to manage the current HUD
    mode.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">MenuManager:</span>The camera
    controller creates and manages the menu system, if it is
    created.</li>
</ul>

<h2>CollisionManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span> handles
scene level picking and collision interactions. It is used by the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Killbot</span> class for determining
if there are character-to-building collision intersections, as
determined by the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Introduction_to_Collision.htm">NiCollision</a></span>
system. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Killbot</span> uses
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span> for ray
intersection (picking via <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/NiPick.htm">NiPick</a></span>)
purposes with the buildings in the scene to determine if any
given building obstructs the view of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Killbot</span>.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span> is
dependent on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">Killbot</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span> accesses
    a collision record maintained as a member of the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Killbot</span> record, when collisions are
    detected, is used to hold information about the intersection
    that occurred including things like time of collisions,
    intersection points and normals.</li>

    <li>WorldManager: The world manager is used for debugging
    output, as well as for querying the killbot when setting up
    character-scene collisions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>HDRScene</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">HDRScene</span> handles all
operations of generating effects for "HDR lighting" in the Metal
Wars demo. Specifically, it performs a sequence of steps to
calculate an average scene luminance. This value is then used to
perform a bright pass filter on the rendered scene to control
what in the image will generate "blooms". The "blooms" are then
created by successive blurring operations done on the bright pass
results. Additionally, the active luminance value incorporates an
adaptation control to "smooth" the active luminance over several
frames and prevent jarring jumps in brightness in the scene. This
adaptation is done to mimic the human eye adaptation to bright
sources. Input to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">HDRScene</span>
code comes from the floating point render target to which the 3D
scene was rendered. This target encodes large lighting values
from light sources that have large multipliers or cubemaps that
use HDR textures as their representation. In Metal Wars, HDR
diffuse and specular cube maps form part of the lighting in the
scene. Output from the HDR operations is fed to a set of
potentially-enabled MRT-based effects. The shaders used by the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">HDRScene</span> class can be found in
<span class="NDLSystemFont">HDRScene.fx</span>.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">HDRScene</span> is dependent
on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>: The HDR
    scene depends on output from the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> scene drawing operations,
    which are assumed to be rendered into a floating-point color
    buffer that can be used as a texture.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">PostProcessManager:</span>
    The <span class="NDLSystemFont">PostProcessManager</span>
    manages the state of the HDR effects system and its
    operation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The code and associated shaders of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">HDRScene</span> are based on concepts from the
Microsoft DirectX 9 "HDRLighting" sample. Documentation for that
sample may be found in the Microsoft "DirectX Documentation for
C++" (shipped with the DX9 SDK) by searching for
"HDRLighting".</p>

<h2>Killbot</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Killbot</span> provides
specialized, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MetalWars</span>-specific behavior to the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">BipedCharacter</span> base class,
including input-based transform updating, drawing, and code to
determine if the Killbot is obscured in the camera view by
buildings.</p>

<p>Much of the details of the operation of this class is
specified in inline source comments for <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Killbot</span>. Of particular interest might be
<span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateCollisionBasedPosition</span>,
which is used to determine if movement for the character is valid
relative to collisions with buildings, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CheckForBlockedCameraView</span>, which
determines if buildings obscure the camera's view of the
character.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Killbot</span> class is
dependent on the following other MetalWars application
classes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">BlasterManager</span>: The
    killbot includes code to launch the blaster effect inside of
    one of its animation callbacks. The callback for the text key
    "<span class="NDLSystemFont">morph: fire_begin</span>" causes
    the blaster to fire. In this way, the animation system
    automatically launches the blaster effect at the appropriate
    time. In addition, before allowing the killbot's firing
    animation to even be triggered, the killbot code checks to
    see if the blaster can be fired (i.e. a blaster "bolt" is not
    already in flight).</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> is
    accessed in the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">UpdateBipedRootTransforms</span> function to
    obtain the current input values for setting the character's
    world rotation. The current camera pitch and yaw values are
    used in <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">AdjustSequenceWeights</span> to set the
    blending values for the gun firing animations. This allows
    the character to fire the gun upward and downward.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span>: This
    application class is used by the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Killbot</span> in two different ways. First,
    the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span>
    provides access to collision detection routines for
    determining intersections with the MetalWars scene's
    buildings. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Killbot</span>
    uses the <a href=
    "../../Reference/NiCollision/Introduction_to_Collision.htm"><span class="NDLSystemFont">
    NiCollision</span></a> system with both static and dynamic
    (velocity-based) collision to determine if movements are safe
    without causing building intersections (including sliding
    behavior) in <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">UpdateCollisionBasedPosition</span>.
    Additionally, the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">CollisionManager</span> provides interfaces
    for the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Killbot</span> to use the
    <a href="../../Reference/NiCollision/NiPick.htm"><span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiPick</span></a> system to determine if any
    buildings are blocking the camera view of the character in
    <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">CheckForBlockedCameraView</span>.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> is used to
    ground the soldier on the terrain both during initialization
    (<span class="NDLSystemFont">Initialize</span>) and run-time
    updating of the character's position (<span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">UpdateCollisionBasedPosition</span>).</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> is used for
    global access of its sub-managers as well as debug logging.
    Additionally, its <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">SetAsKillbotBlocker</span> function is used
    by the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Killbot::CheckForBlockedCameraView</span>
    function to mark buildings as camera-blockers. It uses a
    world manager function (<span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">LightObject</span>) to assign the closest
    lights to affect the killbot each frame.</li>
</ul>

<h2>MRTShadersEffect</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">MRTShadersEffect</span> provides a
layer built on <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PostProcessEffect</span> to manage all
full-screen post processing effects, several of which rely on
multiple render targets (MRTs) for operation. The inputs to these
shader-based effects are provided by a pair of buffer outputs
from the single 3D scene rendering operation; a
surface-normal/depth texture, as well as the standard rendered
color buffer. Output of each is a fullscreen polygon rendered
with whatever effects are active. The system "ping-pongs" the
effects between a set of screen-sized color buffers, with each
effect using the last rendered buffer as a texture and rendering
to the other buffer. Most of the effects in this part of the
system operate using variations of the same basic techniques.</p>

<p>The general scene shaders (found in GeneralDiffuseSpecular.fx)
write necessary data to MRT buffers for later use by the
MRT-based effects controlled by this class. The shaders used by
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">MRTShadersEffect</span> class can
be found in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MRTShadersEffect.fx</span>. In all cases, the
vertex shader simply outputs transformed vertex positions of the
full-screen polygon being drawn for the effect. The interesting
work for each effect is done in the pixel shaders.</p>

<p>The MRT-based effects the demo uses include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Heat Shimmer&mdash;The heat shimmer effect is always
    active in the demo (unless disabled via the debugging menu).
    Shimmer producing objects (the fire-sourced heat waves and
    the blaster projectile) are rendered to a unique render
    target buffer, called the "shimmer buffer". This buffer is
    then used as a lookup mask to determine where to apply
    shimmer. The resulting color from this lookup is interpreted
    as texture coordinate offsets - they are added per-pixel to a
    set of UVs that do a 1-to-1 mapping of the buffer containing
    the rendered scene. In this way, the red and green channels
    in the shimmer buffer serve to jitter or shimmer an otherwise
    direct mapping of the rendered scene image to the screen. The
    red and green channels of the shimmer buffer represent signed
    shifts in screen space. If the entire shimmer buffer is 50%
    yellow, then the offsets will be zero at every pixel, and
    there will appear to be no shimmer effect. As red and green
    channels diverge from these "zero" values (lower meaning a
    negative offset and higher meaning a positive offset), then
    the lookup into the rendered scene texture for a given pixel
    will be shifted up, do, left or right accordingly, creating
    an effect that looks like light refraction.</li>

    <li>Depth of Field&mdash;This effect is used when the camera
    is in idle mode and focusing on the killbot. Using the
    distance/depth data retained from the original rendering of
    the scene in an MRT, pixels beyond a specified distance are
    faded between the original rendering and a blurred version
    (blurred smoothly using a standard Gaussian blurring
    operations) based on depth. Thus, as the pixels recede into
    the distance, they become increasingly blurrier. Like most of
    the pixel-shader based blurring techniques used in Metal
    Wars, the overall blur is actually done with two separate
    operations, one to blur the image in the X dimension of the
    screen and then another to blur in the Y dimension.</li>

    <li>Night Vision&mdash;The night vision effect is one of the
    killbot's "Heads Up Display" ;modes. The effect converts the
    rendered scene buffer's color to a luminance value via a dot
    product between the scene buffer's color and a constant
    luminance vector to create the monochromatic-looking night
    vision result. It uses a rendered texture version of the
    killbot's HUD as the lookup mask for the effect. If a pixel
    is in the masked area of the HUD (determined by the presence
    of any color in the mask lookup), it uses a blue tinted
    luminance translation vector and only the color translation
    itself is done on the pixel. If the pixel outside the HUD
    center area, a different luminance vector is used and a blur
    is also performed. As a final step, noise is added to all
    pixels.</li>

    <li>Edge Detection&mdash;As one of the killbot HUD effects,
    the edge detection mode works by analyzing and detecting
    sharp changes in the per-pixel surface normal and depth
    values stored to the normal/depth MRT buffer during the
    previous rendering operation (which are still accessible).
    The pixel shader then assigns monochrome output colors to the
    corresponding pixels based on the analysis of these values at
    the current pixel and neighboring pixels within a small
    sampling kernel. If the comparison of pixel values produces
    differences that exceed threshold values, it signifies
    changes in scene geometry that represent an edge, and the
    output pixel is assigned the edge color.</li>

    <li>Infra-Red&mdash;The infra-red effect works nearly
    identically to the night vision effect. The differences are
    that a one-dimensional texture is used to convert the
    luminance values to color values that are inside the masked
    area of the killbot HUD. Pixels outside the masked area are
    modulated by a monochrome luminance vector and then inverted
    to give the darkening effect. No blur is performed but noise
    is added to all pixels.</li>

    <li>Magnify&mdash;The fish-eye magnification technique is
    another of the killbot HUD effects and is done with a process
    identical to the way the heat shimmer is generated. However,
    instead of using the heat shimmer scene object rendering
    (i.e. the fire heat-waves and/or blaster projectile) as the
    initial lookup mask for what is to be distorted, the rendered
    texture version of the killbot's HUD is used in its place to
    identify magnification areas. The pixel shader for this
    effect generates the circular fish-eye perturbation of the
    texture coordinates used for the final step of applying the
    main rendered scene colors to the output buffer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The code and associated shaders of MRTShadersEffect are based
on concepts from the Microsoft DirectX 9 "PostProcess"
sample.</p>

<h2>NiOpaqueOnlyCullingProcess</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiOpaqueOnlyCullingProcess</span>
is a culling process that handles alpha blended objects uniquely.
During a culling pass, it can optionally store alpha blended
objects in a unique set that is then used to render alpha
blending objects separately and later during the drawing process.
This culling process is interesting in that it populates not one
but two independent visible array objects, one for opaque
objects, and one for alpha blended objects, allowing the two
types of objects to be rendered completely independently (in this
case, to different render targets).</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiOpaqueOnlyCullingProcess</span>
is only used in the demo when it is run on hardware that cannot
perform post-pixel-shader blending operations into floating-point
render targets. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiOpaqueOnlyCullingProcess</span> is part of a
workaround for this. The steps involved with this workaround
are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Opaque objects are drawn first to a floating point render
    target.</li>

    <li>Transparent objects are drawn to a traditional 32-bit
    buffer using the existing z-buffer from the previous opaque
    object pass. This 32-bit color buffer was first cleared to
    black and additive blending is done while drawing the
    transparent objects.</li>

    <li>Render a full screen polygon to another floating point
    render target with the opaque object render target as the
    polygon's base map and the transparent object render target
    as glow map.</li>

    <li>Proceed normally in the application with this final
    floating point render target as input to proceeding
    application steps.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> uses
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiOpaqueOnlyCullingProcess</span>
after the application detects the necessity for it at
startup.</p>

<h2>PostProcessEffect</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">PostProcessEffect</span> is a base
class that provides logistical support for all post-process
rendering effects as they are interfaced by the sample through
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">PostProcessManager.</span></p>

<h2>PostProcessManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">PostProcessManager</span> manages
all of the post-processing effects in the demo, that are
optionally performed after the main 3D scene rendering. It
provides interfaces for adding and removing effects as well as
methods for managing the overall post-process effect drawing
operations, which can be called just once per all of the
instances of post-processing effects. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> interacts with the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">PostProcessManager</span> to control
its creation and operation, including drawing.</p>

<h2>ShadowGeometry</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry</span> class
supports automatic, projected shadows. The class includes the
ability to generate the shadow image each frame from a set of
"caster" geometry. Alternatively, a static shadow may be read
from an image file at load time. The class also supports
projection of the shadow onto a set of "recipient" geometry,
culling pieces of geometry that do not need to receive the
shadow. This creates a high-quality, high-performance shadow
effect with minimal application-level code. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"MOUT_Sample_Code_Overview.htm">ShadowGeometry</a></span> is used
mostly intact as described in the MOUT sample. In addition to the
functionality provided in MOUT, the Metal Wars shadow code adds
the ability to modify the shadow casting direction based on the
closest fire light in the Metal Wars scene. The rendered shadow
texture itself is also blurred with a custom shader to give it a
soft-edged effect.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry</span> depends upon
several of the other support classes in the application for
specific features:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> object is
    used to query the world-space direction of the light, which
    is assumed to be casting the shadow. <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry</span> also uses the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>'s information
    logging interfaces to log any errors encountered during the
    shadowing process. Finally, the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> is used to access the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span>
    object.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span>: Is
    used in several places to determine the geometry upon which
    the shadow is cast. The terrain is picked in order to locate
    a center of the projected shadow volume, and the terrain
    objects and triangles are tested against the shadow camera
    clipping planes. Geometry from the terrain manager that is
    found to fall within the shadow camera's frustum is added to
    the list of recipient geometry in each frame.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sparks</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Sparks</span> is a class that
implements a procedural geometry effect. The idea behind the
effect is to make moving particles appear to be motion-blurred by
replacing the point-like billboard particles with screen-aligned
quads that are extruded in the direction that the particle is
moving from frame to frame. Sparks manages a single <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span> object that
contains the visible, motion-blurred "particles" that are based
on the positions and velocities of a collection of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSParticleSystem.htm">NiPSParticleSystem</a></span>
objects in the sample's scene. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Sparks</span> generates per-particle quads that
are updated per-frame to be camera-facing and dynamic in length
based on the actual particle velocity (as described by
artist-directed movement of the particle systems at export time).
In the case of <span class="NDLSystemFont">Sparks</span>, the
actual <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span>
source objects are not drawn at all, as the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Sparks</span> geometry replaces them in the
visual scene. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> are used for Update
information, however.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Sparks</span> class depends on
<span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> to create it and
feed it appropriate <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> objects. At load time,
the scene graph for the main Metal Wars scene file is traversed
looking for a tagged object with a specific name tag. All
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> child
objects beneath this node are converted to work as <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Sparks</span>.</p>

<h2>TerrainManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> loads and
manages a separate NIF file that is assumed to contain only a
single object that represents just the ground geometry that
should be picked against (via <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiCollision/NiPick.htm">NiPick</a></span>)
to determine height placement for objects above the terrain. The
<span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> is created and
initialized by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> is used
by the Killbot (primarily in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Killbot::UpdateCollisionBasedPosition</span>) to
ground the soldier on the terrain. It is also used by the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> to prevent
the camera from going through the ground.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> is
dependent on only the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> solely for debug logging
purposes.</p>

<h2>WorldManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> is the main
"operations hub" for the Metal Wars demo. As mentioned in the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">MetalWars</span> class description,
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> is used to
create the world (as called in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MetalWars::CreateScene</span>) and handle the
application's run-time processing via several <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> interface calls in
<span class="NDLSystemFont">MetalWars::OnIdle</span>. The
<span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> is globally
available via a static <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager::Get</span> function.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> maintains
sub-managers (and accessor functions) for the other MetalWars
application classes that are effectively globally accessible to
the entire application. Therefore <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WorldManager</span> is dependent on most of the
other classes in the MetalWars application.</p>

<h2>ZPassSorter</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">ZPassSorter</span> is used to do
z-only pass drawing in Metal Wars. The z-only pass technique can
be useful in some applications to improve performance. Search
<a href="http://developer.nvidia.com" target=
"_blank">developer.nvidia.com</a> for "z-only pass" for more
details on this technique. By default "z pass" operations are not
enabled in Metal Wars as it does not make a significant positive
impact on performance due to the object complexity of the
scene.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">ZPassSorter</span> is a
straightforward accumulator that is only active when the demo has
z-only pass rendering enabled. It handles the job of disabling
color writes in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">StartAccumulating</span>, then doing a shader
swap on objects as it encounters them in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RegisterObjectArray</span>, replacing any
existing shader with a very basic, minimal expense, shader. After
it draws an object, it restores the object's original shader. In
<span class="NDLSystemFont">FinishAccumulating</span>, it
re-enables color writes in the renderer.</p>
