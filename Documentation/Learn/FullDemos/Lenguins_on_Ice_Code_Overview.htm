<h1>Lenguins on Ice Code Overview</h1>

<p>The Lenguins on Ice source code is divided into several files
constituting the application's C++ classes. Each class is
contained within source files (.h, .inl, and .cpp) of the same
name. The following descriptions give developers a brief idea of
the way that the collections of classes in Lenguins on Ice work
together to provide overall functionality. For this reason, the
dependency listings for each class should be of high
interest.</p>

<h2>Lenguins</h2>

<p>Lenguins is the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiApplication/Introduction_to_NiApplication.htm">
NiApplication</a>-</span>derived class for the Lenguins on Ice
application. The specific interfaces it relies on from
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span> are for
initialization (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Lenguins::Initialize</span>), shutdown
(<span class="NDLSystemFont">Lenguins::Terminate</span>),
renderer and scene creation (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Lenguins::CreateRenderer</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Lenguins::CreateScene</span>), and rendering
(<span class="NDLSystemFont">Lenguins::OnIdle</span>).</p>

<p>Somewhat unique to the Lenguins on Ice sample (relative to
other Gamebryo sample applications) is the fact that little of
the real work done in the application is maintained in the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Lenguins</span> class itself. As
such, and in addition to its dependency on <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiApplication/Introduction_to_NiApplication.htm">
NiApplication</a></span>, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Lenguins</span> class is dependent on the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Scheduler</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LevelManager</span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ScreenOverlay</span> classes.</p>

<h2>Scheduler</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Scheduler</span> is responsible
for executing all the tasks in the application. In this demo all
units of work are broken up into individual tasks. Each task is
defined as one of three different types: <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">TYPE_TIME</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">TYPE_FRAME</span>, or <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">TYPE_RENDER</span>. A <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">TYPE_TIME</span> task is only executed on time
intervals specified by the task. A <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">TYPE_FRAME</span> task is executed every frame
before rendering occurs. A <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">TYPE_RENDER</span> task is executed every frame
during the scene rendering process. These tasks are responsible
for many different operations within the demo some of which
include: flocking, player controls, scene updates, and rendering.
When the sample is initialized these tasks are inserted into the
scheduler, which is then responsible for executing the task at
the appropriate time, including scheduling additional tasks.</p>

<h2>LevelManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">LevelManager</span> provides a
central location to manage the level data, control logic, and
rendering process for the demo. The update provided by the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">LevelManager</span> is tasked with
pausing execution of PhysX, fetching the PhysX results, updating
the locations and orientations of source and destination based
PhysX objects. <span class="NDLSystemFont">LevelManager's</span>
Update method is the primary source from which most game logic is
executed and updated. It is responsible for rendering the entire
scene and properly organizing different render dependent
effects.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">LevelManager</span> is dependent
on seven other application classes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">CameraController</span> is used
    during the rendering process to render the scene with the
    current view; it is updated by the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">InputManager</span>.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">EffectManager</span>: This
    class is used to manage particle effects in the sample that
    are triggered by in game collisions. Namely it is used to
    handle the particle effects for puffs of snow and baby fur.
    It is used by the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">LevelManager</span> both for updating and
    rendering the scene.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">FlockManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">FlockManager</span> controls the
    AI for the baby lenguins. It handles all the flocking logic
    causing the babies to gather near their momma and to chase
    after ice blocks. It is used by the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">LevelManager</span> both for updating and
    rendering the scene.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">IceBlockManager</span>: This
    handles all the ice blocks in the application. It is used to
    create new ice blocks, break ice blocks, and remove them from
    the scene. It is used by the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">LevelManager</span> both for updating and
    rendering the scene.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">MommaManager</span>: This is
    used to facilitate interactions between the player input
    provided by the input manager and the momma lenguin in the
    demo. It is used by the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">LevelManager</span> both for updating and
    rendering the scene.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> is used to
    manage and render the terrain in the scene, to determine if a
    portion of terrain is traversable or not, and used when
    shadow geometry is created. It is used by the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">LevelManager</span> for both for updating and
    rendering the scene.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ScreenOverlay</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">ScreenOverlay</span> is used to
display all 2D elements on the screen that are not a part of the
actual playable world. This consists of all the heads up display
elements during game play as well as the menu items. When a menu
is displayed input from the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">InputManager</span> passed to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ScreenOverlay</span> where it quits, restarts, or
resumes the current game.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">ScreenOverlay</span> is dependent
on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">InputManager</span>: When a
    menu is open all relevant the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">InputManager</span> polls is passed to
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">ScreenOverlay</span> so it can
    respond the input appropriately.</li>
</ul>

<h2>LenguinManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">LenguinManager</span> is
responsible for controlling, updating, and drawing each lenguin
in the demo. Each lenguin is controlled with a single
<span class="NDLSystemFont">LenguinManager</span>. Two of its
more significant methods are <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AvoidCollisions</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateBipedTransforms</span>. Each tree in the
scene is assigned a collider which described a non-walkable area
around the tree. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AvoidCollisions</span> is used when determining
which direction a lenguin is going to move to ensure that they do
not walk through any trees. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateBipedTransforms</span> is used to calculate
a lenguins new location and orientation based on which direction
the lenguins wants to move and where it is located on the
terrain. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> is
polled to ensure the lenguin only walks on allowed areas and to
determine the height of the lenguin.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">LenguinManager</span> is dependent
on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> is used to
    manage and render the terrain in the scene, to determine if a
    portion of terrain is traversable or not, and used when
    shadow geometry is created. <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">LenguinManager</span> polls the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> when determining if a
    lenguin is trying to move to a non-walkable area.</li>
</ul>

<h2>BabyManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">BabyManager</span> is derived from
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">LenguinManager</span> class and
primarily serves as a control layer between the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FlockManager</span> logic and the lenguin's
animation controller. The desired direction of movement for the
baby is input from the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FlockManager</span> and based on the baby's
current location, orientation, and animation the baby's new
orientation will be updated accordingly. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">BabyManager</span> is also responsible for
turning control of the baby over to PhysX when the baby has been
hit by an ice block and for returning control back after the baby
is not longer stunned from the ice block. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">BabyManager</span> handles other miscellaneous
tasks such as updating the baby's current level of detail,
causing the baby to chase after ice blocks, and rendering the
baby's ghost if they die.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">BabyManager</span> is dependent
on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">LenguinManager</span>: This
    is used by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">BabyManager</span>
    to handle updating the orientation and location of the baby's
    animation controller along with rendering.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">IceBlockManager</span>: When
    the desired direction for a baby is being computed if it does
    not already have an ice block target the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">FlockManager</span> will have the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">BabyManager</span> search for a
    possible ice block it would like to go after. If an ice block
    is found and the baby is far enough away from its mother, the
    baby will deviate from the flock towards the ice block.</li>
</ul>

<h2>MommaManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">MommaManager</span> is derived
from the <span class="NDLSystemFont">LenguinManager</span> class
and primarily serves as a control layer between the player input
and the animation controller of the momma. The input provided by
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">InputManager</span> is passed to
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">MommaManager</span> and
interpreted to determine how the momma should move and interact
with the world.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">MommaManager</span> is dependent
on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">LenguinManager</span>: This
    is used by the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">MommaManager</span> to handle updating the
    orientation and location of the lenguins' animation
    controller along with rendering the lenguin.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">InputManager</span>: This is
    used to provide the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">MommaManager</span> with the users current
    desired actions for the momma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FlockManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">FlockManager</span> is used as the
primary AI for controlling the baby lenguins. Standard flocking
techniques using cohesion, separation, and alignment are employed
to cause the babies to move as a group. Unlike normal flocking,
extra logic is implemented to give the babies an odd fascination
with ice blocks. This causes babies that have trailed away from
their mother to chase after ice blocks.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">FlockManager</span> is dependent
on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">BabyManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">BabyManager</span> class is used
    as both a form of input and output for the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">FlockManager</span>. The current location and
    orientation of each baby is used when computing the baby
    neighborhood. After all the babies in the flock have been
    analyzed their new orientation and movement is then provided
    to them. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">BabyManager</span>
    is also used to determine if a baby wants to chase an ice
    block. In this case the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">FlockManager</span> releases control of the
    baby until the baby is done chasing the ice block.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">IceBlockManager</span>: When
    the desired direction for a baby is being computed if it does
    not already have an ice block target the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">FlockManager</span> will have the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">BabyManager</span> search for a
    possible ice blocks it might want to go after. If a desirable
    ice block is found the baby will deviate from the flock
    towards the ice block.</li>
</ul>

<h2>EffectAccumulator</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">EffectAccumulator</span> is a
specialized accumulator derived from the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AlphaAccumulator</span> class. It is used to sort
objects with alpha properties just as <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AlphaAccumulator</span>, except for when an
object has a shader attached that requires processing of the data
in the back buffer. These objects are rendered in back to front
order and before an object with such a shader is rendered the
contents of the back buffer is copied to a texture so that its
color data can be used by the shader. There are two shaders in
the demo that trigger this specialized case, the IceCube shader
and the HeatShimmer shader. Being able to ensure that these
objects are rendered in back to front order allows the IceCube
shader to refract light from everything behind it including other
ice cubes, and the HeatShimmer shader to bend the light from
everything behind.</p>

<h2>IceBlockManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">IceBlockManager</span> handles the
spawning, breaking, and removal of ice blocks. Each ice block in
the level is an instance of a single ice block model and also has
an ice block pieces model associated with it. A scheduled task
will call the <span class="NDLSystemFont">IceBlockManager</span>
informing it to spawn new ice blocks. New ice blocks will then be
spawned at a geyser location with a given velocity. As the ice
blocks interact with the world, they maybe either broken by the
momma lenguin, hit and injure baby lenguins, or eventually slide
off the cliff. When they are broken the current ice block is
replaced with an instance of its associated ice block pieces
model. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">IceBlockManager</span> is
also responsible for rendering the shadows of each ice block.</p>

<h2>InputManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">InputManager</span> polls input
from the keyboard, mouse, and a game pad (if one is available).
The input data is either polled for game play use or for
interacting with a game menu.</p>

<h2>ShadowGeometry</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry</span> class
supports automatic, projected shadows. The class includes the
ability to generate a shadow image each frame from a set of
"caster" geometry. The class supports projection of the shadow
onto a set of "recipient" geometry, culling pieces of geometry
that do not need to receive the shadow. This creates a
high-quality, high-performance shadow effect with minimal
application-level code. The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"MOUT_Sample_Code_Overview.htm">ShadowGeometry</a></span> is used
mostly intact as described in the MOUT sample.</p>

<p>The sample can afford a higher texture resolution for each
shadow for the Momma Lenguin and the ice blocks, since there are
relatively fewer of them in a given frame. However, due to the
large number of baby Lenguin shadows that must be rendered, a
lower texture resolution than might be desired is used for the
babies for performance reasons. As a result, visible aliasing may
be noticeable around the edges of each of those shadows. To
address this problem, a blur shader is applied to each shadow.
Blurring the projected shadow creates a soft shadow edge with no
aliasing.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry</span> is dependent
on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span>: The
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> is used in
    several places to determine the geometry upon which the
    shadow is cast. The terrain is picked in order to locate a
    center of the projected shadow volume, and the diced terrain
    triangles are tested against the shadow camera clipping
    planes. Geometry from the terrain manager that is found to
    fall within the shadow camera's frustum is added to the list
    of recipient geometry in each frame.</li>
</ul>

<h2>TerrainManager</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainManager</span> loads and
manages two separate NIF files. The first file is assumed to
contain a single object that represents only the ground plane
against which picking should be done (via <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/NiPick.htm">NiPick</a>) to determine
height placement for objects above the terrain. The second file
is assumed to contain a diced version of the terrain from which
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShadowGeometry</span> class can
be easily polled to determine how to generate and clip the shadow
geometry.</p>
