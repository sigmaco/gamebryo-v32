<h1>Trigger Library</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The TriggersLibrary is an Entity Modeling Tool (EMT) project which defines
models to handle Triggers. Triggers are entities which may check for a
condition to occur and contain behaviors for how to respond to that
condition.</p>

<p>Triggers have two basic components: Sources and Responses. Fully-implemented
Triggers are created by mixing in zero or one Trigger Sources and at least one
Trigger Response. Since the source and response models are independent, unique
triggers can be created by mixing and matching sources and responses without
having to implement any additional behaviors.</p>

<h2>Trigger Sources</h2>

<p>A Trigger Source is just a model that calls an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">OnTrigger</span> behavior on itself under some condition. What
that condition is varies from trigger source to trigger source. The
TriggersLibrary defines a set of sources, but you are free to define your own.
Make sure to mix AbstractTriggerSource into your trigger source.</p>

<p>Note that the Trigger Source does not <em>define</em> the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">OnTrigger</span> behavior; it merely <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">refers</span> to it. It is the responsibility of the Trigger
Response object to define the behavior that will be called.</p>

<p>The following trigger sources are defined in TriggersLibrary:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Model Name</th>

            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__AbstractTriggerSource.htm">AbstractTriggerSource</a></td>

            <td>Base mix-in for all trigger sources.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__CollisionTriggerSource.htm">CollisionTriggerSource</a></td>

            <td>Fires when something collides with it.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__EntitiesDeadSource.htm">EntitiesDeadSource</a></td>

            <td>Fires when no instances of a given model type exist.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__OnCreateTriggerSource.htm">OnCreateTriggerSource</a></td>

            <td>Fires immediately when created.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__PeriodicTriggerSource.htm">PeriodicTriggerSource</a></td>

            <td>Fires repeatedly at a given interval after invoked.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href="TriggersLibrary__TouchSource.htm">TouchSource</a></td>

            <td>Fires when touched by another entity in game.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Trigger Responses</h2>

<p>A Trigger Response is a model that implements the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">OnTrigger</span> behavior to do something. What it does varies
from trigger response to trigger response. The TriggersLibrary defines a set of
responses, but you are free to define your own. Make sure to mix
AbstractTriggerResponse into your trigger response. The following trigger
responses are defined in TriggersLibrary:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Model Name</th>

            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__AbstractTriggerResponse.htm">AbstractTriggerResponse</a></td>

            <td>Base mix-in for all trigger responses.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__AnimationResponse.htm">AnimationResponse</a></td>

            <td>Plays an animation on self when invoked.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__DelayedSpawnResponse.htm">DelayedSpawnResponse</a></td>

            <td>Spawns an entity after some given sleep time.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__MultiTargetResponse.htm">MultiTargetResponse</a></td>

            <td>Calls the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTrigger</span> behavior
            of multiple entities when invoked. By using MultiTargetResponse,
            you can cause a single trigger source to invoke multiple trigger
            responses.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__RemoteBehaviorResponse.htm">RemoteBehaviorResponse</a></td>

            <td>Call an arbitrary behavior on another entity when invoked.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__RemoteBoolPropertyResponse.htm">RemoteBoolPropertyResponse</a></td>

            <td>Set a boolean on another entity when invoked.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__SpawnResponse.htm">SpawnResponse</a></td>

            <td>Create an entity when invoked.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Complete Triggers</h2>

<p>A Complete Trigger is a model which mixes in zero or one Trigger Sources and
at least one Trigger Response. It represents a complete in-game entity which
can take action when certain conditions are met. The TriggersLibrary defines
some triggers for you, but it is easy to mix in Trigger Sources and Trigger
Responses to create your own meaningful trigger types which handle different
conditions. The following Triggers are defined by the TriggersLibrary:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Model Name</th>

            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__CollisionSpawnPoint.htm">CollisionSpawnPoint</a></td>

            <td>Spawn an entity when something collides with an object.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__CollisionTrigger.htm">CollisionTrigger</a></td>

            <td>Invoke multiple Trigger Response objects when something
            collides with an object.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__DoorOpenOnTouch.htm">DoorOpenOnTouch</a></td>

            <td>Open a door when it is touched.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__OnCreateInvoker.htm">OnCreateInvoker</a></td>

            <td>Call a behavior on an entity when created.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__PeriodicMultiInvoker.htm">PeriodicMultiInvoker</a></td>

            <td>Invoke multiple Trigger Response objects repeatedly with a fixed
            delay.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href=
            "TriggersLibrary__TouchAnimTrigger.htm">TouchAnimTrigger</a></td>

            <td>Play an animation when an object is touched.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>It is possible to have a complete trigger that only contains Trigger
Responses. In this case, it is expected that the response would be remotely
activated by another entity. A common example is when one trigger mixes in
<span class="NDLSystemFont">MultiTargetResponse</span> and points its target
list properties at other entities that only contain responses.</p>
