<h1>MangledMetal AI</h1>

<p>MangledMetal combat AI (Artificial Intelligence) consists of a series of Lua
behaviors on the AISimple model. The Waypoint model is used to control AI
patrolling behavior.</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Model Name</th>

            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="MangledMetal__AISimple.htm">AISimple</a></td>

            <td>Implements a simple combat AI (Artificial Intelligence) using
            Lua behaviors.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><a href="MangledMetal__Waypoint.htm">Waypoint</a></td>

            <td>A waypoint in an AI patrolling network. Waypoints are linked
            together to form waypoint networks. An AI can navigate to a
            waypoint, then ask that waypoint where to go next.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Each behavior represents a state in the AI. The start behavior is invoked by
the OnCreate behavior of the entity, which runs automatically upon entity
creation. Once started, an AI behavior is always running on the entity until it
dies. Each time the entity transitions out of a state into another state, the
old behavior invokes the target behavior and then exits.</p>

<p>The behaviors all sleep periodically, then wake up and evaluate conditions.
Time-intensive processing such as following a given entity or pathfinding take
place in C++ built-ins.</p>

<p>Each AI state behavior name begins with "AIState". The states all perform
setup and initialization, then enter a loop that repeats until explicitly
exited. The algorithm for each state's loop is basically the same:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Check for exit conditions; if one is found, invoke the behavior for the
    target state and exit.</li>

    <li>Perform state-specific tasks</li>

    <li>Sleep for 'SleepTime' milliseconds.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that pathfinding is not covered by these Lua scripts. The scripts just
set a target location to walk to or a target enemy to walk towards. C++ code in
the MmCharacter and MmWalkable services figures out how to get the character
there.</p>

<p>The following states are supported in the Combat AI:</p>

<h2>AIStatePatrolling</h2>

<p>The AIStatePatrolling behavior is the start state for the AI. It is invoked
directly from the OnCreate behavior, called by the system when the entity is
created. Its exit conditions are</p>

<ul>
    <li>If the entity itself is dead, exit.</li>

    <li>If any enemy is closer than 'PerceptionRadius', transition to
    AIStateMoveToCombat.</li>
</ul>

<p>The AI determines if a given entity is an enemy by testing the target
entity's "MyFactions" property against its own "HateFactions". The factions are
lists of bytes; if my "HateFactions" property contains the letter "A", and a
target's "MyFactions" property contains the letter "A", then that entity is my
enemy.</p>

<p>If the exit conditions are not taken, the entity checks to see if it has
reached the position of the waypoint specified by its 'CurrentWaypoint' value.
If it has reached that position, it will ask the current waypoint where to go
next. The waypoint will modify the entity's 'CurrentWaypoint' value to a new
location so that the next pass through the AI will move to the new location. If
the entity has not reached the 'CurrentWaypoint' value, it does nothing; the
C++ code, which runs much more frequently, will take care of moving the entity
to the waypoint.</p>

<h2>AIStateMoveToCombat</h2>

<p>Once an enemy is detected, the entity will move towards that enemy. The
behavior sets the enemy into its 'MoveToEntity' property, which is picked up by
the MmCharacter C++ class and used to route the AI-driven character to the
enemy. The C++ class is used rather than having the AI do the work because the
C++ code runs more frequently, so it can adjust to movements by the enemy more
smoothly.</p>

<p>Each time through the loop, the AIStateMoveToCombat class will check these
exit conditions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If the entity itself is dead, exit.</li>

    <li>If the 'MoveToEntity' entity is dead, transition back to
    AIStatePatrolling.</li>

    <li>If the 'MoveToEntity' entity is farther away than 'PerceptionRadius',
    transition back to AIStatePatrolling.</li>

    <li>If the 'MoveToEntity' entity is closer than 'RangedAttackRadius',
    transition to AIStateRangedAttack.</li>
</ul>

<p>As with the AIStatePatrolling, detailed movement is handled by the C++ code.
The AI code simply tells the C++ code which other entity to path towards. The
C++ code can implement whatever pathing algorithm it likes to move the entity
to its target. In the current implementation, movement is quite simplistic; no
A* or pathing algorithm is used, just a linear move towards the enemy. However,
if such an algorithm were to be implemented, it would only affect the C++ code;
the Lua behaviors and properties would stay the same.</p>

<h2>AIStateRangedAttack</h2>

<p>In the current implementation of MangledMetal, there are no ranged attacks,
but the AI makes provisions for one anyway. Since there are no ranged attacks,
this state effectively works just like AIStateMoveToCombat - the character
continues to move towards the enemy until it gets to melee combat range. The
exit conditions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If the entity itself is dead, exit.</li>

    <li>If the 'MoveToEntity' entity is dead, transition back to
    AIStatePatrolling.</li>

    <li>If the 'MoveToEntity' entity is farther away than 'RangedAttackRadius',
    transition to AIStateMoveToCombat.</li>

    <li>If the 'MoveToEntity' entity is closer than 'MeleeAttackRadius',
    transition to state AIMeleeAttack.</li>
</ul>

<p>If none of the exit conditions are taken, then this behavior should
implement the ranged attack. Currently ranged attacks are not implemented in
MangledMetal, so this behavior does nothing at this point.</p>

<h2>AIStateMeleeAttack</h2>

<p>When this state is reached, the AI character is close enough to engage in
melee combat. Exit conditions are still checked as usual:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If the entity itself is dead, exit.</li>

    <li>If the 'MoveToEntity' entity is dead, transition back to
    AIStatePatrolling.</li>

    <li>If the 'MoveToEntity' entity is farther away than 'MeleeAttackRadius',
    transition to AIStateRangedAttack.</li>
</ul>

<p>If none of the exit conditions are taken, the AI character launches a melee
attack on the enemy.</p>
