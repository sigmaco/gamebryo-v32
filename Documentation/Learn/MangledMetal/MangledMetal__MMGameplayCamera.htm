<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The gameplay camera has a single subject entity at any given time.  The camera translates toward and away from the subject along a rail that is calculated at runtime.  The shape of the rail is determined by a hinge on the horizon (tunable) such that, normally, the top edge of the camera’s field of view is aligned with hinge regardless of the distance from the camera to the subject.  The rail has a near-subject camera stop point that sets the minimum distance from the camera to the subject.  The camera stop point exists on a ring that is a given height (tunable) above the subject’s ground point and a given distance (tunable) from the subject’s vertical center line.  The rail has a far-subject camera stop point that is determined by the maximum camera-hinge-subject angle (tunable).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Regardless of translation the camera always rotates towards a focus point that is a given height (tunable) above the subject’s ground point.  Having a focus point separate from the near-subject camera stop point allows some variety in the close-in perspective: </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>1 - When the focus point and near-subject camera stop point are the same, the camera appears to simply zoom into the subject along the rail with the horizon locked at the hinge.  That is, the hinge will appear to be fixed on the screen and no terrain beyond the hinge will be visible. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>2 - When the focus point is above the near-subject camera stop point, the horizon appears to flare up gradually as the camera gets closer to the subject and the camera will be pointed upwards when it hits the camera stop point. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>3 - When the focus point is below the near-subject camera stop point, the horizon appears to close in as the camera gets closer to the subject and the camera will be pointed downwards when it hits the camera stop point.</p>
<p></p>

For proxies this scale always overrides the &quot;Scale&quot; property for rendering in the editor because that property may have another meaning that is not visual (for the proxy).  This property can also be used to correct art authored at a different scale from the rest of the world.  The Proxy Scale will be multiplied by the World Scale setting in a block to arrive at the actual rendered scale of the proxy.  The Proxy Scale value should represent the scale to apply to an object inserted into a meter scale world to make it look correct relative to other meter scale objects.  So if your proxy art were authored in centimeters, this value would be 0.01.</td>
