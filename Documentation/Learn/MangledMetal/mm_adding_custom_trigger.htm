<h1>Adding a custom trigger type to MangledMetal</h1>

<p>Thanks to the use of the flexible Entity Modeling system, MangledMetal is
easy to extend with new functionality.</p>

<p>Let's say you want to add a new complete trigger that implements "land
mine" functionality. We want to define a region that causes an explosion the
first time any actor (player or enemy) moves into it.</p>

<p>To get started, first invoke Toolbench and open the file <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MangledMetal.gsl</span> from the directory <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Samples\GameDemos\MangledMetal\Data</span>.
Make sure the file <span class="NDLSystemFont">MangledMetal.emtproj</span> is
writeable since we will be editing it. Also make sure that the contents of the
directories <span class="NDLSystemFont">MangledMetal\Models</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">MangledMetal\Flats</span> are all writeable. These
directories contain the model and flat files that we will be modifying.</p>

<p>Once the GSL file is loaded, double-click on <span class="NDLSystemFont">
MangledMetal.emtproj</span> in the Game Solution pane.</p>

<p>The EMT Project Explorer opens in the same pane as the Game Solution 
pane. The EMT Project Explorer shows you the models, presets, and folders in 
an EMT Project. You'll use this view to create and manage your game's 
entity models.</p>

<p>Now let's create the land mine model:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Make sure the MangledMetal EMT Project is open in the breadcrumb 
		control at the top of the EMT Project Explorer. Press "Add-&gt;New Model".

        <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img src="images/CreateModel.PNG" alt=
            "Create Model">
        </div>
    </li>

    <li>If the Entity Model Editor is not visible on the right side of the
    screen, enable it using the View menu. Change the name of the new model to
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">LandMine</span>.</li>

    <li>The land mine will be triggered when an actor (player or enemy) comes
    within a certain distance. The <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">CollisionTriggerSource</span> model, defined in the
    TriggersLibrary, detects an actor entering a given region, so we will want
    to mix that in to the land mine model. Select the TriggersLibrary  
		in the breadcrumb control. The models and presets in the TriggersLibrary
		are displayed in the Contents list. Click on the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">CollisionTriggerSource</span> model and drag it into the
    top half of the LandMine Entity Model window. While you are dragging, you
    should see a tooltip "Drop in this region to add a mix-in to LandMine". Go
    ahead and drop the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">CollisionTriggerSource</span> into the mix-in area.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionTriggerSource</span> has some
    properties that need to be set. It has the ability to limit the models that
    can trigger it - so, for example, it will fire only if the player
    approaches. We need to turn that ability off since any actor can trigger
    the land mine. Go to the Entity Model Editor on the right side and make
    sure you are still editing <span class="NDLSystemFont">LandMine</span>.
    Click the downward-facing arrow next to Mixin Properties. Set the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">UseModelFilter</span> property to a value of
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">False</span>.

        <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img src="images/SetProperty.png" alt="Set Property">
        </div>
    </li>

    <li>Next, let's set the size of the land mine's detection area - the area
    that, when entered, will cause an explosion. Edit the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ShapeType</span> property, which is inherited from the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">PhysXShape</span> model, to change the shape
    type to sphere. Edit the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ShapeDimensions</span>
    property, also inherited from <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">PhysXShape</span>, and change its value from the default of
    "1,1,1" to "500,500,500" (only the first value matters and is used for the
    sphere radius).<br>
    <br>
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">PhysXShape</span> properties were brought into 
		the <span class="NDLSystemFont">LandMine</span> model because we 
		mixed-in <span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionTriggerSource</span>, which 
		has <span class="NDLSystemFont">PhysXShape</span> mixed-in to it. Note that 
		we are setting the <strong>default</strong>	detection area for a land mine 
		by setting this property, not the specific size for a specific mine. It is 
		possible to override the size for each mine.<br></li>

    <li>When the user enters the region, we need to spawn an explosion entity,
    so let's mix in a <span class="NDLSystemFont">SpawnResponse</span> model.
    Go back to the TriggersLibrary and drag the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">SpawnResponse</span> mix-in to the top half of the LandMine
    Entity Model editor window. Make sure the Entity Model Editor is still
    editing <span class="NDLSystemFont">LandMine</span>, then set the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">ModelToSpawn</span> mix-in property to
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">SpawnEffect</span>. (<span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">SpawnEffect</span> is a model in the MangledMetal EMT
    project that looks like a green explosion.)</li>

    <li>Now we need to set up a Property Visualizer so we can view in World 
		Builder the collision volume that our object will use. Make sure
    that you are still editing <span class="NDLSystemFont">LandMine</span> in
    the Entity Model Editor window. Expand the Property Visualizers section and
    click <span class="NDLSystemFont">Add</span> to add a new visualizer. Set
    the visualizer type to <span class="NDLSystemFont">Sphere</span>. Click the
    downward-pointing arrow to the left of the visualizer name to expand the
    subproperties list, and select the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Radius</span> drop-down. The drop-down shows a list of all
    the properties of the object; you'll want to select <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ShapeDimensions</span> as the value for this
    visualizer.</li>

    <li>In addition to visualizing the detection area in the edit-time tools,
    we want to be able to see the land mine at runtime. Let's add a runtime
    representation of the land mine. Add a mix-in of type <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Mesh</span> from the StandardModelLibrary project. Select 
		<span class="NDLSystemFont">StandardModelLibrary</span>  
		from the breadcrumb bar in the EMT Project Explorer and find the model named 
		<span class="NDLSystemFont">Mesh</span>. We're going to
    reuse the "Soul Cage" asset from MangledMetal. Make sure you are still
    editing LandMine, then set the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NifAsset</span>
    property of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Mesh</span> mix-in. Click the
    "..." button to bring up an asset selector, and select <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Data\MangledMetal\GamebryoData\Generic\Props\Soulcage.nif</span>
    as the asset. In order to distinguish between the land mine and other
    instances of soul cages, we'll change the scale of the land mine; edit the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">Scale</span> property of <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Placeable</span> and set it to 0.25.</li>

    <li>Save the active <span class="NDLSystemFont">MangledMetal.emtproj</span> 
		content by pressing the toolbar button with a diskette image on it. The 
		asterisk next to the file name in the content tab goes away indicating that 
		the content no longer needs saving.</li>

    <li>Now let's add a land mine to the world. Switch to the Game Solution 
		view and open the file <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">EmptyBattlefield.block</span>. At the bottom of the pane, 
		you'll see tabs for "Game Solution", "Palette View", and "Entity View". 
		Switch to Palette View so we can add our land mine. The Palette View lets 
		you see the models and presets of all EMT Projects in your solution, creating 
		a structured menu of models and presets that can be instanced in the 
		block file. Open up the ManagledMetal EMT Project contents by 
		double-clicking on the entry in the Contents list. Change the Contents list 
		view type to Thumbnails by clicking on the Views button at the top right of
		the palette view.

        <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img src="images/PaletteView.png" alt=
            "Palette View">
        </div>
    </li>

    <li>In Palette View, scroll down until you find the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">LandMine</span> model. Drag it into the world view on the
    right anywhere. You'll see the mine object (a small soul cage) and a sphere
    visualizer indicating the sensitivity area of this mine. To see the Visualizer
    you must toggle the Property Visualizer option <img src="images/propvis.png" alt="Toggle Property Visualizer">.

        <ol>
            <li>For cube, cylinder, and capsule visualizers, PhysX uses a
            different convention for origins than Gamebryo, and the PhysX
            volumes may not line up correctly with the visualizers you see in
            Toolbench: they typically will be translated upwards by half of
            their height. You can verify this using nVidia's Visual Remote
            Debugger or debug geometry with your runtime application.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Let's run MangledMetal and take a look. We will need to specify a
    command-line parameter to the game to have it load the EmptyBattlefield 
    block file (or level) instead of the default level. In Toolbench, go to 
		Utilities-&gt;Settings.	In the Settings dialog, select User Tab-&gt;World 
		Builder. Set up the path to the MangledMetal application, current 
		directory, and command line as shown.

        <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img src="images/settings.PNG" alt=
            "Settings dialog">
        </div>

        <p class="indent1">Once this is set up, go back to World Builder
        and press ALT+T to launch MangledMetal.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Note that in the running game, the land mine is present and will react
    with an explosion the first time you or an enemy walk over its area.
    However, there are still some shortcomings in its behavior - it doesn't
    disappear after it explodes, and it doesn't do any damage to anyone. To fix
    these problems we'll write some simple Lua script code. Go back to the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">MangledMetal.emtproj</span> project file by 
		clicking on the tab at the top of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">
		EmptyBattlefield.block</span> window in World Builder and make sure you are
    editing the <span class="NDLSystemFont">LandMine</span> model again.</li>

    <li>We need to override the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTrigger</span>
    behavior of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">AbstractTriggerResponse</span>
    mix-in. Click the downward-facing arrow next to <span class="NDLSystemFont">
		Mix-in Behaviors</span>. Find the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTrigger
		</span> behavior and click the downward-facing 
    arrow next to it. Examine the Traits and make sure it says 
		<span class="NDLSystemFont">Extends</span>. This
    means that the parent mix-in behaviors will be called before this model's
    implementation of the behavior (which is what we want). Go ahead and check 
    the checkbox next to the word OnTrigger to indicate you want to override 
		this behavior and then click the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Edit</span> 
		button on the right.</li>

    <li>You are now in the Lua script editor, editing the 
		<span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTrigger</span> behavior of
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">LandMine</span> model. This behavior is called 
		by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnCollisionTrigger</span> model when it 
    detects a player or enemy within its detection zone. The first thing we
    need to do is determine who is going to take damage from this explosion.
    We're going to use a built-in function to get a list of all entities within
    a given radius of our land mine, then iterate over the list doing damage to
    each. After everything else is complete, we'll delete ourselves. Paste the
    following code into the Lua editor (replacing everything you see in the
    editor). After doing that, you'll be able to run MangledMetal again and see
    your land mine in action.
        <pre>
module("EseLandMine", package.seeall)

-- Behavior
function OnTrigger(self, params)
   -- Figure out how big our sensitivity radius is.  It'll be the first element
   -- of our ShapeDimensions property.
   local shapeDimensions = self.ShapeDimensions
   local triggerRadius = shapeDimensions[1]

   -- Call the built-in function to get all entities within a given radius of us.
   local outVal = {}
   outVal = MmWorldServiceBuiltins.GetEntitiesByProximity(self, triggerRadius)

   -- Iterate over the list and damage each entity.
   for i,victimID in pairs(outVal) do
   
      victim = Emergent:GetEntity(victimID)

      -- A model that mixes in "Victim" can take damage.  Anything not a Victim can be ignored.
      if victim:ContainsBuiltin("Victim") == true then
         -- Each Victim will display a damage effect (some sparks), so get the position
         local victimPos = victim.Position

         -- Create a data stream to pass to the Victim's OnAttacked behavior
         local victimStream = ParameterList.ParameterList()
		 
		 victimPos.z = victimPos.z + 100 -- Add some height so it is not right at his feet

         -- The Victim is expecting attacker ID; damage amount; damage effect name; and xyz of effect
         victimStream:PutEntityID(self)
         victimStream:PutFloat32(150) -- 150 points of damage
         victimStream:PutString("DamageEffect") -- Name of effect we want to play when victim takes damage
         victimStream:PutPoint3(victimPos)
		 
         -- Call the Victim to let it know it has been attacked
		 victim:SendEvent("OnAttacked", victimStream, "")
      end
   end
    -- Destroy ourself
    BehaviorAPI.DestroyEntity(self)
end
