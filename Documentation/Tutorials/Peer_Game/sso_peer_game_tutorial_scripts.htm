<h1>Peer Game: Fixing Lua Scripts</h1>

<p>As a last step, here are a few script changes you need to make to get the application working
properly. These changes can be made from Toolbench while the PeerGame instances continue to run.
The results of the saved changes are visible immediately in the game play.</p>

</ol>

<h2>Lua Behavior Changes</h2>

<ol>
    <li>In the <span class="NDLSystemFont">PeerGameTutorial\Samples\GameFramework\BaseGame</span>
    directory, create a script file called <span class="NDLSystemFont">ChannelHelp.lua</span>, with
    the following contents:
        <pre>
module("ChannelHelp", package.seeall)

-- The replication service's private channel
function GetMainChannel()
    baseID = BehaviorAPI.GetEnumValue("eonSystemServiceIDs", "BasicReplication")
    category = BehaviorAPI.GetServicePublicCategory(baseID)
    return category
end
</pre>

        <p class="indent1">This is a utility function, which will be accessed by a couple of the
        behaviors that you are about to add. Note that the standard Lua runtime that ships with
        LightSpeed does normal Lua module importation, which means that other scripts in the same
        directory can reference it simply by doing "require 'ChannelHelp'". It is not necessary to
        do anything in Toolbench to make the script visible to entity behavior scripts.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Fix the avatar animation problem by updating the BgAvatar.SetMovement behavior as follows.
        <pre>
-- use ChannelHelp
require "ChannelHelp"
</pre>
        <pre>
function SetMovement(self, params)
    local movement = params:GetUInt32("MovementType")
    egmSample.SetTargetMovementType(self, movement)

    -- update the animation on the replica entities
    local outstrm = ParameterList.ParameterList()
    if (movement == egmSample.Idle) then
        outstrm:PutString("Idle")
    else
        outstrm:PutString("Run")
    end
    bapiOnline.SendViewEvent(ChannelHelp.GetMainChannel(), self, "SetAnimationSequence", 
        outstrm, 0.0)
end
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Fix other animation issues by adding a new behavior to the TriggeredAnimation model (via the
    Enitity Modeling Tool) called RemoteTriggerAnimation. It should have the following logic:
        <pre>
-- Behavior
function RemoteTriggerAnimation(self, params)
    local anim = params:GetString()
    BehaviorAPI.LogMessage(2, string.format("TriggeredAnimation: Setting animation to %s",
        anim))
    egmAnimation.SetTargetAnimationByName(self, anim)
end
</pre>

        <p class="indent1">Note that the script for this new behavior is identical to what we have
        for the 'TriggerAnimation' behavior. This new behavior is meant to run on any peer,
        updating the animation locally. Next, we change the original behavior to send out an event
        to all peers invoking the new behavior.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Modify the behavior TriggeredAnimation.TriggerAnimation to just invoke the new behavior.
        <pre>
-- use ChannelHelp
require "ChannelHelp"
</pre>
        <pre>
function TriggerAnimation(self, params)
    bapiOnline.SendViewEvent(ChannelHelp.GetMainChannel(), self, "RemoteTriggerAnimation", params, 0.0)
end
</pre>

        <p class="indent1">This catches the TriggerAnimation event (which is sent from other
        behaviors as appropriate&mdash;on collision with an avatar, in the case of the treasure
        chest, for example) on the host and posts the RemoteTriggerAnimation event (which you just
        added) to any and all replicated entities.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Make the colored avatars appear. This requires overriding the OnCreate behavior for the
    BgAvatar model to contain the following:
        <pre>
-- lifecycle Behavior
function OnCreate(self, params)
    local peerID = params:GetUInt32()
    local kfmAsset = params:GetString()
    self.KfmAsset = kfmAsset
end
</pre>

        <p class="indent1">The desired property values are passed to OnCreate from the C++ code in
        GamePlayingState::CreateAvatar.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Testing Your Changes</h2>

<p><span class="NDLGUILabel">Save all</span> changes, if you have not already done so.</p>

<p>From Toolbench, choose the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Game&gt;Reset Game</span> menu option to
reset both game instances. You should now see colored avatars and proper animations working on both
the Host and Peer instance of the game. (There are still a few details to iron out - see the full
Peer Game demo for a more polished result.)</p>

<h2>Moving on...</h2>

<p>This concludes the Peer Game tutorial. To further investigate the online features in Gamebryo
LightSpeed, you can check out the full <a href="sso_peer_game_demo.htm">Peer Game demo</a>, which
builds on the Base Game demo by adding the ability to host games and have other users connect to
them.</p>

<p>You can also check out Kickstart, a project from Emergent Labs. Kickstart extends Gamebryo LightSpeed
by providing libraries, tools, and game samples that are designed to support your rapid prototyping
needs and reduce the time that it takes you to create a first playable. Kickstart demonstrates
Gamebryo LightSpeed best practices, provides samples that are easy to follow and update, and
includes useful library code in both C++ and scripting languages.</p>
