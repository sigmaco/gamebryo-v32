<h1>XSI Plug-in Release Notes</h1>

<p>For information about the XSI versions that are supported in this Gamebryo release, see <a href=
"XSI_Supported_Versions.htm">XSI Plug-in: Supported Versions</a>.</p>

Bugs</a></p>

<a name="Added_Features_and_Fixed_Bugs" id="Added_Features_and_Fixed_Bugs"></a><h2>Added Features, Changed Behavior, and Fixed Bugs</h2>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.2</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None in this release.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Adding support for XSI 7.5.</li>

    <li>Fixed a bug where exporting only the current selection would cause XSI to crash.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Adding support for XSI 7.0.</li>

    <li>A GamebryoAlphaBlending property set has been added to control alpha blending. A button to
    add this property set has been added to the GamebryoExportToolbar.</li>

    <li>A GamebryoVertexColor property set has been added to control vertex coloring. A button to
    add this property set has been added to the GamebryoExportToolbar.</li>

    <li>Fixed a bug where changing the path for a process or export script could put XSI in a bad
    state, preventing future exports.</li>

    <li>Fixed a bug where modifying a process or export script before the XSI Plug-in loaded put
    XSI in a bad state, preventing future exports.</li>

    <li>XSI no longer crashes when a timelock has expired.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.6</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The exporter is packaged as an XSI workgroup</li>

    <li>Z-buffer rendering properties can be specified per object</li>

    <li>Custom parameters attached to objects in a scene create <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiExtraData</span> objects on corresponding Gamebryo scene graph nodes. This
    feature creates an easy path for adding application-specific metadata to XSI art assets</li>

    <li>Export options allow you to export selected portions of a scene; you can also choose which
    runtime platform you're targeting with an export</li>

    <li>Level-of-detail rendering properties can be specified per object</li>

    <li>Shadowing properties can be assigned to drive the Gamebryo shadowing system</li>

    <li>Lighting can be controlled through the use of light groups. These groups define the set of
    objects that are affected by a light</li>

    <li>Clips in the XSI Animation Mixer are exported in a manner that allows extraction via the
    <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Controller_Extractor.htm">Gamebryo Controller Extractor
    Plug-in</a>. This enables use of the <a href=
    "../../Tools/Animation_Tool/Animation_Tool_Overview.htm">Gamebryo Animation Tool</a> to control
    transitions and blends between animation sequences</li>

    <li>Additional lighting parameters are exported (attenuation, falloff, animated color and
    intensity)</li>

    <li><a href="ABV.htm">Alternate Bounding Volumes (ABVs)</a> for scene objects can be specified
    to drive the Gamebryo collision system</li>

    <li>The two XSI plug-ins that make up the Gamebryo XSI Exporter are listed in the XSI NetView
    (Alt+5) under the add-ons tab.</li>

    <li>During export, a mesh profile can be specified to control how data streams are
    processed.</li>

    <li>The Gamebryo XSI Exporter plug-in predefines the custom properties it uses to drive
    exporter behavior. This makes it easier to automate the creation of this metadata. Refer to the
    screenshot below of the XSI Plugin Manager to see the predefined custom property sets.

<a name="Known_Issues_and_Limitations" id="Known_Issues_and_Limitations"></a><h2>Known issues and limitations</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Export of Bone / Skin LOD requires the SceneGraphOptimization plug-in.</li>

    <li>If XSI is not installed before the Crosswalk SDK, errors will occur during export -
    textures and animations will not be handled properly.</li>

    <li>The default material created by assigning a GamebryoMaterial is created with a base texture
    assigned that is a type not supported by Gamebryo. Either turn the base map OFF or change this
    texture to a type that is supported before exporting.</li>

    <li>The XSI exporter does not support anisotropic filtering as a texture export option at this
    time.</li>

    <li>The XSI exporter currently creates the POSITION, NORMAL, and TEXCOORD streams with the
    CPU_READ access flag. This may lead to performance penalties.</li>

    <li>The XSI exporter does not support adding shape animations to the animation mixer. This
    prevents shape animations from being used with the Controller Extractor plug-in.</li>

    <li>Nesting an XSI object containing a GamebryoLOD property within another XSI object that
    contains a GamebryoLOD property does not work. If this is done, neither object will be
    displayed.</li>

    <li>The GamebryoMaterial allows the simultaneous assignment of more textures to a single
    material than Gamebryo currently supports. If more textures are assigned than Gamebryo
    supports, the error shader will be used instead of the material.</li>

    <li>If Gamebryo lighting/shadows are applied to objects that contain multiple LOD, the
    generated shadows may not render as expected.</li>

    <li>When you are using the IK interactor for animation, keyframes must currently be assigned
    for all of the bones that the interactor is changing, not just the interactor itself.</li>

    <li>Vertex data is not unique when exporting from XSI - that is, there may be duplicate
    vertices. This can have memory and speed implications.</li>

    <li>When an export fails, sometimes the following error message will display:

        <p class="indent1"><span class="NDLSystemFont">Cannot read XML log file</span></p>

        <p class="indent1">To see the real error, specify a log file during export and view the
        contents of that file.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Assigning a Gamebryo-specific parameter (GamebryoLOD, GamebryoLighting) to a selection only
    assigns the parameter to the first item in the selection.</li>

    <li>Sometimes animating a model that contains non-uniform scaling does not work and gives an
    error.</li>

    <li>Exporting a file from XSI without the .nif extension fails. Make sure the .nif extension is
    specified when doing an export.</li>

    <li>Do not use the "LightSun" primitive preset. Crosswalk exports, including both Gamebryo NIF
    and generic .xsi exports, will cause XSI to crash.</li>
</ul>
