<h1>Creating Custom Tool Plug-ins</h1>

<p>Constructing a script out of tool plug-ins gives you 
 more control on how content is processed before being used in a game or 
 application. The tool plug-in framework is even more powerful when you 
 create custom tool plug-ins.</p>

<p>Because the tool plug-in framework dynamically loads 
 all tool plug-ins from dll files in the tool plug-ins' directory, new 
 tool plug-ins can easily be added by just dropping a new plug-in dll into 
 that location. Once a new tool plug-in has been created, adding it to 
 a script to have it automatically executed on each export is trivial.</p>

<p>In the most common case, tool plug-ins are used to manipulate 
 the scenegraph, report some information from it, or save it out to a file. 
 However, tool plug-ins can really do anything that you want to be an automatic 
 part of the art asset pipeline.</p>

<p>When a tool plug-in is used in a script on export, it 
 is passed the scene graph that was exported. It has the ability to make 
 any changes to the scene. This enables a custom tool plug-in to do things 
 like add entirely new objects to the scene, or extract certain objects 
 from the scene into separate files.</p>

<h4>How to get started</h4>

<p>Gamebryo ships with sample code for 4 very basic tool 
 plug-ins; one for each type (import, process, viewer, and export). The 
 code for these samples can be used as a starting point for creating your 
 own custom tool plug-ins. You can find these plugins in the following location:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Samples\SampleLibs\SamplePluginsDLL.</span></p>

<p>Note that a single DLL can contain any number of plug-ins 
and that the plug-ins are loaded when the <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetPlugins</span> function is called 
 on DLL load.</p>

<p>Once you know what type of plug-in you want to make, 
 all you have to do is create a new class that is derived from the abstract 
 class matching your type of plugin and implement the required functions. 
 This should be straightforward given the example code.</p>
