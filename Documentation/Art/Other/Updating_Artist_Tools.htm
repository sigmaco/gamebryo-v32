<h1>Updating Artist Tools</h1>

<p>It is not uncommon for studios to rebuild all or part of the Gamebryo engine at some point in
their development process, or add new shaders, shader libraries, or tool plugins. This can lead to
difficulties when the artists are using inconsistent versions of the Gamebryo libraries and assets
to create art content. The script UpdateArtistTools.bat, installed under
<em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Source\Tools\UpdateArtistTools, was provided to help studios update their
Gamebryo art tools on a target machine from a single source, often located on the network.</p>

<h2>Environment Variables</h2>

<p>The UpdateArtistTools.bat script uses a series of environment variables</p>

<ul>
    <li>GAMEBRYO_DEPOT (Required): This variable is the only one that must be explicitly set,
    either on the target machine or by editing the script itself. This variable is a path to the
    root of a built version of Gamebryo.</li>

    <li>EMERGENT_PATH (Required): This variable is set during a Gamebryo installation. It specifies
    the location of the Gamebryo installation, and serves as a reference to the location of the
    Gamebryo DLLs, shader libraries, tool plugins, and shader files.</li>

    <li>MAXINSTALLPATH[X] (Optional): This variable is set during a Gamebryo installation. If it is
    defined, then it points to the root of a 3ds max installation. The UpdateArtistTools.bat will
    use this variable to update the Gamebryo plugin for 3ds Max if it is defined. If it is not
    defined, then it will not attempt to perform this update.

        <p class="indent1">The [X] in the name of the variable should be replaced with the version
        number of Max that the variable corresponds to. The valid values are 2008, 2009, and 2010.
        For example, to have the update apply to your Max 2010 installation, create a variable
        called MAXINSTALLPATH2010 that points to the install location of Max 2010. Multiple
        environment variables with this convention can be defined if you wish to update multiple
        Max versions at once.</p>
    </li>

    <li>MAYAINSTALLPATH[X] (Optional): This variable is set during a Gamebryo installation. If it
    is defined, then it points to the root of a Maya installation. The UpdateArtistTools.bat will
    use this variable to update the Gamebryo plugin for Maya if it is defined. If it is not
    defined, then it will not attempt to perform this update.

        <p class="indent1">As with Max, the [X] in the name of the variable should be replaced with
        2008, 2009, and 2010. Multiple environment variables with this convention can be defined if
        you wish to update multiple Maya versions at once.</p>
    </li>

    <li>XSIINSTALLPATH[X] (Optional): This variable is set during a Gamebryo installation. If it is
    defined, then it points to the root of an XSI installation. The UpdateArtistTools.bat will use
    this variable to update the Gamebryo plugin for Maya if it is defined. If it is not defined,
    then it will not attempt to perform this update.

        <p class="indent1">As with Max and Maya, The [X] in the name of the variable should be
        replaced with the version number of XSI that the variable corresponds to. The valid values
        are 65, 70, and 75. Multiple environment variables with this convention can be defined if
        you wish to update multiple Maya versions at once.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Using the Script</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Provide a built version of Gamebryo that is readable by the target machine. This can be
    either local to the target machine or over a network.</li>

    <li>Update the GAMEBRYO_DEPOT environment variable to point to the root of the built version of
    Gamebryo. If the environment variable is not set on the target machine when the script is run,
    the script will provide its own. This allows the environment variable to be set either in the
    script or on the target machine.</li>

    <li>Quit any applications, including 3ds max or Maya, that may be using any of the Gamebryo
    libraries or files that will be updated.</li>

    <li>Be sure all the Gamebryo libraries and files that will be updated have write
    privileges.</li>

    <li>Run the UpdateArtistTools.bat from the target machine.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What the Script Does</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Update the Gamebryo DLLs located at %EMERGENT_PATH%\sdk\Win32\DLL.</li>

    <li>Update the Gamebryo ToolPlugins located at %EMERGENT_PATH%\SDK\Win32\DLL\ToolPlugins.</li>

    <li>Update the Shaders located at %EMERGENT_PATH%\Media\Shaders.</li>

    <li>Update the AnimationTool, SceneViewer, Toolbench (including World Builder
    and Entity Modeling Tool) and on-target viewer application executables.</li>

    <li>Update the 3ds Max, Maya, and XSI plugins for those versions of the artist tools that were
    found.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What the Script Does Not Do</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Build the Gamebryo engine.</li>

    <li>Set up or modify any environment variables normally associated with a Gamebryo
    installation.</li>
</ul>
