<h1>Understanding Animation Sequences</h1>


<p>Gamebryo is specially designed for character animation. 
 Using the Gamebryo Max and Maya plugins, you can create characters and 
 define animation sequences. These sequences are the different animations 
 the character can perform: walk, run, attack, and so on. Using the Gamebryo 
 Animation Tool, you will be able to seamlessly blend the animation sequences, 
 creating top quality interactive characters. During export, the character 
 animations are separated from the character art, creating a .NIF (art 
 file) and a .KF (animation file). Separating the art from the animation 
 does two things: reduce memory/disk size and allows for animation reuse. 
 </p>

<p>For example, suppose you had three different monsters, 
 red Ogres, green Ogres, and Blue Ogres, that look different and have different 
 skins, but they have the same bone structure. Because they share the same 
 bone structure, they all can share the same walk, run and attack sequences.</p>

<p>Character Sequences are composed of several hierarchical pieces. At the top level is the Character Root. The Character Root has exactly one Accumulation Root. The Character Root also has a collection of Layer Roots. Every Layer Root can have a collection of Sequences. The Sequences can have collections of either Morph Keys, or Text Keys. Below is a diagram that shows these relationships.</p>

<p>The Character Root exists in Max and Maya as a Dag Node. 
 All of a Character Roots Layer Roots, Sequences, Text Keys and Morph Keys, 
 must refer to objects that exist in the scene graph below the Character 
 Root, or in other words, must be descendants of the Character Root.</p>

<h4>Accumulation Root</h4>

<p>There can only be one Accumulation Root in a scene. 
 The Accumulation Root is a node that will, as the name implies, accumulate 
 animation. The accumulation root is used heavily for animations such as 
 walk cycles. In your typical walk cycle a sequence will be set up to loop 
 so the character can continue to walk for as long as needed. However, 
 after each loop the character should not snap back to the origin, but 
 should continue walking from the spot where the last walk animation ended. 
 To accomplish this feat, animation accumulation is necessary. With animation 
 accumulation set to accumulate translation for the walk cycle sequence, 
 all of the translation on the Accumulation Root would accumulate each 
 time the animation is played. In other words, if the Accumulation Root 
 translated from 0 to 10 the first time the animation was played, it would 
 translate from 10 to 20 the next time the animation is played.</p>

<p>Since it possible to set accumulation for some attributes 
 but not others the Accumulation Root is split into two nodes on export. 
 One will receive all of the accumulation animation, and the other receives 
 all of the animation that does not accumulate. The creation of the special 
 non-accumulation node has some important consequences for exporting sequences 
 from multiple files. If one file was exported with the controller extractor 
 and the other was not, upon export, their scene graphs will be different. 
 This will cause errors if one attempts to use sequences (.kf files) exported 
 from one file, with the character (.nif files) exported from a scene that 
 did not use the controller extractor.</p>

<p>Another import caveat is to be careful to not put a 
 skinned mesh below the Accumulation Node. If a skin mesh is below the 
 Accumulation Node in the hierarchy it will be double transformed from 
 both the bones and the accumulation node.</p>

<h4>Layer Roots</h4>

<p>Sometimes it can be useful to combine two animations. 
 For instance, a character could be running and then receive a phone call. 
 Using layered animation, the running animation could continue to play 
 as the phone answering animation was layered over it. To accomplish this 
 task, a Layer Root would be created at the characters shoulder. The Layer 
 Root would store sequence information that would affect all nodes that 
 were descendants of the Layer Root, such as rotation on the elbow and 
 the wrist. When the sequences are activated they are given a priority 
 number. If two sequences are playing with the same priority their values 
 are blended together. Otherwise, if the priorities are different the sequence 
 with the highest priority controls the node. In the case of the character 
 running and answering his cell phone, the cell phone answering animation 
 would have to be activated with a higher priority so it could wholly control 
 the arm.</p>

<h4>Sequences</h4>

<p>Sequences contain a collection of animation data for 
 a group of nodes. Every sequence has a start and end time, along with 
 looping and accumulation information. </p>

<h4>Text Keys</h4>

<p>Sometimes, an artist will be required to embed information 
 in the scene graph to be used later. The Text Key Window allows you to 
 create strings and associate them with particular frames. By selecting 
 a node in the scene graph and using the &quot;Create Text Key&quot; icon, 
 you can create text keys. For example, you may create text keys for each 
 frame your characters feet hit the ground. The programmer could use this 
 &quot;Step Sound&quot; later to determine when and where to play the proper 
 sound. The practical uses for text keys are almost endless. </p>

<h4>Morph Tags</h4>

<p>Within the Gamebryo animation system, it is possible 
 to Morph one animation into another. For example, say your character has 
 two sequences, walk and run, and you want the character to transition 
 smoothly from walking to running. If the morphing system knows when the 
 two sequences are equivalent (e.g., &quot;The right foot is down.&quot;), 
 it would be able to morph smoothly from one animation sequence to the 
 next. The Morph Tag window allows you to specify particular frames, so 
 the morphing system knows where the animations are suppose to match up. 
 It is important to remember that Morph tags need to be placed on the same 
 node as your sequences. Internally, Morph Tags are stored as a NiTextKey, 
 and the string &quot;morph:&quot; is pre-pended to the morph tag name.</p>
