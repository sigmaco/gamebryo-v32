<h1>Texture Sharing</h1>

<p>Gamebryo supports a variety of compressed and palletized 
 textures including BMP and DDS. Since Gamebryo can't directly read all 
 formats supported by Maya the Plug-in must get the pixel data for the 
 texture directly from Maya. In this case, during export the Gamebryo plug-in 
 will convert all textures to a 32-bit uncompressed format.</p>

<h4>External Textures</h4>

<p>To facilitate the sharing of textures between NIF files, 
 the Gamebryo Maya plug-in can create NIF files which reference textures 
 externally.</p>

<h4>Sharing Texture Maps</h4>

<p>The Gamebryo Maya Plug-in attempts to share the texture 
 data between Maya materials.&nbsp; For example, you could have ten different 
 Maya materials for the walls in your game.&nbsp; Each material uses the 
 same texture for the detail map.&nbsp; When the NIF file is created, all 
 ten materials will share the same pixel data for their detail map.</p>

<h4>Exporting Textures</h4>

<p>Textures can be exported inside the main NIF, separate 
 NIFs, and in their original form. Exporting to separate NIFs or to the 
 original textures has many advantages that can help accelerate performance. 
 </p>

<p>External textures can be shared across multiple NIFs, 
 saving disk space.</p>

<p>External textures that are shared can save huge amounts 
 of your video ram.&nbsp; When Texture objects are encountered during NIF 
 loading, the renderer is responsible for doing the file loading in the 
 event that external files are already being used and are resident.&nbsp; 
 When using internal textures an additional copy of the NiPixelData is 
 stored in memory, which is a huge memory waste.</p>

<p>If the files are exported as external or separate NIF, 
 the options for texture formatting are available.&nbsp; These texture-formatting 
 options can add additional performance benefits for the console platforms 
 by pre-computing the textures to a format the target platform can handle.</p>

<p>Internal textures are a convenient way to have an all 
 in one package and are useful when doing testing or for easy transfer 
 of data.</p>
