<h1>Static Lighting </h1>


<p>There are many ways to optimize your lights so it looks 
 like you have many lights in your scene when you only have one or two 
 dynamic lights.&nbsp; This technique is called Static lighting.&nbsp; 
 You &quot;burn&quot; lighting into your geometry on a vertex or pixel 
 level ahead of time, giving it the appearance of being lit.&nbsp; This 
 technique is how most engines get such nice lighting while running at 
 a decent frame rate. Static lighting can be done on a vertex level by 
 painting the vertices or on a pixel level when you need very detailed 
 shadows by assigning dark or light maps to your materials.</p>

<p><b>Use vertex colors</b>.&nbsp; 
 By setting vertex colors, you can light each individual object uniquely 
 without having to consider the expense of many dynamic lights.&nbsp; The 
 drawback of this feature is that your mesh may need more tessellation 
 to prevent artifacts of the vertex lighting from showing. </p>

<p><b>Use dark maps.</b>&nbsp; 
 In this case, you can use a small texture with tiling on the whole surface 
 of an object, and use a separate texture (your dark map) once across the 
 same surface.&nbsp; In general, the need to have a highly detailed dark 
 map is not very common, so this technique can be a great solution.</p>

<p>When lights are not moving in a scene, try to avoid 
 dynamic lighting.&nbsp;Use vertex colors or dark maps.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Burn the complex lighting ahead of time by creating 
 your lights normally. Use a Max or Maya tool that is specialized to burn 
 your lighting into the geometry like &quot;Assign vertex colors&quot;, 
 &quot;Vertex paint&quot; or &quot;Advanced lighting \ Radiosity Solution&quot;. 
 Set the material to show the finalized dark maps or vertex colors. For 
 completely static geometry the mode in the Gamebryo Shader should be set 
 to &quot;Replace&quot;. You can then delete your original lighting, add 
 a few additional dynamic lights to take care of interactive elements and 
 end up with a fast but beautiful scene.&nbsp; </p>
