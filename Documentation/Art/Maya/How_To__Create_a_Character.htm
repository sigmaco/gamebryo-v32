<h1>Creating a Character</h1>

<p>This document is going to be the starting point for 
 our discussion of the basics of character creation. Furthermore, it will 
 be a jumping-off point for the discussion of the details.</p>

<h2>The Big Picture</h2>

<p>The easiest way to handle character animation in Gamebryo 
 is to use the Actor Manager. The Actor Manager is a powerful character 
 animation system that performs animation sequence playback and blending. 
 It comes with powerful artist-centric tools that let you see and customize 
 your character and animations in the Gamebryo engine without requiring 
 programmer assistance. Your character's animation will be broken into 
 specific, artist-defined sequences which represent your character's movements. 
 Sequences typically include movements like walking, running, shooting, 
 dying, turning, or anything else you desire.</p>

<p>During export, the Controller Extractor exports three 
 files for the character:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> NIF file&mdash;contains the character's skin, skeleton, and textures</li>
    <li> KF file&mdash;contains the character's animation sequences</li>
    <li> KFM file&mdash;contains blending information</li>
  </ul>

 <p>Using the Gamebryo Animation Tool, you are able to preview your character and tweak the transitions from one sequence to the next. The Animation Tool allows you to see your character in the engine and finalize its animations.</p>

<h4>1. Create the Character Root</h4>

<p>The Character Root is the &quot;Group&quot; 
 in Maya that will completely contain the character. This turns out to 
 be handy for the programmers when they load your character, but it is 
 also useful for organization and consistency. The Character Root should 
 be created at the origin with no rotation and no scaling. It holds your 
 character's skeleton (the Accumulation Root and its joint children) along 
 with its skin.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, there are a number of reasons to 
 have a Character Root, foremost of which is that it gives the Actor Manager/Controller 
 Extractor a starting place for exporting the character. All the animations 
 under the character root are extracted into sequences and organized into 
 KF files.</p>

<h4>2. Create the Accumulation Root</h4>

<p>The Accumulation Root is a &quot;Group&quot; in Maya 
 and a child of the Character Root. It contains the character's joint hierarchy 
 (skeleton). The Accumulation Root is created at the origin with no rotation 
 and no scaling. In your application, the Accumulation Root will represent 
 the character's position.</p>

<p>The easiest way to describe the Accumulation Root is 
 to consider the simple example of a walking animation for the character 
 in the DestroyerBot.mb file. When you look at the walk sequence, the character's 
 position is animated by moving the Accumulation Root. In your game, when 
 the Actor Manager plays the walk sequence, the character movement can 
 be accumulated into the Accumulation Root. This eliminates the skating 
 feet effect that often happens with animated characters. If you animate 
 your character with a jerky motion from a pronounced limp, it will move 
 with a jerky motion and its feet will remain planted on the floor.</p>

<h4>3. Create Your Character's Skeleton</h4>

<p>Create your character's skeleton as a child of the Accumulation 
 Root. The exact form of your skeleton is really up to you. Add in locators 
 if you want attachment points for things like helmets or guns. Just name 
 them something useful so your programmers can find them later. There are 
 a few restrictions you need to keep in mind, but they shouldn't hamper 
 your creativity:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Unique Name. Everything 
 under the character root must have a unique name. The Actor Manager will 
 be matching up objects to their animations by name, so the names must 
 be unique.</li>
	
	<li>No negative scale. 
 Because of the difference between Maya and Gamebryo, you cannot use negative 
 scale.</li>
	
	<li>No non-uniform scale. 
 Because of the difference between Maya and Gamebryo, you cannot use non-uniform 
 scales with the skeleton of a skinned character. The exporter can &quot;bake&quot; 
 out non-uniform scale for non-skinned objects but NOT for skinned objects.</li>
	
	<li>Avoid Joint Orientation, 
 Rotate Axis, and Pivots. There are fundamental differences between the 
 scene graphs of Maya and Gamebryo. These options can be represented faithfully 
 but will cause bloating of the scene graph. Using quaternion sampling can avoid the extra nodes from Joint Orientation and Rotate Axis.</li>
	
	<li>XYZ Rotation Order. 
 For reasons of speed, Gamebryo only supports the XYZ rotate order.</li>
	
	<li>How will this character 
 be rendered in game? The standard fixed function pipeline limits users 
 to a maximum of 4 bones per skin partition, so your skinned character 
 can easily be broken into many separate objects for rendering, which can 
 degrade performance. In general, the fewer the bones you have, the better 
 your performance will be, and, as you know, hands can have a lot of bones. 
 Many of todays games use a custom shader to draw skinned characters, and, 
 depending on the video card, you could see 25 to 75+ bones per skinned 
 object. Your art director and engineering lead will have figured this 
 out so you can just check with them for guidance on how complex a bone 
 hierarchy to use.</li>
	
	<li>Bind Pose at Frame 
 Zero. For the sake of simplicity it is best to start the character out 
 in its bind pose at frame zero. To properly export a skinned character, 
 you must be able to return the character to its bind pose. Unfortunately, 
 in the process of creating your character it is possible to alter the 
 scene graph sufficiently such that the character can no longer return 
 to its bind pose. By setting the character in the bind pose at frame zero, 
 it is possible for the exporter to use the frame zero position of the 
 joints. In this way, it can still get bind pose information even if Maya 
 can't return the bind pose information.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Rig Your Character</h4>

<p>This step is mostly about your personal preference for 
 creating a character. You can use standard Key Frame animation. You can 
 also use Maya IK handles. It is really up to you. During export, Maya 
 will look for the animation curves generated by standard Key Frame animation. 
 If it can't find an animation curve, the Gamebryo exporter will attempt 
 to automatically bake your transform's animations.</p>

<h4>5. Decide If Your Characters Will Be Sharing Skeletons</h4>

<p>The sharing of skeletons between characters is mostly 
 a workflow question to be answered by your art director. For example, 
 if you are doing an RTS game with lots of different human characters, 
 you might want to create a standard skeletal rig. This skeleton would 
 be shared among all the different character types making an easy-to-animate, 
 consistent standard. You would include the standard rig as a Maya reference.</p>

<h4>6. Create Your Character's Skin and Texture</h4>

<p>This step is fairly straightforward. The most important 
 performance issue to consider relates to applying different materials 
 to the same object. In Maya, an object can have a different material applied 
 to each triangle. In Gamebryo every rendered object has one and only one 
 material. This means that if you create a cube with a different material 
 on each face, it will be converted into six separate objects upon export. 
 Simply put, to speed up the rendering of your character, use as few different 
 materials as possible.</p>

<h4>7. Create Your Character's Blend Shape Expressions (Optional)</h4>

<p>Use this sequence of steps if using blend shapes for 
 facial expressions. If you are using face bones then you can skip this 
 step.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Minimize 
 the number of morphing vertices. You could skin your character with a 
 single mesh and blend the entire skin just to get facial expressions. 
 This would be incredibility wasteful, and you would probably not be happy 
 with the performance. It is best to cut the mesh so that only the blending 
 vertices are a separate object. For most characters, this means cutting 
 out the face.</li>
	
	<li>Triangulate 
 the face mesh.</li>
	
	<li>Delete the 
 face mesh's history.</li>
	
	<li>Duplicate 
 the face mesh using copy for each expression blend target.</li>
	
	<li>Leave the 
 base blend target as a child of the Character Root.</li>
</ul>

<h4>7. Bind the skin to the bones.</h4>

<p>Bind the character's skin to its bones and setup your skin weights.</p>

<h4>8 Set Up Bone LOD (Optional)</h4>

<p>The Gamebryo animation system contains a valuable feature 
 called Bone LOD. Similar in principle to typical LOD, Bone LOD allows 
 you to define simpler versions of your character skeleton that can be 
 used when you don't need the visual clarity and/or you need the additional 
 performance. For example, you might be animating facial expressions using 
 bones. If the character is 300 yards away from the camera and only 30 
 pixels high, you can animate the character's skin using a simplified skeleton. 
 At those sizes you might also want to remove the influence of individual 
 fingers. If you are creating a single Maya file character, setting 
 up Bone LOD can be done later.</p>

<h4>9. Setup Skin LOD (Optional)</h4>

<p>The Gamebryo animation system contains a valuable feature 
 called Skin LOD. Similar in principle to Bone LOD. Skin LOD allows you 
 to define simplified skins that will be used in conjunction with Bone 
 LOD. If your character is 300 yards away from the camera and only 30 pixels 
 high, you really don't need to use a high polygon count skin. If you are 
 creating a single Maya file character, then setting up Skin LOD can be done later.</p>

<h4>10. Decide: Single Maya File Character OR Multiple 
 Maya File Character</h4>

<p>The decision to go single or multiple Maya files is 
 half personal preference and half practicality. A single Maya file character 
 keeps things organized, makes changes easy, and gives you the most reliable 
 art pipeline because there are less steps to go wrong. Conversely, a single 
 Maya file can be enormous and can make Maya unusable.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Number of Sequences; 
 If you have a dozen or so short sequences you can probably keep your character 
 in a single Maya file. A couple thousand frames of animation will take 
 a few seconds to export and view but that isn't unreasonable.</li>
	
	<li>Mocap Data: Animations 
 created with Mocap data can be truly huge. Just image a Maya file with 
 a Gigabyte of mocap animation and it will probably give new meaning to 
 the term slide show.</li>
	
	<li>Number of Animators: 
 Simply put, you cannot have a dozen animators working with the same Maya 
 file.</li>
</ul>
