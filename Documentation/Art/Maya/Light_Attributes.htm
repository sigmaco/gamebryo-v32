<h1>Light Attributes</h1>

<p>Gamebryo Directional Lights have the same color and 
 dimmer attributes found in point and spot lights, but directional lights 
 do not attenuate in intensity.</p>

		<tr>
			<td class="ColSpan" colspan="2">Basic</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>Ambient Color</td>
			<td>Set
the color that the light produces over the ambient channel. This
lighting component is different from lights in Maya that only produce
light on the diffuse channel. This value is stored in the attribute
Ni_AmbientColor.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Specular Color</td>
			<td>Set
the color that the light produces over the specular channel. This
lighting component is different from lights in Maya that only produce
lights on the diffuse channel. This value is stored in the attribute
Ni_SpecularColor.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="ColSpan" colspan="2">Attenuation</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>Use Maya Decay Rate</td>
			<td>Use
the simple attenuation/decay rate found in Maya: none, linear,
quadratic, and cubic. When you select this checkbox, the following
Gamebryo attenuation "Extra Attributes" will be ignored: Constant
Attenuation, Linear Attenuation, and Quadratic Attenuation. This value
is stored in the attribute Ni_UseMayaDecayRate.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Dimmer</td>
			<td>Control the intensity of the light from 0.0 (off) to 1.0 (on full). This value is stored in the attribute Ni_Dimmer.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Constant Attenuation, Linear Attenuation, and Quadratic Attenuation</td>
			<td>Control
how far the illumination from a light will extend. Each of these values
is a parameter in the distance function used by the light. For the
advanced artist who wants full control, these are the actual values
used in the Gamebryo diffuse lighting equation. In reality, setting
these values by hand is difficult and can be confusing. By using the
"Gamebryo Light Attenuation" dialog, these values can be set
automatically, using a format that is straightforward and easy to use.
These values are stored in attributes Ni_ConstantAttenuation,
Ni_LinearAttenuation, and Ni_QuadraticAttenuation. </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Set Attenuation By Distance</td>
			<td>Determine attenuation based on distance instead of the constant, linear, and quadratic values above.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Near Zero Distance</td>
			<td>Specify the attenuation by providing a distance at which the light will only have one percent influence.
<div class="NDLTDNote"><span class="NDLTableNote">Note:</span> 
Gamebryo lights attenuate using an inverse quadratic equation which means the influence of a light never actually reaches zero.</div>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="ColSpan" colspan="2">Shadowing</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>Shadow Technique&nbsp;
</td>
			<td>Choose the shadow technique for creating shadows. The
different techniques are provided to adjust the balance of performance
and quality. Depth Mapped shadows must be turned on for the shadow
technique to be used. The values for this attribute are stored in
GbShadowTechniqueName and GbShadowTechnique.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Static Shadows</td>
			<td>Allow
the runtime to make optimizations based on the assumption that
shadowing light and all of the casters will not be moving. This allows
the light to reuse the same shadow map without having to render each
frame. The benefit of using this over static lighting is that the
shadow receivers can be dynamic. This value is stored in the attribute
GbStaticShadows.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Use Automatic Bias</td>
			<td>Control
how bias is set. When the checkbox is selected (checked), bias is
automatically set to a reasonable default to eliminate shadow mapping
that can cause artifacts around edges of objects or at object
intersections. Deselect (uncheck) this option if you prefer to use a
custom bias. To use a custom bias, you can use the Maya's DMap Bias
parameter in the Shadows rollout to determine how much the shadow map
will shift shadows away from or towards the casting light source. This
value is stored in the attribute GbUseAutomaticBias.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Use Backfaces</td>
			<td>Set
which side of the shadow casting object gets used to generate the
shadow map. When the checkbox is selected (checked), the backfaces of
the casters are the faces that cast the shadows. This reduces the
shadowing artifacts on object edges, but it can cause some objects not
to be shadowed when you expect them to. For example, shadows might not
appear properly when an object is inside another or in the case of one
sided planes. This value is stored in the attribute GbUseBackfaces.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Force Map Size</td>
			<td>Set
the relationship between a light and its shadow map. When a shadow
casting light is converted, Maya's DMap Resolution attribute will
determine what the desired size of the shadow map will be. However,
once running in Gamebryo, it may be more efficient to reuse a shadow
map of a different resolution instead of creating a new one to match
the desired size. This improves performance, but it may lead to lower
quality results. If it is important that a particular light always get
the exact size of shadow map that it wants, the Force Map Size option
can be turned on. This value is stored in the attribute GbForceMapSize.</td>
