<h1>Transparency in Gamebryo </h1>


<p>Transparency is a feature required in many situations. The Gamebryo Maya Plug-in provides two ways to accomplish this effect.</p>

<h4>Material Alpha</h4>

<p>The transparency value is set for the entire object uniformly. You set this option in the Material Sub-Panel of a <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMultiShader</span> node.</p>

<h4>Texture Alpha</h4>

<p>Transparency is contained in the alpha channel of the texture. Note that if the texture you are using has an alpha channel, the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in automatically uses that alpha channel to alpha blend its opacity.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, because of limitations imposed by Maya, standard Maya textures only support alpha blending, or in Gamebryo parlance, the blending uses Source: Source Alpha, and Destination: Inverse Source Alpha. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMultiShader</span> material supports the full range of transparency options.</p>

<h2>Sorting in the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in</h2>

<p>When using alpha blending, you should be aware of sorting. 
 Sorting is a process that rearranges the draw order such that more distant 
 objects are drawn before closer objects. Gamebryo only does inter-object 
 sorting, not intra-object sorting. When two non-opaque objects are drawn, 
 Gamebryo tries to ensure that the more distant object will be drawn first. 
 It sorts objects back-to-front by comparing the camera's distance from 
 the center of each object. </p>

<p>When a single object is being drawn, the individual 
 triangles that form it are not themselves sorted, posing a possible problem 
 when rendering transparent objects that have both a back and front, like 
 a transparent tube. If issues arise, you may want to consider splitting 
 the object in two-pieces or setting its Z-buffer mode manually.</p>

<h2>The Z-buffer in the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in</h2>

<p>A fast way to render opaque geometry is to use a Zbuffer.&nbsp; 
 A Zbuffer is an additional channel in the frame buffer that stores the 
 distance of the drawn object from the camera.&nbsp; In other words, each 
 pixel written to the frame buffer has an associated view-distance.&nbsp; 
 When rendering an object, we first check to see if the pixel we are drawing 
 is closer to the camera than the pixel already in the buffer. Called a 
 &quot;Test&quot;. If so, then we write the new pixel to the frame buffer 
 with the new view distance, which is called a &quot;Write&quot;.&nbsp; 
 If not, we skip that pixel because it is behind geometry that has already 
 been drawn.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Zbuffer technique can produce incorrect 
 results for two or more objects that are close to each other, but far 
 away from the camera. In this case, you may see a more distant object 
 showing through a closer object. A 32-bit Zbuffer can usually solve this 
 problem. However, this option is not available on all graphics cards. 
 It is often useful to manually set the Zbuffer during rendering. In the 
 Gamebryo Maya Plug-in, the Zbuffer is on by default. In most cases, you'll 
 want to turn off writing to the Zbuffer for rendering alpha-blended objects. 
 Gamebryo controls the Zbuffer via the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiZBufferProperty</span>. 
 Since Maya does not have equivalent functionality, the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in 
 creates these properties using an &quot;Extra Attribute&quot;. There are 
 four different options that will turn on/off both Zbuffer testing and 
 Zbuffer writing. When testing is off, all objects will draw their pixels, 
 even if the pixels are overwriting a closer object that has already been 
 drawn. When writing is off, objects won't set the distance for their pixels 
 into the Zbuffer.</p>
