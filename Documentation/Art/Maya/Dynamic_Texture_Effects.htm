<h1>Projected Texture Effects</h1>

<p>You can use projected texture effects to create a number of
different effects, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>projected lights</li>

    <li>projected shadows</li>

    <li>environment maps</li>
</ul>

<p>You create projected texture effects in Maya by using a
Dynamic Texture Light. Click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Create
Dynamic Texture Lights</span> button on Maya's Gamebryo shelf.
Information is stored in the Extra Attributes of the light, so
the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in can recognize it as a dynamic texture
light. Light linking in Maya's Relationship Editor is used to
determine what objects are affected by the dynamic texture
effect.</p>

<p>Projected texture effects are both powerful in what they can
do and expensive to compute during the game. It is important to
limit the number of affected objects.</p>

<h2>Setting the Projected Texture</h2>

<p>To set the texture of the dynamic light, connect the light's
color attribute to a file texture.</p>

<h4>Projected Lights</h4>

<p>Projected light maps are used for effects like a slide
projector or a stained glass window. There are two types of
projected lights: a perspective projected type, where the image
is projected from a single nearby point (e.g., a slide
projector), and a parallel projected type, where the image is
projected from far away (e.g., a stained glass window).</p>

<h4>Projected Shadows</h4>

<p>Projected shadow maps are very similar to projected light
maps, except that when projected shadow maps overlap, they become
darker. This behavior makes for more realistic shadow-to-shadow
interaction. Like light maps, projected shadow maps come in both
perspective and parallel varieties (for limits specified on those
lights, please see the section on Projected Light Maps).</p>

<p>Gamebryo supports dynamic projected shadow maps (e.g., the
shadow of a moving character is computed and cast onto the
floor), but these dynamic projected shadow maps cannot,
currently, be created in the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in. Therefore, to
check to see if something is correctly displayed, you will have
to get your programmer to enable dynamically computed projected
shadow maps.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Gamebryo export supports dynamic shader
based shadows that can perform even more complicated shadowing
techniques.</p>

<h4>Environment Maps</h4>

<p>Environment maps are r,g,b maps that are added to the base
texture to simulate mirror-like reflection of the environment
surrounding the mapped object. Often used with a gloss map, this
effect can be very striking, giving a very realistic impression
of a mirrored object.</p>

<p>The two most common coordinate types are specular cube map,
and spherical. The choice of coordinate map is determine mostly
by art work and hardware requirements. Since both Gamebryo and
many different types of graphics hardware support six image cross
DDS cube map format, this is a very popular of way of making cube
maps.</p>

<p>An object may have only one environment map applied at a
time. Currently, if more than one environment map is applied to
the same object, any one of the environment maps may be used.
Applications should not depend upon any particular behavior in
this case, and should avoid it whenever possible.</p>
