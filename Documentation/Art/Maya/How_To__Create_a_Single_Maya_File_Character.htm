<h1>Creating a Single Maya File Character</h1>

<h4>1. Start in the Bind Pose</h4>

<p>As a rule of thumb it is best to start the character off at
frame zero in the bind pose. To properly export the relationship
between skin and bones, it is necessary to get the skeleton back
into its bind pose. As you are using Maya, it is possible to
alter the scene graph so the skeleton can no longer get back to
its bind pose. By starting the character in the bind pose, you
may circumvent some of these problems.</p>

<h4>2. Create a Sequence</h4>

<p>Start by clicking the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Create
Character Sequence</span> button.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/MyImmerseSequenceIcon.png" width="32"
    height="32" alt="MyImmerseSequenceIcon (1K)">

    <p class="FigureCaption">Create Sequence button</p>
</div>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/SequenceEditorShowingEveryt.gif" width="627"
    height="346" alt="SequenceEditorShowingEveryt (14K)">

    <p class="FigureCaption">Sequence Editor</p>
</div>

<p>Select the object in your scene that you want as the Character
Root. In the Character Roots section, click on the <span class=
"NDLGUILabel">Add Selected</span> button. This will set the
Character Root as the Accumulation Root by default. Additionally
a Character Root is also a Layer Root.</p>

<p>In the Sequence Window, click the <span class=
"NDLGUILabel">Add</span> button and set your sequence name. It is
important to remember that every sequence name must be unique.
The programmers will be using the sequence name when they start
animations in the game. Enter the start frame, and the end frame
and set the appropriate check boxes for the animation.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of sequences: full body and layer. A layer
sequence only affects part of the character and can be played on
top of other sequences. When you look at the DestroyerBot
example, there are full body animations for walking and running,
but there are also layer sequences for firing lasers, missiles,
and flares. Gamebryo's Actor Manager allows you to play both
animations simultaneously. This reduces the number of animations
you need to produce and adds flexibility. Creating a Layer
Sequence is just like creating a full body one except that you
select a different root node in Maya before you click the
<span class="NDLGUILabel">Create Character Sequence</span>
button. In the DestroyerBot example, the layer sequences are on
the | DestroyerBot | Accumulation_Root | Hips | Body node. It is
important to remember that only the Layer Root and its children
will be part of the Layer Sequence.</p>

<h4>3. Create an Animation</h4>

<p>Creating your character animations is fairly straightforward
using either key frame animation or IK animation. Since your
character is in its bind pose at frame zero, you need to pick a
range of frames to hold your animation. For example, the
DestroyerBot's walk animation goes from frame 336 to 384. There
are a couple of things to consider:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Only animate the attributes you will be changing. It
    seems obvious, but it is worth mentioning that the fastest
    animated attributes are the ones that aren't animated.</li>

    <li>
        <p>IK Solver Stability: By default Gamebryo samples
        rotation with quaternions, which prevents flipping.
        However, if euler angles are used instead, the animation
        should be prebaked inside Maya and after which the artist
        should apply an euler filter to the rotation curves. The
        explanation that follows only applies if quaternion
        sampling is turned off.</p>

        <p>Since Gamebryo only supports key frame animation, it
        is necessary for the exporter to automatically "bake"
        your animation. Between two consecutive frames, it is
        possible for an IK solver to choose a radically different
        solution. For example, it might use a 180 degree X
        rotation one frame and then use a -180 degree X rotation
        the next. These rapid transitions happen between frames
        in Maya, but they can appear as a flash in Gamebryo.
        Setting joint limits should help alleviate the problem
        but may not completely eliminate it.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Keep at least one frame between the end of one sequence
    and the beginning of the next. Most of the time, the ending
    position of one sequence isn't the beginning position of the
    next. If you leave one frame between the sequences, then it
    will give you time to get from one pose to the next. Once
    your animations are created, you can fix this problem, but it
    is annoying and easy to avoid in the first place.</li>

    <li>Create a key for everything animated on your character at
    the beginning and at the end of your sequence. This will
    prevent the changes you make in this sequence from affecting
    other sequences.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Build Remaining Sequences</h4>

<p>Just keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until you have created all
of your sequences.</p>

<h4>5. Set Character Compression Options (Optional)</h4>

<p>The Gamebryo Maya exporter can attempt to automatically reduce
the size of your animation data using B-spline curve fitting and
compact keys. Just select the Accumulation Root and click the
<span class="NDLGUILabel">Character Animation Compression</span>
button.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src=
    "images/MyImmerseCreateCharacterKeyReductionIcon.png" width=
    "32" height="32" alt=
    "MyImmerseCreateCharacterKeyReductionIcon (1K)"> 
    <!--  <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
</div>

<h4>6. Export the Character</h4>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/ScriptSelection.jpg" width="504" height=
    "391" alt="ScriptSelection (55K)">

    <p class="FigureCaption">Script Selection dialog box</p>
</div>

<p>When you export the character with Maya's Export All menu, you
will need to select a script that includes the Controller
Extractor export plug-in. The "Default Character Export" script
is a good one to use if you haven't created your own custom
script. Exporting creates three files: NIF, KF, and KFM. The NIF
file contains your character's geometry and textures, the KF file
contains the animation data, and the KFM file contains the
transition information from one sequence to another.</p>

<h4>7. Tweak Sequence Transitions in the Animation Tool</h4>

<p>The Gamebryo Animation Tool is designed to augment the art
pipeline by providing a feature-rich tool for organizing and
manipulating the animations of a game character.</p>
