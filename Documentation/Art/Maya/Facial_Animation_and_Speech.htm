<h1>Facial Animation and Speech</h1>


<p>Facial animation and speech are critical issues in today's 
 games and they're not easily accomplished. There are three different common 
 methodologies: morphing between face targets, detailed face skeleton, 
 and a combination of both. There are benefits and limitations to each, 
 so you will need to choose your method carefully. </p>

          <p class="FigureCaption">MorphingSkin.mb</p>
</div>

<p>The example we are using here is a combination of both. 
 The file MorphingSkin.mb contains:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Skinned face with gill bones for rhythmic breathing</li>
	
	<li>Morph Targets which show expression: Base Expression, 
 Smile, and Frown</li>
	
	<li>Morph Targets which show vocal positions Oooo, 
 Eeee, Aaaa</li>
	
	<li>Overall Character sequences Idle and Look Around</li>
	
	<li>Face Layer Sequences for Face Idle, Smile, Frown, 
 Ooo, Eee, Aaa, and Death Speech</li>
	
	<li>Layer Sequences for Breathing Easy and Breathing 
 Hard</li>
</ul>

<h4>Static Speech</h4>

<p>Static speech is the canned speech found in an in-game 
 cut scene. The dialog is set in advance and you want to have fine grained 
 control of the mouth positions and facial expressions so they match the 
 audio track. The "Death Speech" sequence is an example of this where the 
 artist blends the different morph targets by hand. This is saved in a 
 single sequence which can be used by the programmers.</p>

<h4>Dynamic Speech</h4>

<p>Dynamic speech would be seen as automated lip flapping. 
 Each mouth position is saved as an individual sequence. The programmers 
 determine at runtime what mouth positions are needed and use the Actor 
 Manager to automatically blend between the mouth positions. </p>

<h4>Layering Animations</h4>

<p>The sequence groups "Idle Breathing Easy" and "Idle 
 Breathing Hard" show layering animations. In these examples the character's 
 idle animation is played at the same time as his breathing animation; 
 this reduces the overall number of animations necessary. This is taken 
 even further with "Death Speech Idle Breathing Hard". As you can see blending 
 these sequences together can create a very dynamic character.</p>

<h4>Morphing and Skinning</h4>

<p>The face itself is both skinned and morphed. Both the 
 gill bones and face targets simultaneously deform the face mesh.</p>
