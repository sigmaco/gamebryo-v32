<h1>Morphing and Blend Shapes</h1>

<p>Morphing or "Blend Shapes" is one of the most powerful and
complex animation tools found in Maya. In general, morphing is
supported for export with the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in. Your blend
shape can have one or more morph targets to describe its
behavior, and the weights between those shapes can be animated.
It is possible to morph both regular objects and skinned objects.
Morphing in Maya does add a level of complexity, so there are a
number of pitfalls about which you need to know.</p>

<h4>Inconsistent Polygon Triangulation</h4>

<p>Unless you directly triangulate an object, Maya will
triangulate objects for export. Under normal circumstances,
differences in triangulation do not cause significant differences
in display. With morphing, however, the base shape and all the
targets MUST be triangulated in exactly the same way. When this
requirement isn't maintained, the model breaks apart during
morphing and ends up looking like spaghetti. The safest way to
setup morphing is to create, triangulate, and texture the base
shape. Then "Duplicate" the base and manipulate the vertices for
each of the morph targets.</p>

<h4>Multiple materials per object</h4>

<p>Unlike Maya, objects in Gamebryo only have one material.
During export, objects with multiple materials are broken into
separate objects based on material.</p>

<p>Before creating the target shapes, finish texturing the object
you want to morph. When you duplicate the object, each of the
targets will be broken up in exactly the same way, so the
morphing will look right. If the base and the target aren't
textured the same, they will triangulate in a different way and
you will get spaghetti.</p>

<h4>Things to Avoid:</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Do not remove vertices from the base or the targets</li>

    <li>Do not merge vertices from the base or the targets</li>

    <li>Do not flip any of the triangle edges for the base or the
    targets</li>

    <li>Do not change what materials are on this object</li>
</ul>

<h3>Making the targets invisible</h3>

<p>In most setups the targets are only used for morphing and
should not be rendered in the scene. The recommended way to make
the targets invisible is to set the export options for export
invisible as culled, and then make the targets hidden.</p>

<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">To create consistent and stable
morphing objects</p>

<ol>
    <li>Create Base Object</li>

    <li>Triangulate the Base Object.</li>

    <li>Verify edges were create the way you intended.</li>

    <li>Texture the object with one or more materials.</li>

    <li>Duplicate the base for each Target.</li>

    <li>Create the Blend Shape.</li>

    <li>Optional skin bones onto the Base Shape.</li>

    <li>Animate Morphing with the skin.</li>

    <li>Animate the bones.</li>

    <li>Set the export options for export invisible as
    culled.</li>

    <li>Hide the targets.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Morphing Normals and Vertices</h4>

<div class="FigureContainer">

    <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
</div>

<p>Morphing the normals as well as the vertices is more
expensive, but under some circumstances, it is important for
lighting. If you add the Boolean "Extra Attribute" to the
transform of the base object named "Ni_MorphUpdateNormals", you
will be able to specify if the morph also morphs the normals, and
not just the vertices. By default, morphing will only morph the
vertices, and not the normals.</p>

<h4>Instancing with Morphing</h4>

<p>Objects that are morphed are exported such that clones
(instances) are independently controlled and animated. However,
when the Mesh Instancing tool plug-in is used, morphed objects
that are instances or exact copies in the Maya scene will be
exported as hardware instances. As a result, there is only one
animated object and every other instance appears exactly the
same. Move morphed instances to another Max scene or use export
selected to prevent this behavior when using the Mesh Instancing
plug-in.</p>

<p>In the Morphing_Instanced_Grass.mb example there is a single
morphing clump of grass (GrassBase). "GrassBase" has been
instanced 100 times and placed around the scene. The Mesh
Instancing tool plug-in is used in the export script to enable
hardware instancing. As the scene animates, "GrassBase" is
animated once, but all of the instances get affected as well
because they are hardware instances (if supported).</p>
