<h1>Particle Attribute Window</h1>


<p>The Particle Attribute window can be found by selecting 
 the particle shape. If all the categories are fully expanded, it may be 
 necessary to collapse a few of the categories in order to view others.</p>

			<td>Animated Time Range</td>
			<td>The classic view of animation does not apply to particle 
 systems. Your animated vertex color and alpha are meant to describe 
 the life of a particle, not time with the scene. For this reason, 
 the length of your animation is not important. All animations start 
 at time zero and end with the last key you define. The best way to explain these settings is to use an example. If your animated particle vertex color ends of frame 100, then the lifetime of each particle is described by the animation curves from frame 0 to frame 100. The length of the color animation doesn't change the lifetime of a particle.</div>

speed will be from 60 to 120 degrees.</td>

a mesh particle system creates a particle it must create a "Clone".
These clones share geometry and texture information but there is still
an overhead associated with creating a clone. Mesh Particle systems may
contain pools of cloned objects to reuse instead of constantly deleting
and recreating each particle. A mesh particle system may still show
performance shudder as it starts up because the initial particles need
to be created. You would see this with things like explosions of mesh
particles where many particles are create at once and they are never
reused. To alleviate this problem check "Fill Pools On Load". When this
NIF is loaded, it will fill the pools with cloned objects. This will
slightly increase the load time of the particle system but it will
start playing quickly.</td>

			<td>Setting the Default Pool Size will specify how many 
 un-used particles to hold in the free particle pool for re-use. Constant 
 emission particle systems will need a smaller pool size while bursty particle 
 systems will need a larger pool. The default value -1 indicates the pools 
 size will be set to the maximum number of particles. </td>
