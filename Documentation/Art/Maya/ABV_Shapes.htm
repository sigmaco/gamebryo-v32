<h1>ABV Shapes</h1>

<p>ABV shapes include spheres, capsules, boxes, and half spaces.</p>

<h4>Spheres</h4>

<p>A Sphere ABV is generated using the center of the box 
 as its center, and the length of the longest box side as the diameter.&nbsp; 
 If you use a cube to model the ABV, as shown in the left picture, the 
 sphere will exactly fit the inside of the box.&nbsp; The picture on the 
 right shows the sphere in the application with a wireframe depiction of 
 the ABV surrounding it.&nbsp; All the wireframe objects in this sample 
 have been increased in size, so that they are not partially obscured by 
 the object's geometry.</p>

<h4>Capsules</h4>

<p>A Capsule ABV is generated using the center of the box 
 as its center, the longest box axis as the length of the cylinder, and 
 the length of the second longest axis as the diameter.&nbsp; If you model 
 the ABV using a box that has two equal sides, then the ABV will exactly 
 fit inside this box.&nbsp; If all three sides are equal, then you'll have 
 a Capsule that looks like a Sphere, but is not as efficient as a Sphere.</p>

<h4>Boxes</h4>

<p>Boxes are defined to be exactly the size of the proxy 
 box.&nbsp; When a box is defined to surround an actual box geometry, the 
 ABV may not be easy to distinguish from the parent (see picture to the 
 left).&nbsp; Since this sample slightly increases the size of the wireframe 
 ABV, it IS visible in the app (see picture to the right).</p>

    <p class="FigureCaption">Box example</p>
</div>

<h4>Half Spaces</h4>

<p>Half Spaces are defined as being co-planar with the 
 bottom of the proxy box and pointing in the direction of this face.&nbsp; 
 This box bottom is the face that is perpendicular to the shortest edge 
 of the box, and is the face at the local origin of the proxy box.&nbsp; 
 To model a half space, create a box that is very thin (looks like a plane), 
 and place it just on top of the surface to which it will be attached.&nbsp; 
 Any object intersecting or on the other side of this box will generate 
 a collision with the Half Space ABV generated for the parent.</p>
