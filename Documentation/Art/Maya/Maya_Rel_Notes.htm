<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.2</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Removed support for Maya 8.5</li>
    <li>Upgraded PhysX support to the Version 2.x PhysX plug-ins. Specifically, the
        NVIDIA_PhysX_Plug-in_Maya_x86_2.01.0529.1836.msi plug-in is supported. The 1.x plug-ins are
        no longer supported, though content generated with them is still functional.
        <ul>
        <li>The creation of static actors is now supported.</li>
        <li>The method of specifying collision geometry has been modified to make it simpler.</li>
        <li>A wider range of joint parameters is now supported.</li>
        <li>The PhysX plug-in is more robust and easier to use.</li>
        <li>Cloth support has been dropped pending PhysX APEX support in Gamebryo.</li>
        <li>Maya 2008 cannot be used with the PhysX plug-in.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Gamebryo PhysX export now provides an option to derive an optimal PhysX scene scale factor
    based on the scene working units. This option provides a scale factor that converts the working
    units to meters, taking into account the units that Gamebryo is using for scene graph export.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue that prevented exporting scenes that used used hardware instancing with
    custom shaders.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue that caused the NiMultiShader interface to disappear when working with a
    file that references a custom shader that no longer exists.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1.1</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in Maya smooth skinning export code for situations where the logical index into the bindPreMatrix does not match the physical index.</li>
<li>Advanced alpha blending mode now properly enables alpha blending.</li>
<li>Loading older Maya scenes that had alpha blending explicitly disabled now sets the alpha blend 
mode to None rather than Advanced.</li>
<li>Alpha testing and disabling alpha sorting can now be toggled in any alpha blending mode.</li>
<li>Made Maya export options save to transform node instead of unknown node in order to allow export of Maya ascii format.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented properly exporting string arrays in a custom attribute.</li>
    <li>The GamebryoMultiBatchExport utility script was updated to set the proper exporter settings
    and function in the case where the plug-in isn't auto-loaded.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added support for Maya 2010</li>

    <li>Improvements were made to the <a href="How_To__Apply_a_Shader.htm"><span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiMultiShader</span></a> attribute editor interface. These improvements were
    designed to solve usability problems. The new interface is more intuitive and provides a clear
    distinction between "Standard Material" and custom shaders. Plus the mechanism for rendering in
    the Maya viewport has been streamlined. Many minor bugs were addressed and an overall polish of
    the shader was complete. Please visit the <a href="How_To__Apply_a_Shader.htm"><span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiMultiShader</span></a> for more information.</li>

    <li>Support for other maps was made when using Maya's standard shader nodes. These include
    BaseMap, NormalMap, BumpMap, GlossMap, and GlowMap. Please visit the <a href=
    "Introduction_to_the_NiMultiShader.htm">introduction to Materials</a> for more
    information.</li>

    <li>Added a new feature to automatically generate the static bound for particle systems. This
    is now the default behavior. Please visit the <a href=
    "rpi_niparticlesystem_node_reference.htm">Particle System</a> node page for more
    information.</li>

    <li>Many improvements were made to the Maya exporter options. The significant one is now
    options are loaded when the scene is loaded. Prior versions would only load the options when
    you either exported or opened the option dialog.</li>

    <li>File export path is now stored as a relative path to the scene.</li>

    <li>Added a new feature to have the exporter completely ignore nodes under a "GamebryoIgnore"
    dag node in the scene graph. This is useful for having nodes that are needed for art creation
    but not really needed at time for export.</li>

    <li>Gamebryo now supports D3D11 within the Maya plug-in. It is now possible to export textures
    specifically for D3D11, and a D3D11 viewer can be launched within Maya.</li>

    <li>Added export option to control whether external original textures are copied to the export
    location.</li>

    <li>The ExportLog.xml file is now properly named and formatted when the silent export option is
    set.</li>

    <li>The Maya plug-in now identifies and reports more export errors rather than indicating
    success when failures occur.</li>

    <li>The Maya plug-in now exports the correct skin bind pose when multiple smooth skins are
    applied to the same joints.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Removed support for Maya 8.0</li>

    <li><a href="rpi_niparticlesystem_node_reference.htm#AlignmentParameters">Sprite Particle
    Alignment</a> (includes velocity aligned particles)</li>

    <li><a href="rpi_niparticlesystem_node_reference.htm#TextureAnimationParameters">Particle
    Texture Animation</a></li>

    <li><a href="rpi_niparticlesystem_node_reference.htm#ScaleParameters">Scale Particle Size based
    on Speed</a></li>

    <li><a href="rpi_niparticlesystem_node_reference.htm#AnimatedParameters">Animate Particle Size
    and Rotation over Particle Life</a></li>

    <li><a href="rpi_niparticlesystem_node_reference.htm#BaseParameters">Control of Sprite Particle
    Center (pivot point)</a></li>

    <li><a href="rpi_particle_shelf.htm#AddLivingSpawner">Living Spawner</a> (for creating particle
    trails)</li>

    <li><a href="rpi_niemitter_node_reference.htm#InitialParticleParameters">Positive or Negative
    Emission</a> (Speed Flip Ratio)</li>

    <li><a href="rpi_particle_shelf.htm#CurveEmitter">Emit Particles from a Curve</a></li>

    <li><a href="rpi_particle_shelf.htm#AddEmitter">Add Multiple Emitters to a Single Particle
    System</a></li>

    <li><a href="rpi_particle_shelf.htm#AttachEmitter">Attach Multiple Particle Systems to a Single
    Emitter</a></li>

    <li>Updated support for the PhysX Maya Plug-In to version 1.0.4 available from NVIDIA's
    website.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue where mesh particle systems were not being exported properly in batch
    mode.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue in MyImmerseRecursiveExport that was causing recursive exports to always
    fail.</li>

    <li>Fixed a random crash upon export with a scene containing a skinned mesh.</li>

    <li>Fixed particle system export issues related to using Linear Working Units preference in
    Maya</li>

    <li>Change in behavior with exporter options. Exporter options use to inherit from the
    previously loaded scene. Now they will use the options that are saved internally.</li>

    <li>Fixed issues with exporter options dealing with "Exported File Path" and "Prompt for File
    Path "</li>

    <li>Fixed several NiMultiShader attribute editor issues.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue with flipbook animations and shader maps not properly exporting.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.6.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added support for Maya 2009</li>

    <li>Support added for specifying Anisotropic Filtering as a filter mode in the texture export
    custom attributes. At runtime, the value specified for maximum number of samples will be
    clamped to the range supported by the hardware, and on platforms which do not support
    anisotropic filtering, trilinear filtering will be used instead. For more information, see the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderer.htm">NiRenderer</a></span> documentation and the
    documentation for each platform-specific renderer.</li>

    <li>Gamebryo now supports D3D10 within the Maya plug-in. It is now possible to export textures
    specifically for D3D10, and a D3D10 viewer can be launched within Maya</li>

    <li>Gamebryo now supports Wii within the Maya plug-in. It is now possible to export textures
    specifically for the Wii platform, and a Wii viewer can be launched within Maya</li>

    <li>Gamebryo now uses the concave/convex designation of a mesh to determine if it should be
    dynamic or static during fluid system export. Any mesh in a Maya scene that is marked as
    "nonconvex" will be exported as a PhysX <b>static</b> actor when the <a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX Extractor</a> is set to convert
    particles to fluids. The behavior is unchanged when "Convert PSys to Fluid" is unchecked in the
    <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX Extractor</a> options. You
    can use this feature to create static actors (although it won't work if you have particles in
    the scene that you don't want converted to fluids).</li>

    <li>Fixed a bug where subsequent quaternions in an animation sequence could have a negative dot
    product. This would cause "flipping" between keys where the quaternion would cause the
    controlled mesh to rotate the wrong way around between the two rotations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.5</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added a "Update Export Scripts" button to the export options window. Script Window no
    longer pops up by default.</li>

    <li>Removed the Export-Display option "<span class="NDLSystemFont">Use Old Particle Systems
    Fields (Not Recommended)</span>".</li>

    <li>Removed the Export-Display option to choose a different "<span class="NDLSystemFont">Script
    Template Directory</span>".</li>

    <li>Removed the "<span class="NDLSystemFont">Obsolete PS2 Options</span>" from Gamebryo's
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMultiShader</span>.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue with the Gamebryo portal creation tool where the created portal would be in the
    wrong location or having the normal facing the wrong direction.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue where Maya exports would include lights that were not found in the scene graph.
    This would generated output spews concerning unreferenced objects when loading the NIF. The
    Maya exporter no longer exports these default lights.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMultiShader</span> where, under some
    circumstances, an "<span class="NDLSystemFont">already has an incoming connection</span>"
    warning would be received while viewing with the "<span class="NDLSystemFont">Single Map
    Only</span>" option.</li>

    <li>Improved the exporter work flow dealing with export scripts and export options.</li>

    <li>The exporter now only turns alpha blending on when a texture has transparent alpha
    texels.</li>

    <li>Selecting an NBT method in the NiMultiShader's Mesh rollout now overrides the NBT method
    specified by an assigned Gamebryo Shader.</li>

    <li>Added support for extracting Maya NBTs.</li>

    <li>Cancellation has been enabled for the progress dialog during Gamebryo export. Users may now
    hit the escape key during export and processing will abort as soon as possible, returning
    control to Maya.</li>

    <li>The export option "Use Current Linear Working Units" is now set to false by default.
    Setting this to true will scale the effect of particle fields in unexpected ways.</li>

    <li>Converted to support <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh_Rel_Notes.htm">NiMesh</a>
    library.</li>

    <li>Added support for new <a href="../../Art/Other/Introduction_to_Mesh_Profiles.htm">Mesh
    Profile System</a>.</li>

    <li>Added Maya 2008 support.</li>

    <li>Made exports and previews always honor per-scene export settings.</li>

    <li>Added Multi-platform capability to command line batch export.</li>

    <li>Added mesh profile selection for Gamebryo transform node attributes and export
    options.</li>

    <li>Custom shaders may now be applied to particle system meshes.</li>

    <li>Instanced, morphed objects in Maya now result in independently controllable objects on
    export. See the discussion of <a href="Morphing_and_Blend_Shapes.htm">blend shapes and
    Gamebryo</a> for more details.</li>

    <li>Animated material attributes used to loop by default, now they use the looping settings of
    the animation curve to determine looping behavior.</li>

    <li>Animated material attributes used to loop by default, now they use the looping settings of
    the animation curve to determine looping behavior.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug that would prevent shaders from loading if a shader library failed to load.
    Shaders will now load even if a library fails.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug that would prevent shaders from loading if a shader library failed to load.
    Shaders will now load even if a library fails.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug where changes made to any NiMultiShader's alpha attribute using the attribute
    editor would effect every NiMultiShader node's alpha attribute in the scene.</li>

    <li>Removed deprecated "Fog map" option from the Dynamic Texture Effects node.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug where changing between different light types would cause the Gamebryo attributes
    to disappear.</li>

    <li>Added Sort Adjust attribute. For more information see <a href=
    "Create_Sort_Adjust_Node.htm">Sort Adjust Node</a>.</li>

    <li>Removed 8-bit palletized texture for platforms that do not support 8-bit.</li>

    <li>Fixed a bug where Maya creates a animation curves with invalid tangents. The invalid
    tangents made erratic animation. Now the tangents are made flat by default and a warning is
    written to the output window.</li>

    <li>Removed several meaningless error messages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.3.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Fully reviewed the documentation, clarified many topics and removed out-dated
    information.</li>

    <li>Changed the export behavior of cameras such that the 'Angle of View' parameter is now the
    horizontal angle of view (as it is in the Maya viewport and rendering) instead of the vertical
    angle of view. There is now a new export option to export with old behavior.</li>

    <li>Fixed memory leaks and improved export speed for instanced objects.</li>

    <li>Animated alpha values for shader input colors now get converted correctly.</li>

    <li>Layer roots, accumulation roots, and character roots can no longer be optimized out of the
    scene graph. This prevents some cases that would cause the Controller Extractor to fail.</li>

    <li>Added sample all translation and sample all rotation options. Changed default behavior from
    preserving native keyframes to sampling every frame.</li>

    <li>Added quaternion sampling support. Changed default behavior to sample rotations as
    quaternions by default. This prevents flipping due to unstable IK induced rotation values.</li>

    <li>Added support for "Silent" exporting. In silent mode, the exporter suppresses all dialogs.
    To support this behavior, the export path can be set in the export options.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug that prevented exporting in Maya batch mode.</li>

    <li>Altered display of Gamebryo attributes. Attributes are now organized in the Attribute
    editor under the Gamebryo tab and have more readable names.</li>

    <li>Reduced buttons on the Gamebryo shelf. Now all the buttons fit on one line. Many buttons
    moved to Gamebryo section of the Attribute Editor. Additionally, added buttons for exporting
    and viewing the export options.</li>

    <li>In prior releases the state of the attributes checkbox was ignored by some attributes. Now
    all attributes use the value of the checkbox to determine if the attribute should be used.</li>

    <li>Redesigned sequence editor. The new sequence editor combines the functionality of the Morph
    Tag, Text Key, and Sequence Editor dialogs. The new sequence editor clearly shows the
    hierarchically relationship between Character Roots, Layer Roots, Sequences, Morph Tags, and
    Text Keys.</li>

    <li>Exposed new shadow functionality in the attribute editor.</li>

    <li>Removed 4 bit paletted texture options.</li>

    <li>Removed superfluous map buttons in NiMultiShader interface. Other minor improvements to the
    NiMultishader interface.</li>

    <li>New examples. Removed many old examples, and changed example directory structure.</li>

    <li>Fixed a bug where shaders' ids were saved in files, as opposed to names.</li>

    <li>Fixed a bug where the last frame of an animation would not be exported for sampled
    attributes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.2.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed various memory leaks that would occur during the export process.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue where modified FX files could cause the Maya exporter to crash.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue where the Maya exporter would falsely identify TextureBlendMaterial as a shader
    that requires a skinned object.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue where un-checking Ni_BoneLODRoot attribute has no effect.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue where, in Maya, exporting a scene having an object consisting of a large number
    of vertices could lead to a crash.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue where exporter still allowed unsupported 4-bit palettes to be exported. Old
    assets with 4-bit palettes will now be exported as 8-bit palettes.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue where UV's for Maya's non-"File" textures were exporting incorrectly.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue where exporter could crash when exporting some skinned models.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue where exporter could crash if the process of collapsing vertices failed during
    optimizations.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue where exporter could crash if while exporting morph blendshapes, the exporter
    could not determine the undeformed base vertices.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue where exporter could crash if PolySoftEdge nodes were encountered.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue in the character sequence window where users could accidentally create zero
    length sequences.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue where the "Cancel" button of the exporter's script editor dialog would not
    operate correctly.</li>

    <li>Added support for editing more than one texture property at a time.</li>

    <li>Added support for PS3 on-target viewing.</li>

    <li>Added Maya 8.0 and Maya 8.5 support.</li>

    <li>Removed export options for simultaneously exporting and viewing as this led to certain
    inconsistencies in the export pipeline. Viewing can still be done via the Plug-in View Scene
    icon.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.2.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added support for Maya 7.0.1 and Maya 6.5.1</li>

    <li>Added <a href="Introduction_To_Gamebryo_PhysX_Maya_Support.htm">PhysX</a> support.</li>

    <li>Added <a href="Normal_Mapping_with_Maya.htm">Normal Map</a> and <a href=
    "Parallax_Mapping_with_Maya.htm">Parallax Map</a> to the NiMultiShader material</li>

    <li>Added <a href="Gamebryo_Lights.htm">Penumbra Angle</a> support for Spot Lights</li>

    <li>Added <a href="Dynamic_Texture_Effects.htm">Use Clipping Plane</a> Option to Project
    Texture Effects</li>

    <li>Added <a href="Export_Display_Options.htm#CustomViewer">custom viewer</a> support.</li>

    <li>Rewrote the UV export pipeline. In prior releases the UV sets were exported as they were
    encountered by the textures on an object. This behavior has been altered so that the UV sets
    are exported in the order that they were attached to the geometry. Textures will then find the
    correct UV set to attach to when they are exported. Note that only Repeat UV, Offset, and
    Rotate UV are supported in the place2DTexture options. Coverage, Translate Frame, and Rotate
    Frame would occasionally export in prior releases and this functionality has been removed. If
    you have any issues converting art assets for the new behavior, please contact support.</li>

    <li>Added support for direct-loading textures on supported platforms. This functionality is
    designed to increase loading performance, reduce the load-time memory footprint, improve
    general memory usage, and allow for platform-specific extensions. As a part of this effort, "DX
    9" and "Playstation 3" platform options were added to the Gamebryo export dialog (along with
    "Xbox 360"), and "PC" was renamed "Generic". See <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Programmer/Object_Systems/Streaming.htm#TextureStreamingOptions">Texture Streaming
    Options</a></span> for Internal Textures and the description of <span class="NDLSystemFont">
        <a href=
        "../../Reference/NiMain/NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData.htm">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</a></span>
        in the Main Class Reference for more details. As part of this effort:

        <ul>
            <li>Added support for Playstation 3, DirectX 9, and generic platform-specific export
            (in addition to Xbox 360 platform-specific export). See the Maya <a href=
            "Export_Display_Options.htm">export options</a> for more details.</li>

            <li>Added support for platform-specific default texture options for Playstation 3,
            DirectX 9, and generic platforms (in addition to Xbox 360). See the Maya
            platform-specific default <a href="Export_Texture_Options.htm">export texture
            options</a> for more details.</li>

            <li>Added support for platform texture properties for Playstation 3, DirectX 9, and
            generic platforms (in addition to Xbox 360). See the Maya <a href=
            "Create_Platform_Texture_Properties.htm">platform texture properties</a> for more
            details..</li>

            <li>Removed support for the Hurricane3D (handheld) platform.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Added <a href="Viewing_and_exporting.htm">Force Default Export</a> option in recursive
    export.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.1.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added support for Maya 7.0</li>

    <li>Added support for the new Gamebryo memory tracking system.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.0.2</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed bug 2674. Weighted tangents in animations can cause infinite loops.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug 2678. Animation curves without keys can cause infinite loops.</li>
</ul>

    Compression</a></li>

    <li>Added support for Maya Joint's "segment scale compensate"</li>

    <li>Removed icon for creating a custom Gamebryo cube map.</li>

    <li>Added support for Maya's Cubic Environment Map.Fixed Bug associated with animated rotation
    where only one axis is animated.</li>

    <li>Modified NiMultiShader to display shader descriptions in a scroll field so you can easily
    read the description.</li>

    <li>Added intelligent switching of viewers. If you have the Gamebryo Animation Tool as you

<ul>
    <li>Selecting the Shade Group as the current texture in the UV Texture Editor when using the 
    NiMultiShader may cause Maya to crash.</li>

    <li>Changing a material to use the standard material from a custom shader, and then 
    re-assigning the original custom shader may cause the NiMultiShader to fail to generate the
    custom shader's parameter UI. If this happens, select a different custom shader, then return
    to the original to re-generate the UI.</li>

    <li>Export of Bone / Skin LOD requires the SceneGraphOptimization plug-in.</li>

    <li>Maya cannot open any scenes containing an NiMultiShader in batch mode. For this reason, it
    is recommended to launch Maya in GUI mode even when doing automated batch processing.</li>

    <li>Maya may crash when pressing a button on the Particle Shelf without having the Gamebryo
    Maya Plug-in loaded. To avoid this problem preload the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in in the standard
    Maya plug-in manager.</li>

    <li>Maya 2009 may crash at shutdown on quad core PCs using the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in. This
    problem is annoying, but non-destructive since the scene is already saved or discarded by the
    time the crash occurs.</li>

    <li>MultiNif exporting may not work properly unless a FileName is explicitly specified for each
    part to be exported in the MultiNif Export dialog. This is true even if the global or local
    settings specify to use the object name as the name of the NIF.</li>

    <li>The first time the plugin is loaded custom viewer scripts are generated for each viewer
    plugin, such as the Xbox 360 and PS3 viewer plugin. However, these viewer scripts are not
    available for use until the second time the plugin is loaded.</li>
    
    <li>When the Gamebryo plug-in is loaded on demand, in response to a file load, an extra
    export parameters node will be created that takes precendence over the parameters specified
    in the loaded file. Always explicitly load, or auto-load, the Gamebryo plug-in before loading
    a file that needs it.</li>

    <li>Export NonVisible Objects (as culled) option does not do anything. Non-visible objects are
    aways exported as culled.</li>

    <li>Parsing mesh profiles can take a significant amount of time. The more files needed to parse
    will increase the time it takes Maya to load the plug-in. The time is directly proportional to
    the number of profiles. The number of profiles should be monitored and kept to a minimum.</li>

    <li>With certain hierarchies the exporter fails to sample animation properly. To work around
    this issue, turn off sampling and bake the animation inside Maya.</li>

    <li>If the exporter has to create generated nodes, for instance in the case of a transform with
    a non-identity pivot, if there is a character root attribute, it will not be placed on the
    correct generated node. This will cause the controller extractor to potentially miss animation
    on the character root. This might also apply to other attributes, besides the character root
    attribute.</li>

    <li>The Maya compression dialog has issues when setting values and occasionally does not
    reflect the values that are actually exported.</li>

    <li>Upon manual deletion of one of the maps from the NiMultiShader, the last known component
    values will persist. This may cause the NiMultiShader to shade incorrectly. For example, if
    when manually deleting the "DarkMap" from the NiMultiShader, the components could be left in an
    all dark state (0, 0, 0). In this situation, the object may render black inside maya. The work
    around for this side effect is to use Maya's "Attribute Spread Sheet" and set the DarkMap's
    R,G,B values back to the default of (1,1,1).</li>

    <li>JPEG files are not converted when used as environment maps. A native format must be
    used.</li>

    <li>Flipbook textures will not be compressed by the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in even if compression
    is specified. If compressed textures are needed, manually compress the textures.</li>

    <li>A dialog may be displayed that says "The procedure entry point cgIsParameterUsed could not
    be located in the dynamic link library cg.dll.", because Maya's older version of Cg is being
    used instead of NVIDIA's. The solution is to edit the system path environment variable to
    remove Maya's bin directory. This directory contains an older version of Cg that should not be
    used with Gamebryo.</li>

    <li>Particles will export to Gamebryo as double the size of their viewport sprite
    representations.</li>

    <li>Procedural textures may export with the wrong repeat value for their UVs.</li>

    <li>Coverage, Translate Frame, and Rotate Frame of place2dtexture would occasionally export in
    prior releases and this functionality has been removed. If you have any issues converting art
    assets for the new behavior, please contact support.</li>

    <li>Per texture size reduction fails for HDR images when exported for Xenon. Either scale down
    HDR images with global exporter settings, or modify the source images.</li>

    <li>The accumulation root for a character should not be used as a bone for skinning any
    vertices. This is because some of the transformations on that bone will be propagated to a
    NonAccum node, and the skinning will no longer look correct. This will be addressed in the
    future, but in the meantime do not use the accumulation root for skinning.</li>

    <li>NiEulerRotKeys have limitations in how they are used for rotation accumulation. If any axis
    is specified for rotation accumulation, then all axes will be accumulated.</li>

    <li>If a controller has keys that are looped in the source art package and the sequence time
    range does not include those keys, a single clamped value will be computed from the keys and
    used for that sequence, eliminating the looping behavior. A workaround for this is to manually
    loop the animation keyframes within the sequence time range. This problem also affects IFL
    files that are used with sequences. In the case of an IFL file, a workaround is to manually
    loop the listed frames in the IFL file itself so that the animation loops throughout the entire
    time range.</li>

    <li>Textures other than TGA, BMP, SGI, RGB, RGBA, INT, INTA, DDS are occasionally smeared. This
    is a known Maya texture export issue.</li>

    <li>The right-click menu for animation controls in the Attribute Editor does not work with
    NiMultiShader's Material Alpha parameter.</li>

    <li>Use of non-uniform scale on bones must be avoided. Gamebryo only supports a uniform scale
    as a trade-off of flexibility for performance. Unlike the general case, it is not possible to
    propagate non-uniform scaling information directly to the vertices.</li>

    <li>Only the XYZ rotation order is supported, if Euler rotations are used.</li>

    <li>Unsigned Integer shader values are stored as signed integer values in Maya. This is a
    limitation of Maya.</li>

    <li>Shaders that are provided as FX files will not have their pixel and vertex shader versions
    correctly reported. They will always display shader version 0.0.</li>

    <li>Tangents weights are not supported, and different tangent values for position keys are not
    supported. If your animation utilizes either one of these qualities, the animation will need to
    be sampled. Animations are sampled by default.</li>

    <li>Sometimes the export progress window will remain up even though the export has finished.
    When this happens just close the window.</li>

    <li>Scriptjobs are not run in batch mode. This is a limitation of Maya, however, certain
    Gamebryo scripts are run using Scriptjobs that update the Maya scenes. These will not run in
    batch mode. To work around the issue, open older scenes in Interactive mode and then re-save
    them. This is probably not an issue for most scenes, but will affect scenes with 4 bit texture
    options.</li>

    <li>The light Attribute Editor can get in a state where it will not view Gamebryo Attributes.
    If two different types of lights get Gamebryo Attributes added to them, only the last type of
    light will be able to display the attributes. The work around requires that the user call the
    MEL command "resetAE."</li>

    <li>When using the Texture Set controls in the NiMultiShader interface if the uv sets are
    specified before the textures are added to the shader the values are ignored.</li>

    <li>Maya 2008 produces non-unitized surface normals on some computers (for example, 0, 0,
    0.99999994). During export, the Gamebryo plug-in will attempt to re-normalize. Due to precision
    errors, this will still result in non-unitized normals (e.g. 0, 0, 1.001959).</li>

    <li>When exporting blend shapes for the PS3, keep the number of targets for the blend below
    20.</li>

    <li>The default particle system colliders created by the Gamebryo toolbar in Maya will be set
    to tell particles to spawn on collision but not die on collision, but the spawner applied to
    those particle systems is not set to spawn any particles. This will have the same overall
    effect as not spawning at all, but it may introduce some additional unnecessary work.</li>

    <li>The Xbox 360 does not support 24-bit images. To avoid runtime image conversion and possible
    memory fragmentation, 24-bit images will be converted to 32 bits during Xbox 360-specific
    export.</li>

    <li>The Playstation3 does not support 24-bit images. To avoid runtime image conversion and
    possible memory fragmentation, 24-bit images will be converted to 32 bits during
    Playstation3-specific export.</li>

    <li>The Maya plug-in may not correctly convert rigid skins when multiple meshes have been
    applied to the same joint.</li>
</ul>

<a name="PhysX" id="PhysX"></a><h3>PhysX</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The Maya PhysX plug-in is available for Maya 2009 and Maya 2010. See
    <a href="../../Programmer/NiPhysX/NVIDIA_PhysX_Resources.htm">NVIDIA PhysX&trade; Resources</a>
    for additional information about PhysX.</li>

    <li>
        <b>Cannot create joints to fixed world locations</b>&mdash;Any rigid constraint (joint)
        must be connected to two rigid bodies when authored in Maya. However, PhysX requires joints
        to static locations to be specified with no actor and a pure world location.

        <p class="indent1"><em>Workaround:</em> Create the joint to a static actor in the scene.
        Typically, you should make the static actor the second rigid body for the joint. Check
        the "Same Position" option. Upon export, the joint will replace the static
        actor with the pure world location and behave as expected. This joint will not be created
        when you simulate in Maya due to bugs in the PhysX Maya plug-in.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Instancing of PhysX not Supported</b>&mdash;The PhysX Maya plug-in does not support
        instancing of PhysX content.

        <p class="indent1"><em>Workaround:</em> Instance first, add PhysX properties after.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Duplication of PhysX content fails</b>&mdash;The PhysX Maya plug-in crashes when you
        try to duplicate PhysX nodes.

        <p class="indent1"><em>Workaround:</em> Don't try to copy or duplicate. Make copies of the
        original geometry and then add PhysX properties. For very large scenes it may be worth
        scripting the process.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Rigid Bodies lose Lighting</b>&mdash;When an object is converted to a rigid body the
        light links are lost.

        <p class="indent1"><em>Workaround:</em> Re-link the lights explicitly.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Scale on Accumulation Root not Supported</b>&mdash;Scaling transformations of any kind
        on the "Accumulation Root" of a character will cause physics control of the character to
        fail.

        <p class="indent1"><em>Workaround:</em> Create an intermediate node as a child of the
        Accumulation Root and scale it instead of the root.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Maya Gravity is Ignored</b>&mdash;The Gamebryo export process always uses the gravity
        vector given in the <a href=
        "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm"><span class="NDLSystemFont">PhysX
        Extractor</span></a> tool plug-in options.

        <p class="indent1"><em>Workaround:</em> Make certain that the <span class=
        "NDLSystemFont">PhysX Extractor</span> gravity vector matches the gravity you are using
        internally for Maya.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Fluid Emitters Cannot be Attached to Triangle Mesh Shapes</b>&mdash;A fluid emitter
        cannot be attached to an actor that has a triangle mesh shape.

        <p class="indent1"><em>Workaround:</em>Use an alternate collision shape for the actor.</p>
    </li>
