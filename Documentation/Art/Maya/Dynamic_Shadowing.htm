<h1>Dynamic Shadowing with Maya</h1>

<p>The Gamebryo Maya Plug-in can export lights that cast 
 shadows across a scene, which can have a striking visual effect. However, 
 shadow casting lights are very expensive so some additional considerations 
 must be made when creating a scene that contains shadows.</p>

<p>Once a light has been marked as shadowing, it will render 
 all of the objects it affects that are marked as casters to a shadow map 
 each frame, which can be used to determine what parts of the scene are 
 in the caster's shadow. This means that each object that is a caster must 
 be rendered an additional time which has an impact on performance.</p>

<p>To mark a light as shadowing, turn on &quot;Use Depth 
 Map Shadows&quot; in the lights Attribute Editor. The text box &quot;Resolution&quot; 
 controls the size of the shadow map for Gamebryo, just as it does in a 
 rendered Maya scene.</p>

<p>Objects that are marked as shadow receivers must make 
 use of the shadow map in their material calculations, which adds to the 
 rendering cost of the material.</p>

<p>Due to the performance overhead of each caster and receiver, 
 it is a good idea to try to minimize the number of casters and receivers 
 in a given scene. Consider carefully which objects might not need to cast 
 shadows such as terrain or a skydome as well as which objects do not need 
 to receive shadows because they are never going to be obscured from the 
 light source.</p>

<p>To mark an object as either a non-caster, non-receiver, 
 or both, bring up the Attribute Editor dialog for that object. There are 
 'Receive Shadows' and 'Casts Shadows' flags in the Rendering Stats section.</p>

<p>Additional considerations need to be made depending 
 on the type of light casting the shadows. Spot lights have the least amount 
 of considerations because the shadow map always corresponds to the cone 
 of the spotlight. Directional lights must fit the shadow map to encompass 
 all casters at once, which means that if the shadow casters are too far 
 apart, the shadows cast by each will be low resolution and could give 
 poor results. Omni lights must render six shadow maps each frame to form 
 a cubemap image. This is not only expensive on the object rendering side, 
 it also means that each omni light requires a significant amount of texture 
 memory. Shadow casting omni lights should be used as sparingly as possible.</p>

<p>When setting up a shadow casting light, you have the 
 option of choosing between any shadowing technique
 that is available in  Gamebryo. Different shadowing techniques can have very 
 different performance considerations so it is important to understand them 
 before choosing a shadowing technique.</p>

<p>Take for example &quot;<span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiPCFShadowTechnique</span>&quot;. In this technique, 
 the material of the shadow receivers must make multiple reads into the 
 shadow map. This means that the expense of using this technique increases 
 as the pixel coverage of the shadow receiver does. In the case of <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiVSMShadowTechnique</span>, 
 the rendered shadow map has a gaussian blur performed, which means that 
 as the shadow map increases in resolution, the cost of the shadow increases.</p>
