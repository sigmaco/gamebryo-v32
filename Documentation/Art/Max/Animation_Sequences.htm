<h1>Gamebryo Animation Sequences</h1>

<p>The sections in this topic discuss how animation sequences can
be set up and exported from 3ds max in such a way that they can
be used in the <a href=
"../../Tools/animation_tool/Introduction_to_Animation_Tool.htm">Gamebryo
Animation Tool</a>. To take advantage of all of Gamebryo
Animation Tool's options, you'll need to specify your sequences
explicitly either with the <a href=
"Animation_Manager_Reference_and_Description.htm">Animation
Manager</a> dialog or by using Note Tracks. If you use the
Animation Manager, Note Tracks will be automatically created for
you that contain the proper information. The instructions in this
section only apply if you are creating the Note Tracks
manually.</p>

<h2>Sequence Specification Basics</h2>

<p>For each character in your scene, you need to create a Note
Track in the Track View in 3ds max on the root node of that
character. In the export process, the Controller Extractor
plug-in examines the keys on each Note Track it finds to
determine information about the sequences for the character
corresponding to that Note Track. Whenever a Note Track is
encountered in the export process, the animation keys for every
object underneath the node corresponding to that Note Track are
separated out into KF files and are then removed from the NIF
file that gets saved out. You can specify additional Note Tracks
lower in the character hierarchy than the root, such as on an arm
or leg. This will cause additional KF files to be exported for
just that sub-hierarchy. All sequence names in a particular MAX
file must be unique. You can specify multiple sequences in any
particular Note Track.</p>

<h4>The "start" key</h4>

<p>At the start frame of the sequence you want to use, create a
key in the Note Track with the text "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">start</span>" (all lowercase).</p>

<h4>The "end" key</h4>

<p>At the end frame of the sequence you want to use, create a
note with the text "<span class="NDLSystemFont">end</span>" (all
lowercase).</p>

<h2>Sequence Options</h2>

<p>The "<span class="NDLSystemFont">start</span>" key may have
any of the following tags behind it, depending on what results
you want:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">-name mysequencename</span></p>

<p>Use this option to name your sequence Please see <a href=
"#Notes">Notes</a>.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">-loop</span></p>

<p>Use this option to force your sequence to use the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LOOP</span> cycle type. Please see <a href=
"#Notes">Notes</a>.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">-at [all | none |
{xyz}]</span></p>

<p>Accumulate translations: all, none, or any combination of x,
y, and z [default = accumulate none of the translations]. Please
see <a href="#Notes">Notes</a>.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">-ar [all | none | x | y | z
]</span></p>

<p>Accumulate rotations along: all axes, no axis, or one &minus;
either the x, y, or z axis [default = accumulate none of the
rotations]. Please see <a href="#Notes">Notes</a>.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">-smooth</span></p>

<p>Make accumulated rotations smooth. Accumulated rotation keys
on Note Track nodes except the first and last are pushed down to
its children. Please see <a href="#Notes">Notes</a>.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">-front [x | negx | y |
negy]</span></p>

<p>For use with accumulated rotations where the character is
facing a direction other than the positive x axis.</p><a name=
"Notes" id="Notes"></a>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Make sure that the name you pick for the animation
    sequence name has no spaces in it.</li>

    <li>The -loop option is useful for Biped animations because
    Character Studio won't allow you to set the Out of Range Type
    to Loop for Bipeds.</li>

    <li>The accumulation options (-at and -ar) only work on
    top-level sequences. This means that if a child in the scene
    graph also has sequences specified, only the sequence
    accumulation flags on the topmost parent of the object with
    sequences are used. Accumulations mean that the previous
    animation axis positions will be added to the looping
    animation axis positions, creating a realistic continuous
    movement instead of restarting at the beginning when it
    reaches the end of the loop. If you are planning on computing
    your own custom accumulation, make sure to set both of these
    options to "none".</li>

    <li>The -smooth option does not work with multiple sequences.
    It only works properly if your sequence range is the same as
    the range for the whole animation.</li>

    <li>You must specify at least one sequence in order to export
    using the Controller Extractor plug-in. If you try to extract
    animations from a scene that has no Note Track or no "start"
    or "end" keys in a Note Track, the Controller Extractor
    plug-in will pop up a message and fail to execute
    correctly.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples:</h2>

<p>Suppose you have a biped Walk loop animation that lasted for
31 frames, from frame 0 to frame 30. Suppose your character is
walking along the x-axis. To specify the sequence, create a Note
Track in the Max Track View on the Bip01 node.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Create a new note key at frame 0, and enter the text,
    "<span class="NDLSystemFont">start -name WalkForward -loop
    -at x -ar none</span>"</li>

    <li>Create a second note key at frame 30, and enter the text,
    "end"</li>
</ol>

<p>Now suppose you have a loop animation of the same character
walking and turning right, that lasted 28 frames, from frame 0 to
frame 27. To specify the sequence for Gamebryo Animation Tool,
create a Note Track in the Max Track View on the Bip01 node.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Create a new note key at frame 0, and enter the text,
    "<span class="NDLSystemFont">start name WalkTurnRight loop at
    xy ar z</span>"</li>

    <li>Create a second note key at frame 27, and enter the text,
    "<span class="NDLSystemFont">end</span>"</li>
</ol>
