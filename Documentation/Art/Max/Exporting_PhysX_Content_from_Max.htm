<h1>Exporting PhysX Content from Max</h1>

<p>When a scene is exported using Gamebryo's exporter, 
 PhysX content associated with a Gamebryo node is added as extra data. 
 For example, any object tagged as a dynamic rigid body by the Max PhysX 
 plug-in has extra data in its Gamebryo node stating what type of actor 
 it is, what its PhysX properties are and what its collision shape is.</p>

<p>To convert this extra data into PhysX objects, such 
 as actors, joints and fluids, the scene graph must be processed by the 
 <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX 
 Extractor</a> <a href="Scripting_the_Art_Pipeline_in_3ds_Max.htm">tool 
 plug-in</a>. The result can then be saved using any of the single-NIF 
 output plug-ins (not multi-NIF plug-ins).</p>

<p>The <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX 
 Extractor</a> tool plug-in creates a PhysX prop and a Gamebryo interface 
 for that prop. Properties such as hardware support for the prop can be 
 set via the options dialog for the tool plug-in. The options also control 
 the conversion of particle systems into <a href="PhysX_Based_Particle_Systems_and_Max.htm">PhysX-based 
 particle systems</a> or <a href="PhysX_Fluids_and_Max.htm">fluids</a>.</p>

<h2>Coordinate Systems</h2>

<p>The PhysX prop that is created by the <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX 
 Extractor</a> is in the same coordinate system as the scene root of the 
 exported Gamebryo scene graph. At run-time, when the prop is introduced 
 into Gamebryo, the transformation of the PhysX prop will be set to match 
 the global transformation of the scene graph in the application. The <a 
 href="../../Programmer/Introduction_to_GamebryoPhysX_Programming.htm">PhysX 
 Programmer's Guide</a> has details.</p>

<p>By default, Max's System Units are used to determine what scale the simulation within the scene 
uses. It is recommended that each scene use a consistent system unit. Your system 
units setting will be used in place of the PhysX Extractor's Scale Factor option to automatically 
convert the simulation units into meters.</p>

<h2>Additional Tool Plug-ins</h2>

<p>There are three other Tool Plug-ins associated with 
 PhysX content:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>The <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Cleaner.htm">PhysX 
 Cleaner</a> tool plug-in removes from nodes the extra data encoding PhysX 
 content. Use it if your Max scene contains PhysX-enabled objects that 
 you do not want exported using Gamebryo's exporter. This plug-in is not 
 required if the <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX 
 Extractor</a> is in use because the latter removes the extra data as it 
 processes it.</li>
	
	<li>The <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Ragdoll.htm">PhysX 
 Rag-doll</a> tool plug-in is used to associate a set of rigid bodies defining 
 a rag-doll with a set of bones for the character the rag-doll will control. Within 3ds Max
 this will most likely be unnecessary as ragdoll setup is supported directly.</li>
	
	<li>The <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Nif_Viewer.htm">PhysX 
 Viewer</a> tool plug-in launches the <a href="../../Tools/PhysX_NIF_Viewer/Introduction_to_the_PhysX_NIF_Viewer.htm">PhysX 
 NIF Viewer</a> application for Win32 which is the tool provided for previewing 
 Gamebryo-PhysX content. Select the &quot;Default PhysX Viewer Script&quot; 
 as the Custom Viewer in the <a href="Viewer_Selection_Panel.htm">Viewer 
 Selection Panel</a> to launch this viewer. To launch the PhysX Nif Viewer 
 on consoles, use the console-specific on-target viewer options.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<h4>Platform Specific Export</h4>

<p>PhysX targets the same platform for mesh cooking as 
 the renderer is targeting.</p>

<h4>Extra Data</h4>

<p>Internally, the export of PhysX content from Max happens 
 in two phases. The first phase, inside the Gamebryo Max plug-in, processes 
 the Max scene to identify content for export. During this processing, 
 PhysX objects, modifiers and User Props are found and associated
 with their Gamebryo node counterparts. These Gamebryo nodes are tagged with Extra 
 Data that encodes everything about the PhysX properties of the node. We 
 use Extra Data because the plug-in must compile and execute without the 
 source for the PhysX Max plug-in and Gamebryo's PhysX-specific classes that depend
 on the PhysX SDK. This process happens 
 regardless of whether you wish to export the PhysX content: if PhysX content 
 is present in the Max scene, it always appears as Extra Data in Gamebryo 
 nodes.</p>

<p>As the scene graph is processed by the export scripts, 
 the PhysX Extractor tool plug-in looks for the Extra Data in the nodes 
 and converts it to the NiPhysX objects ready for streaming to NIF. As 
 it does this, it removes the Extra Data from the nodes so there will be 
 no PhysX-related Extra Data remaining after the PhysX Extractor has run.</p>

<p>If the PhysX Extractor tool plug-in is not used, the 
 Extra Data remains in the nodes during streaming. However, the PhysX Cleaner 
 tool plug-in can be used to remove the Extra Data with no other effects 
 on the scene graph.</p>
