<h1>Gamebryo 3ds Max Export Options</h1>

<p>You can export your 3D Studio Max scene for use with Gamebryo by selecting
Gamebryo (*.KF,*.NIF) in the File -&gt;Export dialog. Once you select a
filename, you will be presented with the following options dialog.</p>

<p>Your export settings are stored with the Max file when you save it. These
options are saved as Extra Data on the root node of the Max scene-graph. This
approach helps to ensure that future exports will use the correct settings. The
Max file is not automatically saved in the process of export, so it will be
necessary to save the Max file in order to fully preserve the export
options.</p>

<h2>Export Options Sub-panel</h2>

<p><b>Cameras</b>: Check this box if you want to export the cameras in the
scene.</p>

<p><b>Lights</b>:Check this box if you want to export the lights in the
scene.</p>

<table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
    <tr align="left">
        <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD">
            <p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>

            <div class="NDLNote">
                If you have not explicitly created any lights in your scene,
                3ds Max automatically creates two (directional) lights and an
                ambient light. Gamebryo exports the Max Ambient light as
                specified under Rendering &gt; Environment &gt; Global Lighting
                options. (If you do not want an extra ambient light in your
                scene, make your ambient color 0,0,0 and no ambient light will
                be exported. If the Lights checkbox is unchecked, none of these
                lights will be exported.)

<h2>Textures Options Sub-panel</h2>

<p><b>Textures</b>:Textures can be exported inside the main NIF, separate NIFs,
and in their original form. If you choose to use the original textures, you can
choose whether to copy them to the export location. Please see the <a href=
"./Exporting_Textures.htm">documentation on Exporting Textures</a> to weigh the
pluses and minuses of each approach.</p>

<h2>Animation Options Sub-panel</h2>

<p><b>Use App Time</b>:If this box is checked, animations are set to use the
APP_TIME animation type. If this box is unchecked, they will use APP_INIT. You
will want to leave this box checked (the default) unless a programmer requests
that you export with APP_INIT. APP_INIT animations must be started
explicitly.</p>

<p><b>Use existing Biped keyframes instead of sampled keyframes</b>: Character
Studio uses TCB keys for Biped animation, but unfortunately it doesn't allow
exporting any of the TCB parameters. Because of this fact, the Gamebryo 3ds Max
Plug-in exports the keyframes as Bezier keys. If this box is checked, the
Gamebryo 3ds Max Plug-in will export Bezier keys only at times for which there
are Biped animation keys in Character Studio. If this box is unchecked, the
Gamebryo 3ds Max Plug-in will sample the Biped animation at a rate of one key
per frame per bone. Redundant keyframes are removed, but this process can
generate a large number of keyframes. In general, you should check this option,
because it is more efficient, unless you notice poor animation conversion
quality, in which case you should uncheck this option. Usually, Footstep
animation looks incorrect if you check this option, but Freeform animation
looks fine.</p>

<p><b>Skin Weight Threshold %</b>: Bone weights contributing less than this
percentage to the skin per vertex are dropped. This technique is useful in the
cases where skinning partitions are less than optimal; in such cases, this
technique can substantially improve performance. The tradeoff is, of course,
accuracy of the final skin. In most cases weights of less than 5% are
completely unnoticeable contributions to the final animation.</p>

<a name="ExportSelected" id="ExportSelected"></a><h2>Export Selected</h2>

<p>It is possible to export only the selected objects in the scene for rapid
prototyping. Note that objects with external references in the hierarchy such
as skinned characters, particle systems, lookat nodes, etc. will not export
their dependency targets if those objects are not selected. For instance,
exporting out a skinned character with no bones selected will result in a
character in bind pose with no animations.</p>
