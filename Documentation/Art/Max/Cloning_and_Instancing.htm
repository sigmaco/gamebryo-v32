<h1>Cloning and Instancing with 3ds Max</h1>

<p>Instanced objects in Max are shared in Gamebryo as well. This
technique can be extremely useful on memory-starved consoles.
Note: If you adjust the pivot or non-uniform scale of an
instance, it will become unique. Uniform scale is supported, but
non-uniform scale cannot work with instances in Gamebryo because
non-uniform scale is baked into the geometry. It should also be
noted that instanced objects in Gamebryo must share the same
material, unlike in Max. Instanced objects that need different
materials should be made unique.</p>

<h2>Non-Uniform &amp; Uniform Scale</h2>

<p>Gamebryo does not support animating non-uniform scales (i.e.
scales with different values in the x, y, and z axes). Animating
non-uniform scale is not supported and will be treated like a
uniform scale when animating. All static non-uniform scales are
baked into the geometry data itself.</p>

<p>If you need to have something non-uniformly scaled or
squashed, use a morph target to achieve the action. Morph targets
can be created by squashing an object in 3ds max and using
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Tools / Snapshot</span> to grab a
desired morph target.</p>
