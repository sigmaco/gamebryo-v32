            standardized a set of export options for a particular project. With
            this feature, everyone on the team can use the same export
            routines.</td>

            This option causes the messages from all export errors and
            warnings, as well as any information presented in the ToolPlugins'
            information dialogs, to be written in an XML file located at
            <span class=
            "NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;MaxInstallPath&gt;</em>\plugins\MaxImmerse\GamebryoOutputLog.xml</span>.
            This is useful for batch export scripts because it prevents files
            that display modal dialogs from interrupting the batch export
            process. This file collects information from all of the exports
            done in a single Max session and writes the file when Max is
            closed. On a new run of Max, this file is overwritten.</td>

            <td>Specify which class of keyframes to use.<br>
            <br>
            You can leave this box as it is by default (unchecked) unless you
            are having problems with Biped keys. Character Studio uses TCB keys
            for Biped animation, but unfortunately it doesn't allow exporting
            any of the TCB parameters. Because of this fact, the Gamebryo 3ds
            Max Plug-in exports the keyframes as Bezier keys. If this box is
            checked, the Gamebryo 3ds max Plug-in will export Bezier keys only
            at times for which there are Biped animation keys in Character
            Studio.<br>
            <br>
            If this box is unchecked, the Gamebryo 3ds Max Plug-in will sample
            the Biped animation at a rate of one key per frame per bone.
            Redundant keyframes are removed, but this process can generate a
            large number of keyframes. In general, you should use this option,
            because it is more efficient, unless you notice poor animation
            conversion quality, in which case you should uncheck this option.
            Usually, Footstep animation looks incorrect if you check this
            option, but freeform animation looks fine.</td>

            <br>
            Double-sided materials now use a stencil buffer property to disable
            backface culling. Previous to NetImmerse 4.2 (and Gamebryo), the
            geometry was doubled for the objects to which this material was
            assigned. The only side effect is that lighting will only occur on
            the forward facing side of the object, i.e. the side with
            normals.<br>
            <br>
            As of NetImmerse 4.2 (and Gamebryo), keyframe extraction sequences
            can be specified for more than one object at a time. Please review
            the Sequence Extraction documentation for more information and to
            find out about the greater flexibility this technique gives the
            artist.<br>
            <br>
            This option will enable the old behavior for both of these
            changes.</td>
