<h1>DirectX Shader in the Max Plug-in for Programmers</h1>

<p>The DirectX Shader is one of the material types available in the Max
material editor. This material can be used to preview an FX shader in the Max
viewport as you work and is supported by the Gamebryo Max Plug-in.</p>

<a name="Intro" id="Intro"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>By using the DirectX Shader material in 3ds Max, you get get viewport
preview of a selected FX shader including live update of shader parameters.
This can greatly improve the iteration time for developing shader-driven assets
because you don't have to wait for an export to preview each parameter change.
Since the same shader code is being executed in 3ds Max and in Gamebryo, the
viewport preview is reasonably accurate.</p>

<p>In order for the chosen shader to work, it must be supported by both
Gamebryo and 3ds Max simultaneously. Information on how to make a shader
conform to this is described in this document.</p>

<p>Before attempting to make a shader that is compatible with 3ds Max and
Gamebryo, it is recommended that you are familiar with the FX syntax as well as
how to integrate FX files with Gamebryo. More information on the FX file syntax
can be found in the DirectX SDK and information on integrating FX files with
Gamebryo can be found at <a href=
"../../Programmer/NiShader/Integrating_D3D_Effect_Files.htm">Integrating D3D FX
Files</a></p>

<p>For information on how to use the DirectX Shader in Max, see the <a href=
"DirectX_Shader_in_Max.htm">DirectX Shader in Max</a>
documentation.</p>

<a name="Restrictions" id="Restrictions"></a><h2>Restrictions and requirements</h2>

<p>The DirectX Shader interface in Max does not have the option of changing
some settings that would be available in the Gamebryo Shader. When using an
effect, keep the following restrictions in mind:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You cannot use a Reflect/Refract map to create a cubemap. If you need
    to assign a cubemap, you must construct the cubemap as a single DDS file
    using the DirectX Texture Tool (see DirectX SDK for documentation)</li>

    <li>There is no interface for setting texture transforms</li>

    <li>There is no interface for setting up flipbook textures</li>

    <li>You cannot use texture export custom attributes</li>

    <li>The diffuse, specular, and ambient material colors don't support an
    alpha component</li>

    <li>Skinning shaders are not supported by 3ds Max</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to use this feature and have it export correctly into Gamebryo, you
must conform to many restrictions. The most important thing to remember is that
the shader you want to use must be supported by both 3ds Max's DirectX Shader
Material (which has nothing to do with the Gamebryo Max Plug-in) and the
Gamebryo runtime.</p>

<p>Being supported by the 3ds Max DirectX Shader Material means that it must be
an FX file that meets certain semantic and annotation requirements discussed
later in this document. Restrictions on the 3ds Max DirectX Shader Material
also prevent skinning shaders from being used because 3ds Max does not support
the necessary semantics.</p>

<p>Being supported by the Gamebryo Runtime means that the shader file must
exist in your Gamebryo media directory and must contain additional semantics
and annotations discussed later in this document.</p>

<a name="KeyDifferences" id="KeyDifferences"></a><h2>Key differences between 3ds Max and Gamebryo</h2>

<p>Both 3ds Max and the Gamebryo runtime parse semantics and annotations from
FX files to determine how to interpret specific parameters. However, 3ds Max
supports some semantics and annotations that are not supported by Gamebryo and
vice versa. In order to create a shader that works in both places, you must be
constrained to only the semantics and annotations that are supported by
both.</p>

<p>One of the primary differences is an annotation that 3ds Max uses to
identify an attribute as visible to the artist. All visible attributes are
required to have the string annotation <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UIName</span>. An attribute that is specified without this
annotation may give a binding warning in 3ds Max.</p>

<p>In order to set the min and max value of a numeric attribute for the artist
UI, you must use the annotations <span class="NDLSystemFont">UIMin</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">UIMax</span>.</p>

<p>Gamebryo supports a technique annotation called <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UsesNiRenderState</span> which means to set the render states
defined by that mesh's material properties which is a convenient way of
ensuring reliable renders. However, this annotation is not supported by 3ds Max
so it is likely that some render states will be inconsistent unless explicitly
set by the shader. Because of this, you may need to have the shader explicitly
set common render states to ensure a consistent preview. Specifically, setting
the alpha blending, ZMode, and culling states can make a significant
difference.</p>

<p>3ds Max does not support the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SKINBONEMATRIX3</span> semantic, so skinning shaders cannot
work in both Gamebryo and 3ds Max.</p>

<p>Gamebryo does not support scripts or rendered textures in custom shaders so
if you have a shader that depends on this functionality, you will need to
refactor it.</p>

<p>There are additional differences in the supported semantics for lights and
vertex colors. These topics are discussed below.</p>

<a name="UsingTextures" id="UsingTextures"></a><h2>Using Textures</h2>

<p>Although texture inputs are specified the same way between 3ds Max and
Gamebryo, additional steps need to be taken in order to get the exported UV
data lined up with the assigned map channels.</p>

<p>For each texture that you want a shader to use, you must indicate what UV
coordinate set and Map Channel it should read its UV data from. This
association is provided by annotations on the texture attribute that associate
each UV set with a map channel.</p>

<p>To link a map channel with a UV set, create two integer annotations on the
texture; <span class="NDLSystemFont">Texcoord</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MapChannel</span>. When both of these annotations are provided,
3ds Max will generate a UI spinner allowing you to select what Map Channel you
want the texture to read from. The value assigned to the MapChannel annotation
is ignored.</p>

<p>Instead of associating these annotations with a specific texture, it is
possible to specify the mapping using a dummy int attribute instead. When
specified this way, the attribute must have the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Texcoord</span> semantic. When this is done, the value of the
attribute is ignored, and only the annotations are considered. This method is
required to associate vertex colors with UV coordinate data as described later
in this document.</p>

<table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
    <tr align="left">
        <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD">
            <p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>

            <div class="NDLNote">
                UV set indices start at 0 and count up, but Map Channels start
                at 1 and count up. Using a Map Channel of 0 will refer to 3ds
                Max's vertex color data As described in the vertex color
                section of this document.
            </div>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>A set of semantics can be provided to determine what <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTexturingProperty</span> Map slot a texture attribute will
get stored in in the resulting scenegraph. The following semantics are
supported:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Semantic</th>

            <th>NiTexturingProperty Map slot</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>DiffuseMap</td>

            <td>Base</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>BumpMap</td>

            <td>Bump</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>NormalMap</td>

            <td>Normal</td>
        </tr>

            <td>LightMap</td>

            <td>Dark</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Although the semantic takes the highest priority when determining what map
slot to use, if it is absent you can use the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UIName</span> annotation to associate the texture with a
particular <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTexturingProperty</span> map slot.
This will replace the need to provide a string <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NTM</span> annotation. The following are acceptable values:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Value in UIName annotation</th>

            <th>NiTexturingProperty Map slot</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>

  <table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
      <tr align="left">

              <div class="NDLNote">
                * for decal and shader maps, you may append an integer to the
                string value in order to specify what index in the array of
                maps to use. For example, "decal0", "decal1", and "shader0" are
                valid values for <span class="NDLSystemFont">UIName</span>.
              </div>
          </td>
      </tr>
  </table>

<p>In addition to specifying <span class="NDLSystemFont">UIName</span>, you may
still specify the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NTMIndex</span> as a separate
annotation if it doesn't conflict with an index suffix on the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UIName</span>.</p>

<p>If the <span class="NDLSystemFont">UIName</span> that is provided does not
match a texture map slot name, the texture will be assigned to the first
available shader map slot.</p>

<p>Code sample:</p>
<pre>
texture NormalTex : NormalMap
&lt;
    string UIName = "Normal Map";
    int Texcoord = 0;
    int MapChannel = 1;
&gt;;
</pre>

<p>For cubemap textures, provide the additional annotation <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">string Type = "cube"</span></p>

<a name="UsingLights" id="UsingLights"></a><h2>Using Lights</h2>

<p>In order to get light parameters into shader constants, several attributes
must be associated with the same light. Support having an interface for
selecting a single light that sets the value of several attributes, you must
link each attribute associated with a single light object together using
annotations.</p>

<p>For the attribute that stores the position of a light, add an integer
annotation called <span class="NDLSystemFont">RefID</span>. The value that you
assign to this annotation will be used to link other attributes to the same
light.</p>

<p>For other light attributes, add the integer annotation <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LightRef</span> and give it a matching value.</p>

<p>You must provide a semantic for all light attributes. The following
semantics are supported:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">POSITION</span></li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">DIRECTION</span></li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">LIGHTCOLOR</span></li>
</ul>

<p>One additional required string annotation is <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Object</span>. The only values that are supported by both 3ds
Max and Gamebryo are <span class="NDLSystemFont">PointLight</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">DirectionalLight</span>.</p>

<p>Code Sample:</p>

<pre>
float4 LightPosition1 : POSITION
&lt;
    string UIName = "Light 1";
    string Object = "PointLight";
    string Space = "Model";
    int refID = 0;
&gt;;

float4 LightColor1 : LIGHTCOLOR
&lt;
    string Object = "PointLight";
    int LightRef = 0;
&gt; = {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f};
</pre>

<a name="UsingVertexColors" id="UsingVertexColors"></a><h2>Using Vertex Colors</h2>

<p>3ds Max does not support the <span class="NDLSystemFont">COLOR</span>
semantic as Gamebryo does so in order to use vertex colors with your shader,
you must reference vertex colors using different semantics. You do this by
using the preprocessor conditions.</p>

<p>You can make portions of your code only visible to the 3ds Max FX parser
usin the statement <span class="NDLSystemFont">#ifdef _3DSMAX_</span>. In order
to map Max's vertex colors to UV coordinate set 1 and use it in a vertex input
struct, follow the example of this code:</p>

<pre>
#ifdef _3DSMAX_
int texcoord1 : Texcoord
&lt;
    int Texcoord = 1;
    int MapChannel = 0;
&gt;;
#endif

// ...

struct VS_IN
{
    float4 pos : POSITION0;
    float3 norm : NORMAL;
    float2 tex0 : TEXCOORD0;
#ifdef _3DSMAX_
    float3 vcol : TEXCOORD1;
#else
    float3 vcol : COLOR;
#endif
};
</pre>

<p>When starting with a shader that works in Gamebryo that you want to work in
the Max viewport, make sure your shader conforms to the following
restrictions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Make sure all visible attributes have the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">UIName</span> annotation</li>

    <li>Replace any <span class="NDLSystemFont">NTM</span> annotations with an
    appropriately named value in <span class="NDLSystemFont">UIName</span></li>

    <li>Replace any uses of string annotation <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">description</span> with <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">UIHelp</span></li>

    <li>Replace any uses of numeric annotations <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">min</span> or <span class="NDLSystemFont">max</span> with
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">UIMin</span> and <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">UIMax</span> respectively</li>

    <li>If using more than one map channel, add MapChannel and Texcoord
    annotations as described above</li>

    <li>Modify the semantics used for world, view, or projection matrices to
    use the semantics that are supported by both 3ds Max and Gamebryo as
    described below</li>

    <li>For light attributes, replace the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ObjectIndex</span> annotation with <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">RefID</span> for position and <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">LightRef</span> for any other attributes</li>

    <li>For cubemap textures specify the annotation <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">string Type = "cube"</span></li>

    <li>If using the vertex color semantic, convert to reading vertex colors
    from Texture coordinates when in Max as described above</li>
