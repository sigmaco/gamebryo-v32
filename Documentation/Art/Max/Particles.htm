<h2>Gamebryo Export Params</h2>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/PSysExport.jpg" width="173" height="718"
    alt="PSysExport (57K)"> 
    <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
</div>

<p>In order to properly export out particle systems, Gamebryo
adds a rollout of custom attributes at the bottom of the particle
system parameters.</p>

<h4>Simulation Options:</h4>

<p><b>Loop</b>: This option allows the user to specify whether
this is a one-shot particle emission set or loops.</p>

<p><b>Reset On Loop</b>: This option determines whether the
particle system clears itself of all particles upon loop</p>

<p><b>System Start</b>: This is the frame the particle system
starts its simulation.</p>

<p><b>System End</b>: This is the frame the particle system ends
its simulation.</p>

<p><b>Honor Viewport Counts</b>: This option determines whether
the "Basic Parameters/Percentage of Particles" spinner will
affect the final number of particles. This is useful if you want
to have the particle system look exactly like it does in the max
viewport.</p>

<p><b>Use Local Space PSystem</b>: - This option determines
whether or not the particles move relative to their parent node.
This parent node is defined by the "PSystem Parent Node" UI item
below.</p>

<p><b>PSystem Parent Node</b>: - This option allows the user to
select where the particle system will be placed in the exported
scene graph. The default is to place the particle system at the
root of the scene. The <b>R</b> button next to this pick button
will reset the selected root to be the default scene root.</p>

<p><b>Maximum Active Particles</b>: This is the maximum number of
particles that this system will be required to display on the
screen at one time. This determines the amount of memory
allocated for this system when exported and will affect the size
of the final .nif file. The value needs to include any particles
spawned during the lifetime of the system.</p>

<p><b>Re-estimate Maximum</b>: This button attempts to calculate
a rough best guess of the number of particles this system can
support. It may need to be tweaked if the particle system doesn't
seem to emit properly. If rate is being animated, this value will
change according to what the current rate is in the time
slider.</p>

<h4>Particle Rotation Options:</h4>

<p><b>Speed</b>: This option allows the user to adjust the speed
of rotation. The units for this variable are in degrees per
second.</p>

<p><b>Variation</b>: This option allows the user to adjust the
randomness of rotation speed. The units for this variable are in
degrees per second.</p>

<p><b>Bi-Directional Rotation</b> This option allows the user to
specify whether or not the particles are allowed to rotate both
clockwise and counter-clockwise or only clockwise.</p>

<h4>Bounding Volume Options:</h4>

<p><b>Bounds Update Type</b>: This option allows the user to
specify whether the bounding volume of this particle system is
static (pre-computed) or dynamically updated as the particle
system is simulating. Note that static bounding volumes should be
considered local to the particle system object, even if the
system is set to use world-space particles.</p>

<p><b>Update Every X Frames</b>: This option determines how often
the bounds are recomputed when the bounds are dynamic.</p>

<p><b>Static Bound Position/Radius</b>: This option allows the
user to set the bounding volume position and radius in local
space for the static bounding volume.</p>

<p><b>Use Current Frame Bounds</b>: This option takes a snapshot
of the current frame's bounding volume in Max and uses it to
compute the position and radius.</p><a name=
"gamebryo_extra_params" id="gamebryo_extra_params"></a>

<h2>Gamebryo Extra Params</h2>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/extraparticleparams.gif" width="167" height=
    "464" alt="extraparticleparams (5K)"> 
    <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
</div>

<p>Note that the Gamebryo Extra Params only apply to sprite (not
mesh) particles.</p>

<h4>Alignment</h4>

<p><b>Normal Align</b>: Use this to determine what axis each
particle's normal vector will face. By selecting 'Fixed', you can
specify an axis in the particle system's local space.</p>

<p><b>Up Align</b>: Use this to determine what axis each
particle's upward vector will face.</p>

<h4>Scale</h4>

<p><b>Scale Factor</b>: This value controls the rate at which the
particle stretches in the U or V directions as a particle's speed
increases. A value of 0.0 indicates not to change the particle
size in that direction.</p>

<p><b>Scale Rest</b>: The U or V multiplier when the particle has
a speed of zero.</p>

<p><b>Scale Limit</b>: The maximum U or V multiplier that will be
applied to a particle. This limit the maximum scale that will be
applied as speed approaches infinity.</p>

<p>When velocity scaling is active, the scale multiplier is
determined by the following equation:</p>

<p>Scale = (Factor x Velocity x Limit + Rest) / (Factor x
Velocity + 1)</p>

<h4>UV Animation</h4>

<p>In order for UV animation to work properly, create a particle
texture that is divided into evenly spaced cells that go all of
the way to the edge of the texture.</p>

<p><b>Frames Across/Down</b>: Describe how many cells the source
texture is divided into.</p>

<p><b>Initial Frame</b>: What frame to start the animation
on.</p>

<p><b>Initial Frame Variance</b>: The range of frames from the
initial frame that each new particle will start on. The starting
frame is evenly distributed over the range <b>[Initial Frame +/-
Initial Frame Variance]</b>.</p>

<p><b>Frames/Life</b>: The total number of frames of animation
the particle will cycle through over the course of its
lifespan.</p>

<p><b>FPL Variance</b>: The range of frames from the Frames/Life
parameter to use for the final frame count over lifespan. The
total number of frames over a particles life is evenly
distributed over the range <b>[Frames/Life +/-
Variance]</b>.</p><a name="space_warps" id="space_warps"></a>

<h2>Space Warps</h2>

<p>Gamebryo supports many of the forces and space warps available
in Max. The complete list of supported space warps is as
follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Gravity</li>

    <li>Wind</li>

    <li>SDeflector</li>

    <li>Deflector</li>

    <li>PBomb</li>

    <li>Drag</li>
</ul>

<p>Please see the charts below for a full <a href=
"#Particle_System_Charts">supported feature analysis</a>. All
objects can have their transforms manipulated, however, do not
use scale when animating transforms. This can have an
unpredictable effect.</p><a name="materials" id="materials"></a>

<h2>Particle Systems &amp; Materials</h2>

<p>Particle Systems require special care when using materials. In
order to use Particle Age materials and Particle Opacity you will
need to turn on Vertex Colors in the Gamebryo Shader.</p>

<p>Since particles are aligned quads, the default Gamebryo Shader
material configuration is probably not appropriate for rendering.
This is because it doesn't make sense to use diffuse lighting
with particles since their normals change depending on camera
position.</p>

<p>In order to make particles independent of scene lighting, the
following material settings are recommended:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Diffuse Color: Black</li>

    <li>Emissive Color: White</li>

    <li>Vertex Colors: On</li>

    <li>Src Mode: EMISSIVE</li>

    <li>Light Mode: E</li>
</ul>

<h2>Particle System &amp; Space Warps Supported Features In
Depth</h2>

<p>The following chart shows supported parameters for each
particle system and notes about achieving visual fidelity with
Max and Gamebryo particle systems. Most particle system exports
assume a frame rate of 30.</p><a name="Particle_System_Charts"
