<h1>Tutorial: Using the Animation Manager - Simple Animation Sequences</h1>

<h2>Series: <a href="Max_Plug_in_Introduction.htm">Max Introduction</a></h2>

<h2>Audience: Artists new to Gamebryo</h2>

<p>The Gamebryo Animation Manager is a powerful tool in helping artists
generate animation sequences for their games. When using this tool you need to
load or create an actor with some animation.</p>

<p>1. Once you have a suitable subject, bring up the Animation manager by
clicking the icon on the <a href=
"Gamebryo_MaxScript_Toolbar_Introduction.htm">Gamebryo Toolbar</a>, or going to
the Utility Panel, selecting MAXScript and running the 'Animation Manager'
script.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/image002_08.jpg" width="175" height="218" alt=
    "Animation Manager - Actor rollout (7K)" />
    <p class="FigureCaption">Animation Manager - Actor rollout</p>
</div>

<p>2. At the very top of the Animation Manager is the Actor rollout. Select the
Add button and then select the Root node of your actor. The root node is the
top of your characters bone hierarchy. Usually the hip or the Bip01 on
Character Studio setups. The Actor section is made to manage more then one
character in a scene. Unless you have a horse and rider situation you will
likely only touch this panel once. The Accumulation root should be the same as
the actor root. This is the default unless you desire a different setup.</p>

<p>3. Skip down to the Active Sequence rollout. You will see "Empty_Sequence_At
#f" is the default name of your first sequence and its range has set itself
from your current max time slider. If you have a valid animation sequence like
a walk cycle or idle cycle, go ahead and enter the start and end frames
manually or by going to the start frame and hitting the 'Start Now' button,
then the end frame and hitting the 'End Now' button. For example 1 and 20. 
Rename the sequence 'Walk', 'Idle' or appropriate name.</p>

<p>4. Add a second Sequence. Go to your next sequence by hitting the 'Append
New Sequence' button. This adds a new sequence after your first. Adjust the end
of the 2<sup>nd</sup> sequence by hitting the 'End Now' button on the last
frame of the second sequence's animation.</p>

<p>5. Navigate the Sequences. Go back to the first sequence by hitting the
'Previous' Button. You will see the Sequence Name change to your first entry.
Hit the 'Make Time Range Fit' button and Max will automatically adjust the
current time sliders to fit your first sequence. Hit play to preview. Click on
the Next button and the sequence name will change to your second sequence.
Again, hit the 'Make Time Range Fit' button to adjust your viewport time.</p>

<p>6. Now it is time to export your animation sequences. Choose File&gt;Export.
In the Gamebryo 3ds max Plug-in Export Options dialog box, you can select which
export script you wish to run. (Make sure that the Controller Extractor is
included in the export script. Several scripts are included that will extract
animations to a single KF file or multiple KF files, either saving out a NIF or
not saving one out. ). In this case, we will select the script named
<em>"Multiple KF Export With NIF"</em>. This script will save out the NIF file
and each animation sequence will be created in its own KF file. Additionally, a
KFM file will be created if one has not already been created.</p>

<p>7. You can preview and adjust animation sequences by loading up the KFs or
KFM in the <a href=
