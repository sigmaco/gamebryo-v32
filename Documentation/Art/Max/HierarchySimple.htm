<h1>Simple ABV Hierarchy in 3ds Max</h1>

<p>Now we'll look at how to structure the hierarchy in 3ds Max in more
detail.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/SphereGraph.jpg" width="372" height="241" alt=
    "Sample Hierarchy for Simple ABV Setup (22K)">

    <p class="FigureCaption">Sample Hierarchy for Simple ABV Setup</p>
</div>

<p>Above is an example of what our schematic view of a hierarchy might look
like for creating an <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a> out of 3ds
Max. Of course, in the above case, we have a sphere mesh, so this is about as
perfect case for using <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s as you
can get!</p>

<p>In order for the proxy <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s to affect
the proper nodes, you need to attach the proxies as children of the nodes for
whom you want them to define <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s. In this
way, not only does the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a> generator
know who to attach the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a> to, but
the proxies will also inherit any transformations you may give to the parents,
so the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a> proxies
will remain in the proper position in relation to the parents while the model
is being manipulated.</p>

<p>When working with a character, for instance, you may want to define the
<a href="../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
while the character is in figure mode so that the boxes are axis-aligned for
the most part while you are defining them. The 3ds max schematic view of a
Sphere <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a> proxy type
is shown above, as an example. The first child of the root node is the actual
geometry for that node, and the second child is the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>
description, each of which has a single Box child and a basic name for <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>
generation.</p>

<p>The location and orientation of the axes of the proxy are unimportant. One
may want to align them with those of the object the box is attached to for
clarity's sake, if desired, but the box will maintain its orientation to the
parent no matter what these values are.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/SphereRender.jpg" width="342" height="242" alt=
    "Sample Rendering (Box is the Sphere-Proxy) (17K)">

    <p class="FigureCaption">Sample Rendering (Box is the Sphere-Proxy)</p>
</div>

<p>Above, we see the 3ds Max perspective rendering. Note that we have modified
the properties of our box to make it "See-Through". This is helpful, especially
when having whole hierarchies of proxies as is the case with characters.</p>
