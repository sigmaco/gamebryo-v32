<h1>ShadowSettings.max</h1>

<p>The ShadowSettings.max sample demonstrates the effect of having a dynamic
shadow casting light in a scene. It also demonstrates when you should make use
of the shadow casting and receiving flags.</p>

<p>To make a light cast dynamic shadows, check the "Shadows on" checkbox in the
light's General Parameters. With this setting selected, all of the objects that
the light affects (using its include/exclude list) will, by default, cast and
receive shadows. To override the default and make an individual object
<em>not</em> cast or receive shadows, you can change the cast and receive
shadows flags in the properties dialog for that object.</p>

<p>With dynamic sghadows, there are some performance and quality issues to take
into consideration.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Each object that a light uses to cast shadows must be rendered to the
    shadow map. This can lower performance. Additionally, using large shadow
    casters will cause the shadow map to have a lower quality solution because
    the shadow map must be stretched to encompass the entire object.</li>

    <li>Performance can also be lowered because each object that receives
    shadows must perform the shadow map calculations in its material.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the performance implications, you want to optimize your scene by
chosing as few casters and receivers as possible. This example scene
demonstrates some of those optimizations. The ground in the example does not
need to cast a shadow because there is nothing below it, so it is marked as a
non-caster. The stone pedestal receives very little shadowing, so it is marked
as a non-receiver to improve performance. The sundial must be both a caster and
a receiver to get self shadowing.</p>
