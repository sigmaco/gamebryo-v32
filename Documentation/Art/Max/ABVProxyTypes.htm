<h1>ABV Proxy Types</h1>

<h2>Spheres</h2>

<p>A sphere ABV is generated using the center of the proxy as its center, and the length 
 of the longest side of the proxy as the diameter.&nbsp;If you use a cube 
 to model the proxy, as shown in the left picture, the sphere bounding 
 volume will exactly fit the inside of the proxy.&nbsp;The picture on the 
 right shows the sphere object in an application with a wireframe depiction 
 of the sphere ABV 
 surrounding it.&nbsp;All the wireframes in this sample have been increased 
 in size, so that they are not partially obscured by the object's geometry.</p>

<h2>Capsules</h2>

<p>A capsule ABV is generated using the center of the proxy as its center, the longest proxy axis as the length of the capsule, and the length of the second longest axis of the proxy as the diameter. If you model the proxy using a box that has two equal sides, then the capsule ABV 
 will exactly fit inside of this box.&nbsp; If all three sides are equal, 
 then you'll have a capsule ABV 
 that looks like a sphere ABV, 
 but is not as efficient as a sphere ABV.</p>

<h2>Boxes</h2>

<p>Boxes are defined to be exactly the size of the proxy.&nbsp; 
 When a proxy is defined to surround actual box geometry, the <a href="../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a> 
 may not be easy to distinguish from the parent in 3ds max (see picture 
 to the left).&nbsp; Since this sample slightly increases the size of the 
 wireframe ABV, 
 it is visible in the app (see picture to the right).</p>

<h2>Half Spaces</h2>

<p>Half Spaces are defined as being co-planar with the 
 bottom of the proxy box and pointing in the direction of this face.&nbsp; 
 This box bottom is the face that is perpendicular to the shortest edge 
 of the box, and is the face at the local origin of the proxy box.&nbsp; 
 To model, create a box that is very thin (looks like a plane), and place 
 it just on top of the surface to which it will be attached.&nbsp; Any 
 object intersecting or on the other side of this box will generate a collision 
 with the Half Space ABV 
 generated for the parent.</p>
