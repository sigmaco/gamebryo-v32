<h1>Billboards with 3ds Max</h1>

<h2>About Billboards</h2>

<p>Billboards are a special type of object which the Gamebryo
engine automatically transforms to face the camera. In many
cases, good use of billboards can significantly optimize a scene
by representing complex objects as simple quadrilaterals with
textures that look like the object. Billboards can also simulate
some effects that are otherwise difficult to achieve, such as
volumetric lighting. There are several methods the engine can use
to rotate the object, each of which is useful in different
situations. These methods are described below.</p>

<h2>Creating a billboard object in 3ds Max</h2>

<p>To make a billboard object in Max, take the following
steps:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Bring up the <a href=
    "Billboard_Utilities_Panel.htm">Billboard Helper
    Utility</a>.</li>

    <li>Select a type of billboard from the panel.</li>

    <li>Select an object from the Max scene that you would like
    to represent as a billboard.</li>

    <li>Press the "Apply to Selection" button on the panel. This
    adds a string to the object's user-defined properties that
    tells the exporter to set the appropriate engine flags.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that Max does not support billboards
as Gamebryo does, so when you apply this property, the object
will not look or behave any differently in Max. To see the
effects of the billboard property, launch the <a href=
"Gamebryo_3ds_max_Plug_in_Utility_Panel.htm">preview
tool</a>.</p>

<h2>Axis alignment for billboards in 3ds Max</h2>

<p>When an object is flagged as a billboard, Gamebryo knows to
automatically align the object to face the camera. However,
Gamebryo does not automatically know which side of the object the
artist wants to face the camera, as well as which part of the of
the object should be facing up. To simplify setting these values,
the exporter assumes that the object's positive Y axis always
faces up, and the object's local positive Z axis should be used
to determine the billboard's orientation with respect to the
camera.</p>

<p>Due to these assumptions, some adjustment may be needed for
your billboards to look as expected in the engine. This can be
solved easily by taking the following steps:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Select the billboard object</li>

    <li>Click on the Hierarchy tab of the Max Command Panel</li>

    <li>Under the "Adjust Pivot" rollout, click the "Affect Pivot
    Only" button.</li>

    <li>You can now rotate the pivot as you would any Max object,
    but your rotations will not affect the object to which the
    pivot belongs.</li>

    <li>Rotate the pivot until its positive Y axis is pointing in
    the "up" direction relative to the object, and the positive Z
    axis is pointing in the direction you want the camera to
    always "see" when viewing the object.</li>

    <li>Uncheck the "Affect Pivot Only" button.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of billboards</h2>

<p>Max supports five types of billboards. Each behaves
differently as detailed below.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Standard</b>&mdash;A Standard billboard's "forward"
    direction (local positive Z axis) will always face towards
    the camera. The billboard's "up" direction (local positive Y
    axis) will point in the direction closest to the world's up
    direction as it can while staying in the camera's view
    plane</li>

    <li><b>Up</b>&mdash;An Up billboard will always keep its "up"
    direction (the local positive Y axis) parallel to the world's
    up direction. It rotates about its up direction as needed to
    always have its "forward" direction (the local positive Z
    axis) face the camera. This is useful for objects like a tree
    in the distance because the tree will always display its full
    width, but when you go above the tree and look down, it won't
    appear that the tree is laying on the ground.</li>

    <li><b>Rigid</b>&mdash;A Rigid billboard always keeps its up
    direction parallel to the up direction of the camera, and it
    always keeps its forward direction parallel to the camera
    direction. This means that the object will act like a screen
    texture that gets larger and smaller based on its distance to
    the camera. This type of billboard could be used for a
    lighting effect such as a lens flare or a circular glow
    texture to represent volumetric lighting.</li>

    <li><b>Center</b>&mdash;A Center billboard is similar to a
    Standard billboard, but the Center billboard faces in the
    direction of the difference between the camera's location and
    the billboard's location. The advantage is that the billboard
    still faces the camera when the billboard is not centered on
    the screen.</li>

    <li><b>Rigid Center</b>&mdash;The Rigid Center billboard is
    an improved version of Rigid. It keeps its up direction
    parallel to the up direction of the camera, and it rotates as
    necessary to keep its forward direction parallel to the
    difference between the billboard location and the camera's
    location.</li>
</ul>
