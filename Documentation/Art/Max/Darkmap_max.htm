<h1>Darkmap.max</h1>

<p>This 3ds Max sample includes light maps that use <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">wallmap2.bmp</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">floormap2.bmp</span> to create the illusion of lighting. This
effect is probably the simplest multitexture effect.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">darkmap.max</span> sample demonstrates how to set up the Gamebryo Shader to achieve this
effect. It consists of five multitextured polygons that form a simple room
(Wall01 through Wall04 and Floor). The Walls and Floor material both have a
highly-repeated surface texture in the Base texture slot and a dark map in the
Dark slot. Each of the five planes has a second UV channel that is used by the
dark map. The base map uses the first UV channel. This arrangement allows the
base texture to be highly repeated while the light map is only repeated once
across each polygon.</p>

<p>The four walls have been left separate to allow inspection of the "UVW
Mapping" Modifiers. The light maps themselves were generated by turning on the
four hidden spot lights and rendering orthographic views of the floor and one
of the walls. These images were then adjusted in Photoshop (brightened and
blurred) then re-incorporated into the scene as dark maps. Note that both the
Walls and Floor material have their "Apply Mode" set to REPLACE. Changing this
setting to MODULATE (in both shaders) and unhiding Omni01 and "Light Marker"
demonstrates the interaction of dark maps and dynamic lights. Omni01 is
attached to a circular path and lights each wall in turn. Note that dark maps
are so named because they can only darken the original image. A value of pure
white in the dark map will leave the value of the base texture untouched. Any
dimmer value will only darken the base texture.</p>
