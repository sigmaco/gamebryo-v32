<h1>PhysX-Based Particle Systems with Max</h1>

<p>Gamebryo-PhysX supports <a href=
"../../Programmer/NiPhysX/Introduction_to_NiPhysXParticle.htm">PhysX-based
particle systems</a> in which the particles are modeled as PhysX
actors with their motion controlled by standard Gamebryo particle
modifiers. There are two principle advantages to PhysX-based
particles:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Particles use PhysX collision detection and resolution,
    which means they can collide with any kind of PhysX-enabled
    geometry.</li>

    <li>The particle actors have mass and other physical
    properties, so they can push dynamic objects around or be
    pushed around by kinematic or dynamic objects.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two basic steps in creating a PhysX-based particle
system: create a prototypical particle actor, and convert the
particle system on export.</p>

<h2>Creating Particle Actors</h2>

<p>The prototypical particle actor for particles is a rigid-body
located anywhere in the scene (but unlinked to anything else)
that has <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXParticleActor =
PSystemName</span> in the User Props where <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PSystemName</span> is the name of a particle
system for which this is the actor.</p>

<p>There must be one actor for each particle system in the scene.
You can choose not to specify an actor, but then one must be
provided at run-time before the particle system can be used
(which must be done by programming). The actor can have any
properties at all, but it must be a single actor, not a jointed
pair or other combination. The shape for the actor can be any
shape and will determine how the particle collides with and
interacts with other objects. For the simplest effects, a small
sphere of the particle's rendered size is best, but other shapes
are possible, including groups of shapes.</p>

<p>At run-time, the particle is not scaled by the rendered size.
It remains a fixed size. The rendered particle appearance is
completely controlled by PSystem modifiers, independent of the
actor's shapes.</p>

<h3>Mesh Particle Actors</h3>

<p>Mesh particle systems require at least one PhysX actor for the
first particle generation. Subsequent generations can have their
own actor or will fall back to the most recent generation's
actor. To specify a mesh particle actor, you must append ":X"
after the particle system name to indicate the actor. For
example, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXParticleActor =
MeshPSys:0</span> specifies the actor for generation 0 of the
particle system named MeshPSys.</p>

<p>At run-time, the particle shape or motion is not affected by
any animations on the mesh object. The rendered particle
appearance is completely controlled by PSystem modifiers,
independent of the actors' shapes.</p>

<h2>Exporting PhysX-based Particles</h2>

<p>Use the <a href=
"../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PhysX Extractor</span></a> tool plug-in to
convert a particle system to use PhysX-based particles. Check the
"Convert to PhysX Rigid Particles" box and any particle systems
in the scene will be converted to use PhysX actors. The other
options for the tool plug-in control the PhysX scene that is
created to simulate the particles and any other PhysX content in
the scene. Other Gamebryo particle-system export settings apply,
but see the notes below for additional information.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Always try to put the particle system object at the origin in
Max with no scale or rotation. It does not matter where the
emitters are located. If the particle system is at the origin,
you can check the "PSys in PhysX Space" check-box in the <a href=
"../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX
Extractor</a> tool plug-in. This enables a run-time optimization
which avoids transformations on the particle state.</p>

<p>If particle rotation is enabled, then there are two options
for controlling the rotations. You may choose to use standard
particle system rotation controls, or take the rotations from the
PhysX actors. The behavior is controlled by the "Use PhysX
Rotations" check-box in the <a href=
"../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX
Extractor</a> tool plug-in.</p>

<p>The "Use Local Space PSystem" check-box in the Gamebryo Export
Params of the particle system modifier block is ignored by
Gamebryo-PhysX particles. The particles always move in the PhysX
global coordinate system. To obtain the same kind of behavior as
a local space PSystem you must animate the PhysX scene
transformation at run-time (you cannot author such an effect in
the tools).</p>
