<h1>General Texturing Considerations</h1>

<p>There are four issues you must keep in mind when adding textures to a
Gamebryo scene: the texture's dimensions, its aspect ratio, the effect of
filtering, and its size in VRAM. VRAM is the memory that is actually on the
graphics card that can be accessed quickly by the rendering hardware. The
framebuffer (the part of VRAM used to draw and display the screen) and the
Z-buffer both occupy some portion of VRAM and, thus, reduce the amount of
memory available for textures.</p>

<p>It is possible to have more textures than will fit in VRAM. In this case,
the graphics card will fetch the texture from system memory whenever it is
needed for rendering. This process is much slower than getting a texture from
VRAM and should be completely avoided on PCI graphics cards. It is not
necessary to completely avoid overflowing VRAM on AGP graphics cards but
performance will still degrade, as more textures have to be retrieved from
system memory. Other than avoiding it entirely (by fitting all textures into
VRAM) there is little you can do to improve the fetching of textures from
system memory.</p>

<h2>Texture Cropping/Resizing</h2>

<p>The first texturing issue is the hardware "Power of 2" issue. By default,
the Gamebryo 3ds max Plug-in will shrink any non-power of two textures to the
appropriate size using a quick but low-quality resizing technique. This
technique is fine for prototyping, however it is strongly recommended that you
resize all images to a power of two before exporting final assets. An exporter
option is available in the main export dialog to allow the export of
non-power-of-two textures. With this option checked, mipmapping will not be
available for non-power-of-two textures. Instead of using trilinear
interpolation, this texture will use bilinear interpolation. This is described
more in the Texture Filtering section below.</p>

<h2>Texture Aspect Ratios</h2>

<p>Second, textures in Gamebryo do not need to be square, but extreme aspect
ratios will fragment VRAM. This fragmenting occurs because odd-shaped textures
are not as easy to pack together as regularly shaped ones. In general, you
should only use aspect ratios of less than 8:1. Additionally, you should settle
on a base set of texture sizes. Textures with the same dimensions are easily
interchanged in VRAM allowing for quicker VRAM management schemes. Having a lot
of textures with widely varying sizes will defeat this replacement-based
texture management.</p>

<h2>Texture Filtering</h2>

<p>The third texturing issue is that pyramidal filtering (also known as
"mipmapping" or "trilinear interpolation" in Gamebryo) increases the VRAM size
of a texture by 1.3 times its original VRAM size. When pyramidal filtering (as
opposed to summed area or none) is enabled a texture must be stored along with
its filter levels where each level is a quarter the size of the prior level.
Pyramidal filtering will improve texture aliasing but you should be aware that
it comes at the cost of some space in VRAM. In other words, pyramidal filtering
improves visual quality in the scene and should be used in almost all cases,
but you should be aware that pyramidal filtered textures increase storage
requirements by a factor of 1.3.</p>

<p>There is another useful filtering mode for textures used on surfaces that
may be viewed nearly perpendicularly. Anisotropic filtering takes additional
samples in the direction of maximum anisotropy, up to a maximum count. This
maximum can be adjusted, and will be automatically clamped to what the runtime
hardware maximum is. If anisotropic filtering isn't supported by hardware, it
will be treated as trilinear filtering instead.</p>

<p>The image below shows anisotropic filtering at two quality levels compared
to trilinear filtering. The difference between trilinear and anisotropic
filtering increases as the gets more acute.</p>

            <div class="NDLNote">
                Anisotropic filtering can be very expensive, up to N times more
                expensive than trilinear filtering (where N is the quality /
                maximum number of samples). It should only be used in places
                where it will have visible impact, with N set to the smallest
                number that gives good results.
