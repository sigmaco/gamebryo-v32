<h1>Max Light Settings</h1>

<h2>Environmental Settings</h2>

<p>Your background color in Gamebryo 3ds max Plug-in is set from
Rendering \ Environment \ Common Parameters \ Background Color.
Just like for a still render. The Environment Map picker has no
effect in Gamebryo 3ds max Plug-in. Under the Global Lighting
section, The Ambient color controls an Ambient light value in
Gamebryo 3ds max Plug-in. If it is set to absolute black,
Gamebryo 3ds max Plug-in will not export this extra light.</p>

<h2>Light settings:</h2>

<p>We support omni (point), directional and spot lights out of
Max. The on/off flag cannot be animated. Animate color to black
if you want to turn your lights on and off. At 0,0,0 your light
is off. Inclusion and Exclusion lists are supported for
lights.</p>

<p>In the Gamebryo engine, there is no limit on the number of
ambient lights. However, in 3ds max, there is only one ambient
light. Therefore, scenes exported with lights from the Gamebryo
3ds max Plug-in will only have one ambient light. The 3ds max
ambient light color can be set in the
Rendering-&gt;Environment-&gt;Global Lighting options. If more
lights are needed, they will need to be set programmatically.</p>

<p>Omni lights and spotlights are exported with position and
direction. The position of 3ds max direct lights is ignored in
because in Gamebryo direct lights are infinite lights.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">

</div>

<p>This example, <a href=
"Where_to_Find_the_Max_Artist_Examples.htm">Quad vs Linear
lighting.max</a>, shows the ramping difference between Quadratic
(Inverse Square) falloff and Linear (Inverse) falloff on
attenuated lights. The group of spheres on the left are being lit
with Quadratic falloff while the spheres on the right are being
lit with Linear falloff. Each group of spheres is excluded from
the other set by the "Exclude / Include" list.</p>

<h3>Shadow settings</h3>

<p>By checking the 'Shadows On' flag in the General Parameters
rollout for a light, the light will export casting dynamic
shadows.</p>

<p>A light that casts dynamic shadows uses the size parameter in
the Shadow Map Params rollout as a hint to determine shadow map
size once in Gamebryo. If Use Automatic Bias is disabled, then
the Bias parameter will also be used. It is important to note
that the Shadow Map Params rollout will only be visible if Shadow
map is the selected shadow technique.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/GamebryoShadowParams.jpg" width="170"
    height="155" alt="GamebryoShadowParams (17K)"> 
    <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
</div>

<p>The Gamebryo Max Plug-in adds an additional rollout onto
lights called Gamebryo Shadow Params. This rollout allows you to
set the shadowing technique that the light uses as well as a few
other shadow mapping parameters. The Gamebryo shadowing system
can be extended to add additional shadowing techniques, each with
a unique appearance and performance considerations.</p>

<p>A static shadow map assumes that the shadowing light and all
of the casters will not be moving. This allows the light to
re-use the same shadow map without having to render each frame.
The benefit of using this over static lighting is that the shadow
receivers can be dynamic.</p>

<p>The Use Back Faces option allows the user to set which side of
the shadow casting object gets used to generate the shadow map.
If this option is turned on, the back faces of the casters are
the faces that cast the shadows. This reduces the shadowing
artifacts on object edges but can cause some objects not to be
shadowed when you expect them to, such as when an object is
inside another.</p>

<p>When a shadow casting light is converted, the Map size
parameter will determine what the desired size of the shadow map
will be. However, once running in Gamebryo, it may be more
efficient to re-use a shadow map of a different resolution
instead of creating a new one to match the desired size. This
improves performance, but may lead to lower quality results. If
it is important that a particular light always get the exact size
of shadow map that it wants, the Force Map Size option can be
turned on.</p>

<p>Sometimes shadow mapping can cause artifacts around edges of
objects or at object intersections. In such cases, it is desired
to be able to set the bias of the shadow map. Bias is
automatically set to a reasonable default that will be used.
However, if a custom bias is desired, uncheck the Use Automatic
Bias option. Once this has been done, you can use the Bias
parameter in the Shadow Map Params rollout to determine how much
the shadow map will shift shadows away or towards the casting
light source.</p>

<p>Some care should be taken when manually adjusting bias. Unlike
in Max, the bias parameter in Gamebryo is on a different scale
depending on what type of light and what shadow technique is
being used. In some cases, the number of decimal places that you
need to use to specify a good bias is more than the default that
Max provides. In this case, you can customize the precision of
spinners by going to Customize-&gt;Preferences, then in the
Spinners section of the General tab, increase the precision
option.</p>

<h3>Attenuation</h3>

<p>Attenuation is supported for Omni and Spot lights only, and
converted as follows:</p>

<!--(Table)=========================================================-->
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Omni/Spot light Attenuation Decay Type</th>

            <th>Gamebryo Attenuation</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>None</td>

            <td>Constant</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Inverse</td>

            <td>Linear</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Inverse Square</td>

            <td>Quadratic</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>See the <a href=
"Where_to_Find_the_Max_Artist_Examples.htm">Quad vs Linear
lighting.max</a> file for a visual example of the difference
between Linear and Quadratic light fall off.</p>

<p>Only the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Far Attenuation</span>
values have effect on lights in Gamebryo. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Decay type</span> must be on for light
attenuation to work. "Light Cone: Falloff" angle for Spot lights
is exported. "Light Cone: Hotspot" angle for Spot lights is
exported when using the shader pipeline. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Atmospheres &amp; Effects</span> rollout is not
currently supported. </p>

<h3>Projected Effects</h3>

<p>If you load a map into the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Projector Parameters</span> rollout it will
project a light map. To project a shadow, load it under the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Shadow Parameters</span> rollout,
under Map. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Light Affects Shadow
Color</span> option makes the projected map an environment maps.
Once a light has become a projected or environment map, it is no
longer a 'light' in the traditional sense. It is a projected
texture effect.</p>

<h3>Include / Exclude</h3>

<p>The Include / Exclude list is one important and easy way to
manage your dynamic lights. If a light has included objects,
everything that is not in the include list is ignored by that
light. If nothing is in the Include / Exclude list then
everything will be lit by the light. If a light has excluded
objects, everything that is in the exclude list is ignored by the
light and the rest of the scene will be lit by the light.</p>
