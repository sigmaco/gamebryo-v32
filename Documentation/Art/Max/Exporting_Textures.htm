<h1>Exporting Textures</h1>

<p>Textures can be exported inside the main NIF, separate 
 NIFs, and in their original form. These options can be set globally using 
 the <a href="Gamebryo_3ds_max_Export_Options1.htm">Export 
 dialog</a> or can be set individually using the <a href="Texture_Conversion_Custom_Attributes.htm">Texture 
 Conversion Custom Attributes</a>. The following sections will discuss 
 the pluses and minuses of each approach. </p>

<p>An option to allow the export of non-power-of-two textures 
 is available. This is discussed in more detail below.</p>

<h3>Main NIF Textures</h3>

<p>Use of main NIF textures makes the master NIF file a 
 self-contained complete package. It will rely on no other files to finish 
 loading and can therefore be loaded faster. Texture formatting and reduction 
 can occur at export if this approach is taken. However, the images cannot 
 be altered post-export while they are in this form. Texture sharing can 
 still occur in this form to reduce memory consumption, but each master 
 NIF file will have all of the data stored in the file. At load time, the 
 duplicate texture data is discarded in favor of the already loaded version 
 from a previous master NIF in memory.</p>

<p>In addition, internal textures provide the option of 
 having platform-specific source texture renderer data loaded directly 
 into a renderer-specific resource at application load time, with the result 
 that no texture format conversions are required at load time. These capabilities 
 operate on the principle of streaming persistent versions of source texture 
 renderer data (<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData.htm">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</a></span>) 
 to support platform-specific texture format conversions for &quot;internal 
 textures&quot; (those included in a scene's NIF file) at export time. 
 Assuming that the specific platform can support the pixel format in question 
 at application load time, the renderer will load the persistent source 
 texture renderer data directly into a renderer-specific resource, bypassing 
 the application-level <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span> 
 object and all <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiImageConverter.htm">NiImageConverter</a></span>-based 
 texture conversion at load time entirely. See <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Programmer/Object_Systems/Streaming.htm#TextureStreamingOptions">Texture 
 Streaming Options</a></span> for Internal Textures or the export options 
 for <a href="Gamebryo_3ds_max_Export_Options1.htm">3ds 
 max</a> or <a href="../Maya/Export_Display_Options.htm">Maya</a> 
 for more details.</p>

<p><b>Note: If application requirements 
 dictate fully general support of textures within a NIF file on multiple 
 platforms or graphics cards, then <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span>-based 
 textures should be used</b>, since they enable on the fly texture format 
 conversions at load time. For example, DX9-specific textures may be problematic, 
 since there are so many diverse graphics cards your application may have 
 to support. To specify <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span>-based 
 textures for export from the art packages, you may select &quot;generic&quot; 
 platform type, but include textures in the main NIF, for example.</p>

<p>Note that each time a platform SDK (e.g., Xbox360 XDK, 
 Playstation3 SDK, or Revolution SDK) changes, there is at least a possibility 
 that the new SDK will cause textures to be formatted differently on that 
 platform. It is not likely to happen frequently, but the possibility exists. 
 In such a case, it may be desirable to re-export Nifs containing platform-specific 
 textures using exporters built with that platform's most recent SDK version.</p>

<h3>Separate NIF Textures</h3>

<p>Separate NIF Textures makes the master NIF reliant on 
 other NIF files to properly load. Each unique texture in the scene will 
 be stored in its own NIF file. These texture NIF files can be shared amongst 
 multiple master NIF files. Texture formatting and reduction can occur 
 at export if this approach is taken. However, the images cannot be altered 
 post-export while they are in this form. This option can be slower to 
 load on consoles than the Main NIF textures due to the seek times for 
 finding the additional NIF texture files.</p>

<h3>Original Images</h3>

<p>Original Images makes the master NIF reliant on the 
 original image files to load properly. Each unique image file must be 
 copied to the location in which textures are shared. If you enable the
 Copy External option, the original textures will be copied to the export
 location. Alternatively, this can be done easily with the Resource Collector 
 utility provided by Max. However, only supported Gamebryo image types can 
 be shared as Original Images. Unsupported types will be exported as Separate 
 NIF textures. Another advantage of this approach is that it allows continued 
 modification of the image after export. This option can be slower to load on 
 consoles than the Main NIF textures due to the seek times for finding the 
 additional texture files. This option may also fragment memory due to the 
 fact that intermediary pixels must be created before the renderer can 
 consume this image. </p>

<h3>Original Images VRAM</h3>

<p>This option is the same as the Original Images option 
 above with one major exception: the files are directly loaded into the 
 renderer data without an intermediary representation in Gamebryo. This 
 allows for image formats that are not directly supported in Gamebryo and 
 potentially faster load times. </p>

<h3>Allow NPOT Textures</h3>

<p>Checking the 'Allow NPOT textures' option will allow 
 non-power-of-two textures to be exported without resizing. Non-power-of-two 
 textures will have different capabilities on different graphics cards 
 and can impact performance so it is usually better to use power of two 
 textures instead. If this option is not checked, the default behavior is 
 to size the texture down to its nearest power-of-two dimensions and give 
 the user a warning when the exporter encounters a non-power-of-two texture. 
 If this option is checked, any non-power-of-two texture that is encountered 
 will be exported without mipmap support even if filtering mode is set 
 to pyramidal.</p>
