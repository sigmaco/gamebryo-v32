<h1>BoneLOD in Gamebryo</h1>

<p>BoneLOD allows you to dynamically adjust how many bones in a
skeleton will affect its skin. This system does not work with the
standard LOD system. Instead, you can reduce both polygon count
and the number of bones for different LODs by changing either the
Mesh LOD or the BoneLOD. When the character is close, all the
bones influence the skin. Far away, when the character occupies
only a few pixels on the screen, feet, fingertips, hair, and ear
bones stop influencing the mesh. The result is that characters
render much faster, allowing more characters to be on screen at
one time. This makes the scene much more realistic. Most
importantly, it is very easy for the artist to set up BoneLODs
inside of 3ds Max or Maya. For an example Max file, please see
the documentation on <a href="Bone_LOD.htm">Bone LOD.max</a>.</p>

<p>Let's step though a sample and add a bone LOD system to a
character we'll call "Momma Lenguin".</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/image001.jpg" width="252" height="332" alt="Momma Lenguin (8K)" />
    <p class="FigureCaption">Momma Lenguin</p>
</div>

<ol>
    <li>Momma has been designed with 28 bones, which allows very
    lifelike animations of wingtips, ears, and the ends of her
    toes when she is the center of attention on screen. Using
    BoneLOD will prevent these bones from updating when she is in
    the distance. To do this, start with the Utility rollout and
    choose Maxscript: Gamebryo LOD Utility.

        <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img src="images/image002_03.jpg" width="183" height="303" alt="Gamebryo Bone LOD tool (11K)" />
        </div>
    </li>

    <li>Assign her "Actor LOD Root node" to the top bone of her
    hierarchy. In this case, it is called 'Momma's Bip01'. The
    Add button at the top of the GUI is depressed to do the
    assignment. The system now knows the root and hierarchy of
    the individual actor. All of the bones in the actor must be
    underneath this root. It is recommended to assign all of the
    nodes under this root as bones, because only assigned bones
    can be used as fallbacks for lower levels of detail.</li>

    <li>After this is completed, press the "LOD Paint Mode"
    button to paint the bone assignments for each level of
    detail. When in "LOD Paint Mode", everything except the
    bird's bones disappears. This makes working with the bone
    group easier. Note that the "Current LOD Level" spinner is
    set to 0. This is the default LOD and contains all of the
    bones in the scene. Change the "Current LOD Level" spinner to
    1. The bones are now transparent because none of them are
    included in an active LOD level yet.</li>

    <li>In order to add bones to the current LOD level, first
    click Add, and then select all the bones that you wish to
    assign to this LOD.</li>

    <li>The bones will turn solid, indicating they are now set to
    be active for level 1. For this example, we have added all of
    the bones in LOD 0 to LOD 1. Next, switch the spinner to LOD
    2, and all the bones will turn transparent again. Select just
    the influential bones, leaving out the ear ends, wing tips
    and toes. It is important to choose LOD levels in a
    hierarchical manner. For example, if a leg bone is not
    selected in a particular LOD level, then the foot bone (which
    is a child of the leg bone) must also not be selected. If
    this does not happen, then bone LOD cannot be applied.</li>

    <li>Next, switch the spinner to LOD 3, and select just the 5
    main bones that influence the body and leg ends. At a far
    distance this will look fine, and updating 5 bones is much
    faster than updating 28.

        <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img src="images/image003_02.jpg" width="588" height="276" alt="Three different BoneLODs for Momma Lenguin (21K)" />
        </div>
        
			<p class="indent1">The 3 different BoneLODs for
            the Momma Lenguin. The far left skeleton has 28
            active and influential bones while the one on the
            right has five.</p>

    </li>

    <li>Now that the bones are assigned, skins can also be
    assigned to our three BoneLODs to further help performance.
    There are high-resolution and low-resolution versions of the
    character mesh. The high-resolution mesh will be used for
    BoneLODs 0 through 2, and the low-resolution mesh will be
    used for BoneLOD 3.

        <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img src="images/image004_02.jpg" width="324" height="244" alt="High- and low-resolution meshes (11K)" />
        </div>
    </li>

    <li>Select the high-resolution skin and press "Add" under the
    "Skin List" dialog. This adds the skin to the LOD group. Set
    the high spinner to 1 and the low spinner to 2, which means
    that this skin will be used for BoneLODs 0 through 2.</li>

    <li>Now select the low-resolution skin and select the "Add"
    button in the "Skin List" dialog. Set both the low and high
    spinners to 3 so it will show up only at BoneLOD 3.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's all there is to it. Momma will render fast when she is
far away and still look beautiful up close. The final step is to
make sure that the animations look as good as we expect using the
Gamebryo Animation Tool.</p>

<p>This screenshot is from frame 29 of her jump animation at both
BoneLOD levels. The one on the left uses 29 bones, and the one on
the right uses 5 bones. There is a difference in the skin, but at
a distance it is not noticeable. If the lower level BoneLOD is
not to our liking, we can easily adjust the number of bones in
each level. This technique was used to create a realistic scene
with more than 250 independently animated Lenguins on screen at
one time.</p>
