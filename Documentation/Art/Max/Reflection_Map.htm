<h1>Reflection Map</h1>

<p>Much like the Blinn standard shader, Gamebryo supports an environmental
reflection map slot.</p>

<p>Environment maps are r,g,b maps that are added to the base texture to
simulate mirror-like reflection of the environment surrounding the mapped
object. Often used with a gloss map, this effect can be very striking, giving a
very realistic impression of a mirrored object.</p>

<p>Although any form of texture coordinate mapping may be used with environment
maps, Gamebryo environment maps use sphere mapping or cube mapping as their
texture coordinate generation method. This fact is because the pixels in an
environment map generally represent the color seen in a given direction in
camera space, not at a given position. As a result, environment maps should be
mapped using a method that maps direction vectors, rather than positions into
the map.</p>

<p>An object may have only one environment map applied at a time. Currently, if
more than one environment map is applied to the same object, any one of the
environment maps may be used. Applications should not depend upon any
particular behavior in this case, and should avoid it whenever
possible.</p>

<a name="Spherical_Environment_Map" id="Spherical_Environment_Map"></a><h2>Spherical Environment Map</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In general, environment maps are designed to represent the light coming from
the scene in each world-space direction. Note that by default, sphere mapping
currently maps from world space, not camera The benefit of such a switch is
that it allows applications with moving cameras to use an environment map that
is "locked" in world space. As the camera moves around the environment-mapped
object, the reflection changes correctly, without any intervention from the
application. Each pixel represents a different direction in space. Since
environment maps are added to the base texture, applications must be careful
not to use extremely bright images for their environment maps, except in the
few pixels that represent directions of specular highlights.</p>

<p>However, some renderers may supply additional functions that allow
applications to switch the sphere-mapping behavior from world-space to
camera-space. See the renderer documentation for details on the support (or
lack thereof) for this feature.</p>

<p>With world-space diffuse sphere mapping enabled (as is the default in most
renderers), the sphere map image is oriented as follows in the model space of
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span> object created by the
exporter.</p>

<p>The exporter will align the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span> to the model's coordinate system so that
when a camera is looking directly at the model and aligned with its axes, the
2D texture for the environment map will match up with the world-space axes of
the model. This is illustrated in the image below:</p>

<p>Please see the <a href=
"../../Programmer/Texturing/World_Space_Environment_Mapping.htm">programmer
documentation</a> on spherical environment maps for more detail</p>

<h3>How to Apply</h3>

<p>When a standard <a href="Bitmap_Texture.htm">Bitmap Texture</a> is added to
the Reflection Map slot, it will be used as a spherical environment map. An
artist may want to "spherize" the map to make maximum usage of the reflection.
Note that Gamebryo represents these environment maps as separate objects,
called <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffects.</span> The exporter will
generally place these objects at the root of the scene graph.</p>

<p>This map can also be specified using a <a href="Environment_Maps.htm">light
source</a>.</p>

<a name="Cubic_Environment_Maps" id="Cubic_Environment_Maps"></a><h2>Cubic Environment Map</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Cube maps are form of texture map that maps 3D unit vectors into colors.
They avoid many of the problems that occur with sphere
maps&mdash;discontinuities, inability to render to them, etc. However, they are
only supported on some platforms and hardware and are by no means
universal.</p>

<p>The basic concept of a cube map is a unit cube with six sides, centered at
the origin. Each face of the cube can be thought of as a 2x2 unit square, lying
in each of the following planes: X=1, X=.1, Y=1, Y=.1, Z=1, Z=.1. Each cube
face is a square texture that represents a 90-degree field-of-view image shot
from the origin, facing out in the given direction. Put together, these six
images form a one-to-one mapping of directions to texels. The figure below
shows how the cube faces may be visualized in the world-space Max coordinate
system:</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/MaxCubeMaps.gif" width="528" height="248" alt=
    "MaxCubeMaps (3K)"> <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
</div>

<p>Because each of the faces is square, flat and represents a 90-degree field
of view, it is very easy to use these textures in such a way that the cube map
can represent an entire scene as viewed from a given point at a given time.
Please see the <a href="../../Programmer/Texturing/Cube_Maps.htm">programmer
documentation</a> on cube maps for more detail</p>

<p>Note that Gamebryo represents these environment maps as separate objects,
called <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffects.</span> The exporter will
generally place these objects at the root of the scene graph.</p>

<h3>How to Apply</h3>

<a name="DDS_Cube_Map_Files" id="DDS_Cube_Map_Files"></a><h4>DDS Cube Map Files</h4>

<p>When a DDS file containing a cube map <a href="Bitmap_Texture.htm">Bitmap
Texture</a> is added to the Reflection Map slot, it will be used as a cubic
environment map. It is important to note the differences in coordinate axes
between DirectX and 3ds Max. The figure below shows how the cube faces may be
visualized in the world-space DirectX coordinate system:</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/image030.gif" width="527" height="247" alt=
    "image030 (4K)"> <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
</div>

<a name="Reflection_Refraction_Maps" id="Reflection_Refraction_Maps"></a><h4>Reflection/Refraction Maps</h4>

<p>The Reflection/Refraction map can be used to create an environment map. The
cube map can only be exported if it was created from a file. However, Max will
happily generate a cube map with the correct faces and names for you using the
UI in the Render Cubic Map Files group. The "Use Environment Map" flag in the
Source group has been overloaded by the exporter. Turning this checkbox on will
generate a texture effect with a specular cube map. Turning it off will
generate a diffuse cube map.</p>

<p>The figure below shows how the cube faces are specified in the
Reflection/Refraction Map relative to the Max coordinate system. Note that the
orientations for the faces are from the perspective of an observer standing
outside the cube looking at the center of the cube.</p>

</div>

<p>The images below are screenshots of the Reflect/Refract map in the diffuse
cube map state and the resulting Gamebryo render. Please see the sample,
