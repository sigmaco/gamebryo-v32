<h1>Projected Light Maps</h1>

<p>Projected light maps are used for effects like a slide projector or a
stained glass window. There are two types of projected lights. A perspective
projected type where the image is projected from a single nearby point (e.g.
the slide projector) and a parallel projected type where the image is projected
from far away (e.g. the stained glass window). Few graphics cards currently
support perspective projected lights so they should be used cautiously.</p>

<ul>
    <li>To specify these effects in Max an image needs to be placed in the
    Projector Map slot of a Direct or Spotlight.</li>

    <li>Using a Direct light will result in a parallel projection, while using
    a Spotlight will result in a perspective projection.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Gamebryo, projected light maps act like dark maps so the slide projector
and stained glass window examples are somewhat misleading. Projected light maps
are multiplied with the base texture. The resulting combination is then
multiplied by vertex colors or dynamic vertex lighting to get the final lit
result. As with dark maps, if a portion of the projected light map is black,
that area of the final result will be black and where the projected light map
is white the base texture will show through. Applying a dark map in addition to
a projected light map will cause the two multi-textures to be added together
before they are multiplied by the base map (so their effects will sum
together).</p>

<p>To use dynamic lighting with a projected texture, the negative space
(usually the borders) of the projected map must be gray or some other non-black
color. As with dark maps, this technique will allow the dynamic lights to
influence whatever the projected light map does not directly light. If the
negative space is black, dynamic lights cannot affect it.</p>

<p>In using projected textures, you may discover an unexpected (and perhaps
undesirable) side effect: parallel and perspective projected texture
projections are bi-directional. That is, the textures are projected infinitely
in both directions. For example, a projected spotlight effect that is applied
to an entire room will produce a circle of light on two walls&mdash;the wall
that is directly in front of the projection, and the wall that is directly
behind it. Gamebryo does support "clipped" projected textures. In order to
enable clipping, a user must add "NiClipPlane = true" to the User Property
buffer of the light. This will add a clipping plane behind the light. Note that
enabling this feature may decrease performance as additional work must be done
to clip the texture.</p>
