<h1>Nodes and 3ds Max</h1>

<p>The Gamebryo Max plug-in supports Nodes by adding a Gamebryo
NiNode to the scene graph. This NiNode serves the same function
as a Node in that it contains position, rotation, and uniform
scale. Just as Nodes can be linked together to form a hierarchy,
Gamebryo NiNodes are linked together to form a matching
hierarchy. Usually, when an object is created in Max two objects
are actually created. The first object is a Node with all of the
transforms for the object. The second object is the Max object
itself (i.e. a Camera or PolyShape). Gamebryo will preserve this
relationship by creating a corresponding NiNode with the
corresponding NiObject (i.e. an NiCamera or NiMesh) as its first
child.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that Max Nodes can support non-uniform scale,
all scales are pushed down to the leaves of the scene graph. A
leaf in a scene graph is an NiNode or NiObject with no children.
In the case of non-uniform scale, these units are pushed down
into the vertices themselves for geometry. Please see the
Animation documentation on <a href=
"Position__Rotation__And_Scale.htm">Position, Rotation, And
Scale</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <a href=
"../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Scene_Graph_Optimization.htm">Gamebryo
Optimization plug-in</a>, part of the <a href=
"Scripting_the_Art_Pipeline_in_3ds_Max.htm">"Default Process
Script"</a> used when exporting or viewing a
file will attempt to compress the structure of the scene graph.
This will involve deleting nodes with no children, merging the
parent and child if there is only one child, and merging
complementary geometry if they are siblings. This behavior can be
overridden by adding an <a href=
"Quick_Reference.htm">"NiOptimizeKeep"</a> tag to the User
Defined Properties of the Node. Alternatively, the <a href=
"NiOptimization_Helper.htm">NiOptimization toolbar utility</a>
can be used to set the tag.</p><a name="Billboard_Nodes" id=
"Billboard_Nodes"></a>

<h2>Billboard_Nodes</h2>

<p>Gamebryo allows the user to specify a billboard node using the
user-defined properties of a Node in Max. A billboard node will
orient itself to face the camera within certain constraints.
These constraints and a utility to set them up are discussed in
the documentation for the <a href=
"Billboard_Utilities_Panel.htm">Billboard Utilities Panel</a>. To
see examples of this node type, please look at the samples
documentation for <a href=
"Billboard_and_billboardUp.htm">Billboard and
billboardUp</a>.</p><a name="Sort_Adjust_Nodes" id=
"Sort_Adjust_Nodes"></a>

<h2>Sort_Adjust_Nodes</h2>

<p>In some cases an artist may wish to override how alpha blended
objects are sorted in the scene. In Gamebryo (when using the
NiAlphaAccumulator, which is enabled by most applications and
Gamebryo tools), alpha blended objects are rendered after all of
the opaque objects have been rendered, and the alpha-blended
objects are drawn sorted from back to front when rendered. Since
this sorting order is likely to change as the camera moves
through the world, visual pops or other anomalies may be seen in
the alpha blended objects in some cases. This is especially true
in the cases where several alpha blended objects are layered on
top of each other, as in hair or terrain. Please see the samples
documentation, <a href="Sort_Adjust_Nodes.htm">Sort Adjust
Nodes</a> for Max file examples of this.</p>

<p>To specify an NiSortAdjustNode, create a new dummy node and
edit the User-Defined Properties for the new dummy node to
contain the text "NiSortAdjustNode = XXXXXX". The string,
"XXXXXX", should be one of the following options listed in the
sections below.</p>

<h3>SORTING_OFF</h3>

<p>When the string value is SORTING_OFF, the resulting
NiSortAdjustNode turns off sorting for all of the child geometry
objects of the node. Children will be blended into the scene the
order they are stored in the parent node. This is very effective
for artists to control the blending of layers of hair or terrain
textures. Almost all NiSortAdjustNodes inserted into a scene
graph will use this mode, as it gives the artist direct control
over the sorting of the objects under the node</p>

<p>Note that an NiSortAdjustNode set to SORTING_OFF will override
any NiSortAdjustNodes below it, as discussed below under
SORTING_INHERIT.</p>

<h3>SORTING_INHERIT</h3>

<p>When the string value is SORTING_INHERIT, the NiSortAdjustNode
causes its children to inherit the sorting behavior of its parent
(on or off). Since this flag does not change the behavior of
sorting as-is, it may seem a strange mode to specify. However,
this mode will insert an NiSortAdjustNode into the scene during
export. While the default behavior of this node will be to act
like any other scene graph node, the programmer has the ability
to find this NiSortAdjustNode from within the application code,
and can change it to SORTING_OFF as needed. This mode is normally
useful only in conjunction with special application code</p>

<p>Note that this mode is <em>not</em> equivalent to turning
sorting back on - if this NiSortAdjust node is a child (either
immediate or deep down in the tree) of a another NiSortAdjustNode
that is set to SORTING_OFF, then the children of this
SORTING_INHERIT node will also have sorting turned off. As a
result, it is rarely useful to nest NiSortAdjustNodes.</p>
