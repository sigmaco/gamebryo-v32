<h1>Animation Manager Reference and Description</h1>

<h2>Actors Panel</h2>

<p>This panel gives information about the actor root for 
 this animation. This actor root should be an object at the top of the 
 hierarchy containing all of the animations that you want to be
 extracted into kf files. For biped characters, this is usually the 
 Bip01 or Root bone.</p>

            the scene. Selecting from this list will set the
            current Actor Root for this plug-in. It was included
            in case you have a character that rides a horse,
            dragon, etc or when you need to actors to be in
            sync.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Accumulation Root</td>

            <td>View the name of the
            current Accumulation Root of the actor (usually the
            Actor Root). You can use this field if you are
            accumulating animations. This is where all
            accumulated translations, scales, and rotations are
            applied. An example of this idea would be a walking
            forward animation in which the character actually
            translates in space. Setting the Bip01 to be the
            Accumulation Root will allow the character to
            continue to translate forward without the skip back
            to the translation specified by the first key when
            the animation loops.<br>
            <br>
            When exported, the Accumulation Root is divided into
            two nodes. One node stores the animation that needs
            to be accumulated, while the other stores the
            animation that does not get accumulated. Because this
            divide is made, it is important that your
            accumulation root does not use a non-standard
            animation controller such as a path controller.
            Additionally, the accumulation root should not be a
            bone influencing a skinned mesh. Since the exported
            nodes animations are split between two nodes, you may
            see serious skinning artifacts.</td>

                the time slider indicates the state of the base

                range can cause undesirable results upon export
                unless you set your time back to include that
                first frame. This capability is meant as a

<h2>Active Layer Panel</h2>

<p>    This panel gives information about the various 
 Layer Roots of the current Actor Root. Layer Roots are meant to allow 
 flexibility in mixing animations. For instance, you could mix and match 
 a walk animation and an arm wave animation using layer roots. One Layer 
 Root would control the arm and another Layer Root would control the hips.</p>
