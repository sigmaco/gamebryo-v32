<h1>Skinning and Morphing with 3ds Max</h1>

<h2>Skinning for Artists</h2>

<p>There are a few important bits of hardware knowledge that a
character animator and modeler should be aware of before jumping
into skinning a character. The hardware skinning pipeline is
broken into two important numbers, the maximum number of bones
the hardware can handle and the maximum number of bones that can
influence a vertex. Each number has an important role to play in
determining how your skinned character will perform in a
game.</p>

<p>The maximum number of bones the hardware can handle by default
for most platforms is four. What exactly does this mean? Four is
a really small number for a character. Behind the scenes,
Gamebryo will break the skinned mesh apart into pieces that obey
this limit. These pieces are referred to as <em>skin
partitions</em>. For each partition we generate, we have to
render the partition's geometry in a separate rendering call. For
instance, a skinned character with 28 bones could be broken into
23 partitions in order to obey the maximum bone limit. This means
that we are rendering the model in 23 separate pieces.
Furthermore, each partition can only be composed of the vertices
that use only those bones. If you're not careful in your weight
assignments, you could end up with a partition with only one
triangle!</p>

<p>The maximum number of bones influencing a vertex by default on
most platforms is also four. This means that a vertex that is
influenced by five or more bones will only use the four most
influential bones in its skinning. This may result in cracks in
sections where many bones come together like the back of the neck
and the crotch. Careful modeling and weight assignment will help
to minimize this problem. This does not mean that you should
always use four bones per vertex. In fact, it is best to use as
few weights as are visually acceptable per vertex. This will help
substantially when partitioning the mesh because more vertices
will be able to fit into a partition.</p>

<p>What should you take away from this discussion? First off, how
you skin your character will directly transfer into performance
for that character. Listed below are some useful hints on how to
analyze your skinning performance and tips for getting good
performance in general.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Do not use N-Links when skinning with Physique. Stick
    with No Blending or 2-Links.</li>

    <li>Use the <a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Skin_Analyzer.htm">SkinAnalyzer
    plug-in</a> to see how exactly your skin was broken apart
    into partitions.</li>

    <li>Use the <a href=
    "Gamebryo_3ds_max_Export_Options1.htm">Skin Weight Threshold
    export option</a> to drop weights that are trivial. This will
    greatly improve performance. Be careful to make sure that odd
    skinning artifacts do not result when this value is
    raised.</li>

    <li>Use a <a href=
    "Introduction_to_Using_Pixel_and_Vertex_Shaders_in_Max.htm">pixel/vertex
    shader for skinning</a>. This can really boost your
    performance if you can accept the fact that the shader will
    not work on cards that are not compliant with the version of
    pixel and vertex shader used. Often you can reduce the
    partition count to one or two using shaders.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Physique vs. Skin modifier</h2>

<p>The Gamebryo Max Plug-in supports the two major modifiers for
skinning. We have found the recent versions of Skin to be more
reliable and robust then Physique, even when applied to bipeds,
however both are supported.</p>

<p>Gamebryo doesn't support floating bones for physique. If your
model requires this capability, we suggest modeling with Skin
instead of physique. In the Physique Level-Of-Detail panel, we
only support Rigid Skin Update. When using Deformable, the
exporter treats it like Rigid.</p>

<h2>Linking your skinned object</h2>

<p>Do not attach a skin to a bone in the hierarchy below that to
which the skin is bound. This causes the mesh to translate twice,
once for the skin binding and another for the child translation.
You can create a node above the Bip01or base node to which the
skin is attached, or use a character node to organize a bone
structure and skin together.</p>

<p>The mesh that has the Skin or Physique modifier uses the bones
to determine its bounding volume. The hierarchy is updated by a
depth-first traversal of the scene. If the skin occurs before the
bones in a depth first traversal of the scene, the skin's
bounding volume will lag one frame. Move the skin so that it
occurs after the bone hierarchy in a depth first traversal to
avoid this problem.</p>

<h2>Scaling your skinned object</h2>

<p>Do not scale a mesh after binding. If you scale a mesh you
must unbind it first and rebind it after it has been properly
scaled and translated. Scale it first and reset its transforms
before you bind it to the bone system for best results.</p>

<h2>Morph and Skin work together</h2>

<p>Even though we support combining skin &amp; morph targets we
do not suggest it. If you want to make a character have facial
animation morph targets, detach the head from the rest of the
body and have it attached to the head bone as a direct link. The
head mesh can use a morph target and translate via its relation
with the head bone while the body uses a skin or physique
modifier. When both modifiers are combined on a mesh it is much
slower as all the vertices are being transformed twice, once in
software and once in hardware. Please take this into
consideration when making characters that have facial expression.
See the section on <a href=
"Morphing_Faces_on_Skinned_Characters.htm">Morphing Faces on
Skinned Characters</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Morph Targets</h2>

<p>The Morph Modifier and Morph compound object are both
supported in Gamebryo. We have found the Morph Modifier more
reliable then the compound object in Max. Morph is inherently
slower than skinning due to the fact that morphing is still done
in software. However, there are many things that are easier to do
with morph targets than with bone movement. Suggested uses for
Morph targets are things like animated flags, facial expression
and non-uniform scales.</p>

<h2>Instancing with Skinning and Morphing</h2>

<p>Objects that are skinned or morphed are exported such that
clones (instances) are independently controlled and animated.
However, when the <a href=
"../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Mesh_Instancing.htm">Mesh
Instancing tool plug-in</a> is used, CPU skinned and morphed
objects that are instances or exact copies in the Max scene will
be exported as hardware instances. As a result, there is only one
animated object and every other instance appears exactly the
same. Move CPU skinned and morphed instances to another Max scene
or use export selected to prevent this behavior when using the
Mesh Instancing plug-in.</p>

<h2>Reading Skin Analyzer Plug-in Output</h2>

<p>The following section is a sample output from the skin
analyzer plug-in.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">

</div>

<p>The model was broken into 23 partitions out of 28 bones. This
model will likely perform moderately well. The key problems come
around partition 19 in the list. Here we drop below 40 triangles
per partition. At this point we are paying a fair amount of
overhead for 6 partitions that don't have that many triangles in
them. DirectX especially pays for this overhead. Often, this is
unavoidable in modeling as some sections are the nexus of many
bones and will be prone to small partitions (the neck and groin
in particular). In general, the thing to be wary of is when the
number of partitions exceeds the number of bones. This is
horrible for performance because it also means that many of the
partitions are incredibly small.</p>

<p>Listed below the main chunk of text is a breakdown of each
partition. This lists the bones involved in that partition and
what the average weights were for that bone. This text can often
be useful in pinpointing problem vertices since the bones in that
partition would influence them</p>
