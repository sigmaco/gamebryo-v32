<h1>Static Lighting</h1>

<p>There are many ways to optimize your lights so it looks like
you have many lights in your scene when you only have one or two
real-dynamic lights. This technique is called Static lighting. 
You "burn" lighting into your geometry on a vertex or pixel level
ahead of time, giving it the appearance of being lit. This
technique is how most engines get such nice lighting while
running at a decent frame rate. Static lighting can be done on a
Vertex level by painting the vertices or on a pixel level when
you need very detailed shadows by assigning Dark or Light Maps to
your materials.</p>

<h2>Shading with Vertex Colors</h2>

<p>Using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Vertex paint</span>
modifier or the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Assign Vertex
Colors</span> utility for vertex painting. To see the object in
the max view port you need to check the 'Show vertex colors' flag
in the User Defined Properties dialog of the object. The
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Gamebryo Shader</span> must have the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Vertex Color</span> flag set on. The
following modes will affect how this vertex lighting interacts
with the environment:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Src Mode</span> is
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">Amb-Dif</span>, then the vertex
    colors will be modulated onto your textures. This modulation
    will make them darker only, since white represents the
    original texture value. Dynamic lights (3ds max lights) in
    your scene will still affect them.</li>

    <li>If the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Src Mode</span> is
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">Emissive</span>, the vertex
    colors are 'self-illuminating' your textures. They are
    statically lit by the vertex colors. This is the mode you
    would use for a completely static scene. If they are included
    in a light list, the vertex colors will be additive to the
    light color and will eventually wash out to white. Creating
    this mode in Max is tricky, as Max likes to include
    lights.</li>

    <li>The third mode, <span class="NDLSystemFont">Ignore</span>
    should not be used for lighting, as it is for using the
    vertex colors for non-visual data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shading with Dark Maps</h2>

<p>To create Dark-Maps for intricate shadows, you must render the
shadows from a view port that matches how you want to map it,
ending up with a grayscale lighting stencil. There are many
different ways to pre-generate Dark Maps. Radiosity baked into a
texture and manual generation are the two most common
methods.</p>

<p>Once you have a nice shadow map, use a new UVW channel to map
it onto your object with a new <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UVW</span> modifier. Load the shadow map through
the Dark-Map load button in the Gamebryo .</p>

<p>When lights are not moving in a scene, do not use dynamic
lighting if at all possible. You should use vertex colors or dark
maps. Giving all your lights attenuation is important to help
with this. If you find it easier to use dynamic lights to light
your scene, your programmer may be able to process your scene by
automatically burning in dynamic lights into the vertex colors
for you. Check with your programmer if you need this option.</p>
