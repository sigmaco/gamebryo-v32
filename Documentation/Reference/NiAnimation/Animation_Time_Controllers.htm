<h1>Animation Time Controllers</h1>

<p>Different time controllers can control various attributes of
the object to which they are attached. For example, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiTransformController.htm">NiTransformController</a></span>
objects animate the model-space transforms of various objects
based on the time, while <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiMorphWeightsController.htm">NiMorphWeightsController</a></span>
objects affect the locations of vertices in the object's vertex
mesh. Obviously, a time controller cannot be attached to an
object that does not have any attributes which are manipulated by
the time controller. So an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMorphWeightsController</span> cannot be
attached to an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span>, since
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span> objects do not have a
vertex mesh for the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMorphWeightsController</span> to manipulate. In
such a case, any attempt to attach the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMorphWeightsController</span> will fail.</p>

<p>More than one type of time controller can be attached to a
given object so that multiple attributes are animated. However,
it is important to understand what aspects of an object the time
controllers manipulate to prevent problems when using more than
one type at a time. For example, if there are two <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTransformController</span> objects attached to
an object, whichever controller is updated last will write its
results to the local transform of the object, overwriting any
results placed there by the first controller. There are some
cases where the controllers are able to work in conjunction, but
such cases are an exception rather than a rule.</p>

<p>All animation controllers are based on the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTimeController.htm">NiTimeController</a></span>
class, which provides basic timing functionality. For structural
reasons, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTimeController</span>
class itself is located in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMain/Hyperlinked_Hierarchy_of_Classes.htm">NiMain</a></span>
library, and is therefore documented with the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMain</span> library. Each time controller has a
frequency and phase value that is applied to the time passed into
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> call for that
controller. In addition, two other timing attributes may be
specified: <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTimeController.htm#Enumerations">CycleType</a></span>
and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTimeController.htm#Enumerations">AnimType</a></span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CycleType</span> determines
what the controller does at the end of an animation cycle: loop
back to the beginning, clamp to the end of the cycle, or reverse
to achieve a ping-pong effect. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AnimType</span>, on the other hand, determines
how the controller interprets the time value passed into the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> call. If the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">AnimType</span> is set to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">APP_TIME</span>, the time controller
will simply use the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span>
time (after applying the frequency and phase modifications) to
directly interpolate the state of the animation. On the other
hand, if the <span class="NDLSystemFont">AnimType</span> is set
to <span class="NDLSystemFont">APP_INIT</span>, the time
controller will use the modified <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> time to determine how long it has
been since <span class="NDLSystemFont">Start</span> has been
called and then use that local time to interpolate the state of
the animation.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAnimation</span> objects are
created automatically when exporting an animation from a modeling
package such as 3ds max or Maya. The exporter creates the
appropriate controllers according to the animation type: skeletal
animations are exported using <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTransformControllers</span>, morphs are
exported to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMorphWeightsControllers</span>, and so on.
These objects may also be created programmatically for simple
animations.</p>

<p>Most time controllers in Gamebryo contain an additional object
called an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiInterpolator.htm">NiInterpolator</a></span>. This class is
responsible for taking the time passed in by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiInterpController.htm">NiInterpController</a></span> (a
subclass of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTimeController</span>)
and determining the appropriate value for that time. This may
involve interpolating animation keys, solving constraints, or
some other algorithmic approach.</p>

<p>Sets of interpolators can be converted to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiEvaluator.htm">NiEvaluator</a></span>
objects during export from 3D modeling packages to form <a href=
"Animation_Sequences.htm">animation sequences</a>. Evaluators
perform a similar role as interpolators; however, evaluators are
more efficient for sequence animation. Gamebryo provides special
functionality to play back these sequences on in-game
characters.</p>

<p>Many <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiInterpController</span>
objects support one or more <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiInterpController.htm#UpdateValue">UpdateValue</a></span>
functions. These methods cause the controller to push a specified
value into the associated scene graph attribute. This particular
interface is utilized by the sequence-based character animation
system.</p>
