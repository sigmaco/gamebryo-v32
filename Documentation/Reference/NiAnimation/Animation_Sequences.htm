<h1>Animation Sequences</h1>

<p>Although animation can be created using various <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTimeController.htm">NiTimeController</a></span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiInterpolator.htm">NiInterpolator</a></span> 
 objects to drive individual scene graph attributes, it is often useful 
 to group these low level constructs into a higher level object representing 
 the animated sequence as a whole. This sequence can then be played on 
 a specific scene graph branch to animate an entire in-game character. 
 Gamebryo implements this concept via the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="NiSequenceData.htm">NiSequenceData</a></span> 
 class.</p>

<p>An <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> is 
 a collection of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="NiEvaluator.htm">NiEvaluator</a></span> 
 objects that describe a full animation on a character, such as a walk 
 or idle cycle. Evaluators perform a similar role as interpolators; however, 
 evaluators are more efficient for sequence animation. Sequences have common 
 begin and end times for all of their evaluators. Additionally, all evaluators 
 within a sequence share common timing information, such as frequency and 
 cycle type (loop or clamp). Not only does this shared timing information 
 allow it to be stored in a single place (in the sequence itself), but 
 it allows the scaled playback time (the update time modified by the timing 
 information) to be computed just once for all evaluators in the sequence, 
 which eliminates a number of calculations during execution.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects 
 are exported from 3ds max and Maya in the form of KF files. These can 
 be loaded from disk by an <a href="NiControllerManager.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span></a> or <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 HREF="NiActorManager.htm">NiActorManager</a></span> 
 (representing an in-game character or actor) for future playback on the 
 character's associated scene graph branch. As a memory optimization, a 
 given <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> can be shared by 
 multiple characters if they utilize the same 3D model. For example, the 
 baby lenguins in the <a HREF="../../Learn/FullDemos/Lenguins_on_Ice_Overview.htm">Lenguins 
 on Ice</a> demo share a single set of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> 
 objects since the babies are all cloned from a template actor. Unlike 
 interpolators, evaluators are completely shareable as they contain no 
 instance-based state for playing animations on a specific character. This 
 fact allows a given <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> to 
 be shared by multiple characters with minimal memory overhead. </p>

<p>An <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="NiControllerSequence.htm">NiControllerSequence</a></span> 
 object is temporarily created whenever an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> 
 is activated (i.e. played) on a character. This <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> 
 represents the active animation and is destroyed or <a href="NiControllerManager.htm#Sequence_Recycling">recycled</a> 
 shortly after the active sequence runs to completion. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> 
 manages an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiScratchPad.htm">NiScratchPad</a></span> 
 which stores any instance-based data required by the evaluators to play 
 the sequence on the given character. Many evaluators cache their current 
 animation curve segment in the scratch pad which allows the evaluators 
 to reuse this localized data across successive update times thereby increasing 
 runtime performance.</p>

<p>Each <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> 
 owns an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="NiPoseBuffer.htm">NiPoseBuffer</a></span> 
 to which the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> writes 
 its animated data for a given instant of time. Effectively, this pose 
 buffer contains a time-based snapshot (or pose) of the animated sequence. 
 Through the use of helper classes the controller manager propagates this 
 snapshot data to the appropriate scene graph targets which ultimately 
 results in an animated character. Additional information regarding the 
 flow of animation data from sequences to the scene graph can be found 
 in the <a HREF="NiControllerManager.htm">Overview</a> 
 section of the controller manager.</p>
