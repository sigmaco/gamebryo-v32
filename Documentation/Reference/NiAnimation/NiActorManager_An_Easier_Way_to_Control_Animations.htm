<h1>NiActorManager&mdash;An Easier Way to Control Animations</h1>

<p>Gamebryo provides two classes to control sequence-based
animation on in-game characters: <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiControllerManager.htm">NiControllerManager</a></span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiActorManager.htm">NiActorManager</a></span>. As described in
the <a href="NiControllerManager.htm">Overview of
NiControllerManager</a>, the controller manager provides the
ability to activate, deactivate, and blend sequences in a variety
of ways to produce smooth animation on a character. The
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> class builds
upon <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> to
provide the highest level of abstraction for controlling
character animations in Gamebryo. In particular, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> has additional support for
playing sequences on an in-game actor via a simple state machine
where each state represents a given animation sequence.
Transitions between sequences within the state machine are
defined via the <a href=
"../../Tools/animation_tool/Introduction_to_Animation_Tool.htm">Gamebryo
Animation Tool</a> and saved to disk as a KFM file. Applications
load the KFM file to create an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> representing the in-game
actor. Animations are activated on the actor by setting a target
sequence. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span>
handles the details of determining how to transition to the
target sequence based on the defined state machine. In addition
to a simpler programming interface, the use of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> allows an animator to fine
tune transitions between sequences using the Animation Tool with
minimal engineering support.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> has a more
sophisticated callback system than <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span>. In addition to
registering for callbacks on specific events which occur during
sequence playback, applications may query the actor manager for
the next time a particular event is predicted to occur. There are
five types of supported events: animation activated events,
animation deactivated events, animation completed events, end of
sequence events, and text key events. Animation completed events
are triggered when a sequence has completed its playback or been
aborted. This differs from the end of sequence event which
indicates the last frame of a possibly looping sequence has been
reached. One of the most useful event types is the text key
event, with which the occurrence of any specified text key can be
queried. One possible use of text key events is the placement of
text keys in an animation to indicate when the feet hit the
ground so that footstep sounds can be played.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The following describes a typical usage pattern for
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span>:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The <a href=
    "../../Tools/animation_tool/Introduction_to_Animation_Tool.htm">
    Animation Tool</a> is used to create a KFM file which
    specifies the actor manager's underlying resources. These
    resources include an NIF file containing the actor's 3D
    model, one or more KF files containing the actor's animation
    sequences, and details on how the animation state machine
    should transition between specific pairs of sequences. Each
    available sequence is assigned an integer ID to be used by
    the application when communicating with the actor manager.
    When the Animation Tool saves a KFM file it also generates a
    header file that contains a namespace and enumerations for
    all the actor's <a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Sequence_IDs">sequence IDs</a>. These
    enumerations are generated from the sequence names as defined
    in the Animation Tool, and are provided so that sequences can
    be specified in code without hard coding the actual sequence
    IDs.</li>

    <li>Create an actor manager in the application via
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Constructors">NiActorManager::Create</a></span>.
    This static function constructs an <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> using the specified KFM
    file. The function sets up the necessary animation state
    machine and transition information for the actor. Internally,
    the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> creates
    and initializes an <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> to handle most of
    the lower level details of playing animation sequences on the
    character. If requested, the NIF and KF files referenced by
    the KFM file will be loaded. KF files store animation
    sequences exported from 3ds max and Maya as <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiSequenceData.htm">NiSequenceData</a></span> objects. The
    mapping of sequence IDs to <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects may be modified
    at a later time as the game progresses using <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_change_sequences">NiActorManager::ChangeSequenceData</a></span>.
    Registered <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>
    objects can removed from the actor manager via <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_unload_sequences">UnloadSequenceData</a></span>.</li>

    <li>Add the actor's scene graph branch to the global scene
    graph representing the in-game world. The root node of the
    actor's scene graph branch (i.e. 3D model) can be obtained
    via <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_get_NIF_root">NiActorManager::GetNIFRoot</a></span>.
    Note this may differ from <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">GetActorRoot</span> which returns the target
    node of the internal <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span>.</li>

    <li>In the main loop which updates and renders the in-game
    world, call <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_update">NiActorManager::Update</a></span>
    on each in-game actor to update their internal state machines
    based on the current global game time. After all actors have
    been updated, call <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span>
    on the root of the global scene graph so each actor's
    internal <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> propagates its
    animated data to the scene graph.</li>

    <li>Although <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects were registered
    with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span>
    from the KFM file upon creation, the actor will remain static
    until one or more of these sequences are activated (i.e.
    played) by the application. Sequences can be activated via
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_set_target_animation">NiActorManager::SetTargetAnimation</a></span>
    using the sequence IDs assigned in the Animation Tool.
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> takes care
    of determining how to transition to the target sequence based
    on the defined state machine, and makes the appropriate calls
    to the internal <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span>. Upon sequence
    activation, Gamebryo creates an <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerSequence.htm">NiControllerSequence</a></span>
    which maintains instance-based state to play back the
    animated sequence on the given actor. This <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> represents the
    active animation and is destroyed or <a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Sequence_Recycling">recycled</a>
    shortly after the active sequence runs to completion. If
    needed, the state machine's active sequence can be accessed
    via <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_get_current_animation">NiActorManager::GetCurAnimation</a></span>
    and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_get_active_sequence">GetActiveSequence</a></span>.</li>

    <li>Sequences can be activated and deactivated separately
    from the internal state machine by calling <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_activate_sequences">NiActorManager::ActivateSequence</a></span>
    and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_deactivate_sequences">DeactivateSequence</a></span>.
    This feature is particularly useful for launching partial
    body animations to augment full body animations controlled by
    the state machine. For example, the state machine might loop
    a walk cycle as the in-game actor walks down a street. If the
    actor passes a neighbor on the street, <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ActivateSequence</span> can be used to
    trigger a higher priority wave sequence so the actor waves
    while walking.</li>

    <li>Events are registered and unregistered using <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_register_callbacks">NiActorManager::RegisterCallback</a></span>
    and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_unregister_callbacks">UnregisterCallback</a></span>.
    Sequences activated by the state machine as well as the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">ActivateSequence</span> function
    receive callbacks for registered events. Applications which
    hold onto <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects (i.e.
    active sequences) via smart pointers should register for the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Event_Types">ANIM_COMPLETED</a></span>
    event type which signals when a held object should be
    released.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_get_next_event_time">NiActorManager::GetNextEventTime</a></span>
    is used to query the actor manager for when a specific event
    is scheduled to occur next. <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> maintains an internal
    timeline of sequence-based events which often allows it to
    predict their next occurrence.</li>

    <li><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Sequence_Recycling">Sequence
    recycling</a> can be controlled through the use of
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_recycling_sequences">NiControllerManager::SetMaxRecycledSequences</a></span>.
    Applications may call <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_get_controller_manager">NiActorManager::GetControllerManager</a></span>
    to access the actor's controller manager. Sequence recycling
    is enabled by default on each character to improve runtime
    performance and minimize memory fragmentation at the expense
    of a slightly larger memory footprint.</li>

    <li>To shut down an actor, deactivate all active sequences
    via <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiActorManager.htm#Functions_to_reset">NiActorManager::Reset</a></span>,
    and remove the actor's scene graph branch from the global
    scene graph. Actor related objects such as <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span>, <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span>, <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>, and the actor's
    scene graph branch will be destroyed automatically when the
    application releases its last held reference on these
    objects.</li>
