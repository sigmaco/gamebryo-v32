<h1>Overview of NiControllerManager</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>An <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiControllerManager.htm">NiControllerManager</a></span> controls
<a href="Animation_Sequences.htm">animation sequences</a> on a
specific "character" or branch of the scene graph. As such, it
provides the ability to activate, deactivate, and blend sequences
in a variety of ways to produce smooth animation on the
character. <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiSequenceData.htm">NiSequenceData</a></span> objects, stored in
KF files, are added to the controller manager for future playback
of the contained animation sequences. An <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiControllerSequence.htm">NiControllerSequence</a></span> is
temporarily created upon activation (i.e. playback) of a
registered <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>.
This <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>
represents the active animation on the character and is destroyed
or <a href=
"NiControllerManager.htm#Sequence_Recycling">recycled</a> shortly
after the active sequence runs to completion.</p>

<p>Each <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>
owns an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiPoseBuffer.htm">NiPoseBuffer</a></span> to which the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> writes
its animated data for a given instant of time. Effectively, this
pose buffer contains a time-based snapshot (or pose) of the
animated sequence. Through the use of helper classes the
controller manager propagates this snapshot data to the
appropriate scene graph targets, which ultimately results in an
animated character. When multiple sequences are simultaneously
active on the character the controller manager blends the data
from each pose buffer before distributing the final result to the
scene graph.</p>

<p>In addition to activating and deactivating sequences, the
controller manager provides a number of mechanisms to trigger
smooth transitions from one sequence to another. In short, the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> provides a
high level interface for sequence-based character animation. The
controller manager and its helper classes handle the low level
details of time controllers, key data, evaluators, scratch pad
entries, scene graph attributes, and other animation-based
entities. This abstraction allows an application to deal with
animations at the relatively high level of playing sequences at
the appropriate times on each in-game character.</p>

<p>That said, the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiActorManager.htm">NiActorManager</a></span> class builds upon
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> to provide
the highest level of abstraction within Gamebryo for controlling
sequences on characters. In particular, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> has additional support for
playing sequences on an in-game actor via a simple state machine.
Transitions between sequences in the state machine are defined
via the <a href=
"../../Tools/animation_tool/Introduction_to_Animation_Tool.htm">Gamebryo
Animation Tool</a>. Since <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> provides a higher level
interface than <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> many developers find
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> is an easier
starting point for animating actors in their application. See the
<a href=
"NiActorManager_An_Easier_Way_to_Control_Animations.htm">NiActorManager
Overview</a> for more details.</p>

<a name="Helper_Classes" id="Helper_Classes"></a><h2>Helper Classes</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span>
makes use of several helper classes to play back animation
sequences including <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiPoseBinding.htm">NiPoseBinding</a></span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiPoseBlender.htm">NiPoseBlender</a></span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiMultiTargetPoseHandler.htm">NiMultiTargetPoseHandler</a></span>.
Since the controller manager primarily works with these classes
behind the scenes most applications should have minimal
interaction with these helper objects. Nonetheless, it can be
beneficial to understand how the underlying system works.</p>

<p>An <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span> is
assigned to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> upon the manager's
construction. This <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span> assists with mapping (i.e.
binding) sequence evaluator channels to specific data locations
within <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBuffer</span> objects.
Each active sequence (i.e. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>) has an associated
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBuffer</span> to which the
sequence writes its sampled evaluator data for a given update
time. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span>
determines where each piece of data is written. For example, an
evaluator channel that drives the rotation of an elbow joint
might be bound to the fifth quaternion in the pose buffer. Once
bound to this specific location, all active sequences on the
character will write their elbow rotation value to the fifth
quaternion in their associated pose buffer. New bindings are
added to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span>
whenever an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>
containing previously unbound evaluator channels is loaded by the
controller manager.</p>

<p>There must be a unique <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span> for each unique character
template in an application; however, characters utilizing
identical 3D models and associated sets of animation sequences
may share a single <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span> as a memory and performance
optimization. For example, the baby lenguins in the <a href=
"../../Learn/FullDemos/Lenguins_on_Ice_Overview.htm">Lenguins on
Ice demo</a> reuse a single <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span> since they are all clones of
a template actor. On the other hand, the lenguin momma has a
separate <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span> since
this actor uses a different 3D model as well as a different set
of sequences than the babies.</p>

<p>When multiple sequences are active on a given character the
controller manager makes use of an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBlender</span> to blend the data contained
in each sequence's pose buffer. The uniform mapping provided by
the manager's <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span>
allows these sequence-based snapshots to be quickly blended based
the priority and weight values of each active sequence. The
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBlender</span> writes the final
blended data to a separate <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBuffer</span> which is returned to the
controller manager so the contained data may be distributed to
the appropriate scene graph targets. See this <a href=
"Animation_Blending_Overview.htm#Overview_of_Sequence_Blending">section</a>
in Animation Basics for information regarding sequence
blending.</p>

<p>The controller manager utilizes an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMultiTargetPoseHandler</span> to propagate pose
buffer data to their targeted interp controllers and scene graph
nodes. For all practical purposes the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMultiTargetPoseHandler</span> has become the
scene graph interface for the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span>. During its
initialization the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMultiTargetPoseHandler</span> builds an
internal array which associates pose buffer locations, as defined
by the manager's <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span>, with their target scene
graph objects. This array is updated in conjunction with the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span> as <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects containing
previously unbound evaluator channels are loaded by the
controller manager. As an optimization, transform data items are
bound directly to their target transform nodes. The remaining
data items are bound to their target interp controllers.</p>

<p>In addition to mapping pose buffer locations to target
objects, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMultiTargetPoseHandler</span> maintains a
transform value for the accumulation root when <a href=
"NiControllerManager.htm#Transformation_Accumulation">transformation
accumulation</a> is enabled on the character. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMultiTargetPoseHandler</span> is responsible
for updating the accumulation transform node as animation
sequences are played.</p>

<h2>Helper Classes</h2>

<p>Although <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiControllerManager.htm">NiControllerManager</a></span> is
derived from <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTimeController.htm">NiTimeController</a></span>,
it does not utilize much of the base class interface. A typical
application controls in-game characters via <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> in the following
manner:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Load (or create) a scene graph branch representing the
    in-game character. 3D models are exported from 3ds max or
    Maya as Gamebryo NIF files. Refer to <a href=
    "../../Programmer/General_Topics/Loading_NIF_Files.htm">Loading
    NIF Files</a> for additional information.</li>

    <li>Create an <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> by specifying the
    character's scene graph branch via the first parameter in the
    <a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Constructors">constructor</a>.
    Specify true for the second parameter if the character should
    <a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Transformation_Accumulation">accumulate
    transformations</a> on its accum root node.</li>

    <li>Register one or more animation sequences with the
    character via the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> loading methods
    such as <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_adding_sequences">AddSequenceDataFromFile</a></span>
    or <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_adding_sequences">AddAllSequenceDatasFromFile</a></span>.
    These functions load <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiSequenceData.htm">NiSequenceData</a></span> objects from
    KF files, which are exported from 3ds max and Maya by the
    <a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Controller_Extractor.htm">Controller
    Extractor plug-in</a>. Additional <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects may be added to
    the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> at
    a later time as the game progresses. Registered <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects can removed
    from the controller manager to reduce memory usage via
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_removing_sequences">RemoveSequenceData</a></span>.</li>

    <li>Add the character's scene graph branch to the global
    scene graph representing the in-game world.</li>

    <li>In the main loop which updates and renders the in-game
    world, call <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> on the
    root of the global scene graph using the global game time.
    Since the character's scene graph branch was added to the
    global scene graph the controller manager's <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Update</span> method will automatically be
    called during each scene graph traversal. This function
    causes the evaluators within each active sequence on the
    character to write their latest values to the pose buffer,
    blends this data when multiple sequences are active,
    propagates the composite result to the appropriate scene
    graph targets, and shuts down any active sequences which have
    now completed. In essence, the character's scene graph is
    updated to reflect the latest animation state.</li>

    <li>Although <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects have been
    registered with the character, the character will remain
    static until one or more of these sequences are activated by
    the application. <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_activating_sequences">NiControllerManager::ActivateSequence</a></span>
    should be called to activate (i.e. play) a sequence on the
    character. Once activated, the sequence will continue to play
    until deactivated via <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_deactivating_sequences">
    DeactivateSequence</a></span>.</li>

    <li>After a sequence is actively playing the controller
    manager can be used to smoothly transition the character to
    another sequence. These functions include <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_cross_fading_two_sequences">
    CrossFade</a></span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_blend_transitions">BlendFromSequence</a></span>,
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_morph_transitions">Morph</a></span>,
    and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Alternate_functions_for_blend_transitions">
    BlendFromPose</a></span>.</li>

    <li>The activation and transition functions in <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> return a pointer
    to the newly created <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerSequence.htm">NiControllerSequence</a></span>,
    which represents the active animation. If needed, the
    application can hold onto this object via a smart pointer or
    similar reference counting mechanism. This technique provides
    the application the ability to query and adjust the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> as
    required. As described next, the application should register
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiSequenceData.htm#Callback_Objects">ActivationCallback</a></span>
    objects to determine when it should release a held
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>
    object.</li>

    <li>The application can register for activation events on
    specific sequences via <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerSequence.htm#Functions_related_to_callback_objects">
    NiControllerSequence::AddActivationCallback</a></span> and
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiSequenceData.htm#Functions_related_to_callback_objects">NiSequenceData::AddDefaultActivationCallback</a></span>.
    The first method adds a callback object to a specific
    sequence that is already playing. The second function is
    likely more useful as it sets up a callback object each time
    a sequence is activated on a specified character or
    optionally any character. The <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiSequenceData.htm#Callback_Objects">ActivationChanged</a></span>
    method on the callback object is executed whenever the
    associated <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> object is
    activated, reactivated, or deactivated. This is particularly
    useful when an application holds references to <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects. These
    references should be released when the callback signals that
    the sequence has entered the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerSequence.htm#NiAnimState">INACTIVE</a></span>
    state, meaning the sequence no longer affects the
    character.</li>

    <li>Applications which utilize transformation accumulation
    might need to set the accumulation transform for the
    character from time to time. This can be accomplished via
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_relating_to_transformation_accumulation">
    NiControllerManager::SetAccumulatedTransform</a></span>.</li>

    <li>To shut down a character halt all active sequences, and
    remove the character's scene graph branch from the global
    scene graph. Character related objects such as <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span>, <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>, and the
    character's scene graph branch will be destroyed
    automatically when the application releases its last held
    reference on these objects. <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_removing_actively_playing_sequences">
    NiControllerManager::RemoveAllSequences</a></span> can be
    used to remove all <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects from the
    character. Similarly, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_removing_sequences">RemoveAllSequenceDatas</a></span>
    will unregister all its <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects. Shutting down
    a character will be slightly faster if <a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Sequence_Recycling">sequence
    recycling</a> is disabled on the character before calling
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">RemoveAllSequences</span>.</li>

    <li><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Sequence_Recycling">Sequence
    recycling</a> can be controlled through the use of
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Functions_for_recycling_sequences">NiControllerManager::SetMaxRecycledSequences</a></span>.
    Sequence recycling is enabled by default on each character to
    improve runtime performance and minimize memory fragmentation
    at the expense of a slightly larger memory footprint.</li>

    <li>As described above in the <a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm#Helper_Classes">Helper Classes</a>
    section, new bindings are added to the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiPoseBinding.htm">NiPoseBinding</a></span> whenever an
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiSequenceData.htm">NiSequenceData</a></span> containing
    previously unbound evaluator channels is loaded by an
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "NiControllerManager.htm">NiControllerManager</a></span>. The
    following technique is an optimization which ensures these
    bindings are fully defined before an application enters its
    main gameplay loop. Export an <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> from 3ds max or Maya
    which contains every possible animated channel for the given
    character. To save space this sequence may be a pose (i.e. a
    single frame of animation). Load this sequence on the
    character before the application enters its main gameplay
    loop. This operation forces the associated <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiPoseBinding</span> to create bindings for
    all channels in this sequence. If this sequence contains
    channels for every animated attribute in the character, the
    bindings will be fully defined. If additional <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects are
    subsequently loaded by the character, even during gameplay,
    no additional bindings will be created for the character
    since they already exist. If the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> containing every
    animatable attribute will never be activated during gameplay,
    it can be removed from the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> without impacting
    the character's bindings to save a little memory.</li>
