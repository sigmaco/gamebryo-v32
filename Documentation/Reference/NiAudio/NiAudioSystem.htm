<h1>NiAudioSystem</h1>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiAudioSystem_Class_Reference.htm">NiAudioSystem</a></span> is the core
component for audio playback in a Gamebryo application.</p>

<p>Only a single instance of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAudioSystem</span> class is needed in
any Gamebryo application using the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAudio</span> library. This
instance is constructed automatically upon application startup
and is destroyed automatically upon application shutdown. The
class provides methods for starting and closing the audio system
at run-time. It also includes methods to start and stop playback
of all audio sources, obtain a reference to the audio system's
listener object, and update the audio system. The audio system is
typically updated every frame of an application during the
rendering loop, and must be updated in order to ensure that
spatialized audio sources and animated volume levels are
reflected in the sounded output.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAudioSystem</span> is also a factory
for creating new <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiAudioSource_Class_Reference.htm">NiAudioSource</a></span>s. Using the factory
allow the application to create sound-implementation-specific
sources but still use the system in an abstract way.</p>

<h2>Miles-Specific Implementation</h2>

<p>During initialization of the <a href=
"NiMilesAudioSystem.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMilesAudioSystem</span></a>, you'll need to
provide a directory path to the Miles run time files. Also on
Win32, you'll need to ensure that mss32.dll is accessible to the
executable.</p>

<p>Depending on what driver you are using, different capabilities
will be available. The maximum number of sounds that can be
played simultaneously is dependent on the driver.</p>

<p>Miles will not properly run without its redistribution files,
so setting the path to the runtime files is very important.
Typically, Gamebryo samples will place the redistribution files
in a Miles directory along with the other application data. The
Data directory typically contains NIF files, textures, and
animation data.</p>
