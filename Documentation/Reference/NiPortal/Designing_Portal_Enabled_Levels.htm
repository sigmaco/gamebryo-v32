<h1>Designing Portal-Enabled Levels</h1>

<h2>Room and Wall Strategies</h2>

<p>There are several steps in designing a portal-enabled
data-set. The first step is to determine how to break the
overall scene into rooms or cells. Each room must be divided up
into convex regions with one <a href="NiRoom.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRoom</span></a> object associated with each
region, defined by planar <a href=
"NiRoom.htm#NiRoom__Wall"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRoom::Wall</span></a> objects.</p>

<div class="NDLFigureContainer">
    <img src="images/image002_01.gif" width="410" height="162"
    alt="image002_01 (7K)">
</div>

<p>The <a href="NiRoom.htm#NiRoom__Wall"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRoom::Wall</span></a> objects that determine
the shape of the room are not visible geometry (i.e. they are
marked as hidden or invisible geometry in a commercial 3D
modeler). The walls serve only as infinite planes to bound the
space around the room - see the illustration above for an
example. An entire room need not be partitioned into individual
walls.</p>

<p><a href="NiRoom.htm#NiRoom__Wall"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRoom::Wall</span></a> objects are only used to
determine which room contains the viewer. As a result, only
enough walls as are needed to uniquely determine the room
containing a camera are required. An example of this is a
one-floor house. In this case, the vertical walls uniquely
determine the room containing a point. As a result, it is not
necessary to add the floors and ceilings of each room to the set
of walls for the room. However, note that the "shell" object (the
level as viewed from the outside) is only drawn if the camera is
not inside any room as defined by its planes. Levels that require
the use of the shell (for example a house that the camera is
allowed to exit and view from the exterior) should ensure that
all <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiRoom.htm">NiRoom</a></span> objects in the level are tightly
bounded by <a href="NiRoom.htm#NiRoom__Wall"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRoom::Wall</span></a> objects.</p>

<p>Note that the convex spaces defining <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiRoom.htm">NiRoom</a></span> objects
must not overlap each other this may sometimes require rooms to
be subdivided to a slightly finer grain than one might otherwise
desire, but this is generally not excessive.</p>

<h2>Portal Strategies</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiPortal.htm">NiPortal</a></span> objects sometimes do not
exactly match the doorways that they represent they are sometimes
simple bounding polygons for the doorways. This can lead to some
overdraw (as the portals do not cull to the exact doorway), but
can increase performance by lowering the number of portal polygon
vertices that have to be processed during culling. An example of
a simple portal polygon for a complex doorway is shown below.</p>

<div class="NDLFigureContainer">
    <img src="images/image004.gif" width="206" height="197" alt=
    "image004 (5K)">
</div>

<h3>Adjacent Rooms Connected by Multiple Doorways</h3>

<p>In a naive system, multiple portals connecting two rooms can
lead to a performance issue. In particular, if the camera is in
room A and two portals leading to room B are visible, room B is
drawn twice, once per portal. Gamebryo eliminates this overdraw
via its culling process. In Gamebryo, room B is visited through
each portal, but only for the purposes of determining which
fixtures in the room are potentially visible. A unique list of
objects is maintained and each object in the list is drawn once.
The multiple visits for culling come at some cost, but not as
much cost as multiple renderings of the room. To avoid even this
cost, you will want multiple portals into the same room to be
separated enough so that only one is visible at a time.</p>

<p>The openings through which the viewer can see might be
separated by only a thin piece of opaque geometry, such a wall
made up mostly of windows. In such cases it is preferable to use
a single portal that encloses all of the windows, because the
small cost of excess overdraw is less than the cost of processing
several portals.</p>

<h2>Overall Portal Architectures</h2>

<p>As a note, most applications use portals for basic culling
assistance at a gross scale. As a result, they do not take the
room/wall/portal paradigm to the extreme. Taken to the logical
extreme, every physical wall in the data-set would be represented
by at least one <a href="NiRoom.htm#NiRoom__Wall"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRoom::Wall</span></a>, and every window or
doorway would be represented by an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiPortal.htm">NiPortal</a></span> that
matches it exactly in terms of shape and size.</p>

<p>Real-world portal data-sets do not typically lend themselves
to this extreme, using portals more or less strictly, depending
on the particular need for geometry culling. For example, an
artist may or may not break every room into convex subsections.
Instead, (possibly non-convex) sections of the data-set are
bounded by simple, convex polyhedra (often boxes), which form the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiRoom.htm">NiRoom</a></span>s of the data-set.</p>

<p>An example of a 3ds max file that includes a data-set that is
tagged for portals is <em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Samples\Models\Max
Artist Examples\Portal Rooms.max. When the data-set is viewed or
exported from 3ds max, the user will be presented with a
collection of rooms that are portal-enabled using the strategies
outlined above.</p>
