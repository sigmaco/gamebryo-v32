<h1>Rooms</h1>

<p>In the visibility graphs described above, rooms (<span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiRoom.htm">NiRoom</a> 
 </span>objects) form the &quot;nodes&quot; of the graph (the cells). A 
 room represents a subset of the interior scene that is defined by a set 
 of infinite planes (the <a HREF="NiRoom.htm#NiRoom__Wall">NiRoom::Wall</a> 
 objects). As a result, a room represents a convex subset of 3-space.</p>

<p>Rooms contain three components: Walls, fixtures, and 
 portals. Walls are instances of the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiRoom.htm#NiRoom__Wall">NiRoom::Wall</a></span> 
 class and represent planes that bound the room. Fixtures represent any 
 piece of rendered geometry for the room, including the geometry of the 
 room's ceiling, floor, walls and furniture. Finally, portals represent 
 ways of seeing out of a room into other rooms.</p>

<p>The fact that <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiRoom.htm">NiRoom</a> </span>objects 
 represent convex sets is helpful to the rendering algorithm. It means 
 that it is very easy to determine which room contains the current camera, 
 via simple plane tests involving the walls in the room.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the fact that the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiPortal.htm">NiPortal</a> </span>objects 
 represent ways of seeing from a given room to any others that can be seen 
 from the room is very important. This ensures that when processing the 
 rooms that adjoin the one containing the viewer, the geometry can be culled 
 to the boundary of the doorway, further ensuring a limited amount of pixel 
 overwrite and&nbsp;processing of obscured geometry.</p>

<p>As can be seen, convex rooms are the heart of the&nbsp;culling 
 process for an interior scene. <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiRoom.htm">NiRoom</a> </span>objects 
 implement the recursive traversal of the interior scene graph to&nbsp;process 
 it (basically) back-to-front (although the actual culling of geometry 
 to doorways is handled by <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiPortal.htm">NiPortal</a></span> objects). 
 The basic algorithm for&nbsp;processing a convex room is as follows:</p>
 
<pre>
if the current room is being visited
    then return to calling room
else
    mark the current room as being visited
    for each portal in the room
        test the portal against the current view rectangle
        if the portal is visible
            then clip the view rectangle to bound the portal
                and recursively process the adjoining room
    endfor
    process the current room's fixtures
    mark the current room as not being visited
    return to calling room
</pre>
