<h1>Room Groups</h1>

<p>A visibility graph is the high-level representation of an
interior scene in the portals module. This visibility graph
describes the "topology" of the rooms within the scene. If drawn
as a graph, nodes of the graph are the rooms and the edges
(directed) are the portals. This represents the idea that the
only way of seeing out of a room (and into another) is through a
doorway, window, or opening in the wall of the room.</p>

<p>The entire interior scene is represented in Gamebryo with an
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRoomGroup</span> object. This room
group manages the rooms in its interior scene, and "directs" the
culling of the rooms. Its main purpose is to start the culling of
the graph of rooms from the correct room. In this case, the
correct room is the room (if any) that contains the current
camera location. When a room group is tested for visibility, it
determines the room (if any) that contains the camera, and
recursively processes that room. If no room contains the camera's
location, then the room group assumes that the camera is
currently located outside the interior scene, and processes the
"shell" or exterior representation of the scene, if one is
supplied. If there is no shell and the camera does not fall
within a room in the room group, then the room that most recently
contained the camera is used.</p>
