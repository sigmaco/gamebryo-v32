<p class="NDLRefHead1">Description</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPortal</span> objects are
grouping nodes that support aggressive visibility culling. They
represent flat polygonal regions through which a part of a scene
graph can be viewed. In other words, portals represent doorways
and windows in a scene, as well as the objects seen through such
openings.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Constructors</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">NiPortal(unsigned short
usVertices, const <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPoint3.htm">NiPoint3</a>* pkVertex,
<a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a>*
pkAdjoiner = 0, bool bActive = true)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Member-wise constructor. The
first parameter, <span class="NDLSystemFont">usVertices</span>,
is the number of vertices defining the portal's polygon.
<span class="NDLSystemFont">pkVertex</span> is a pointer to an
array of model-space portal polygon vertices. This vertex array
data is copied, not used directly. As a result, the array passed
in may be destroyed immediately following the construction of the
portal. <span class="NDLSystemFont">pkAdjoiner</span> is a
pointer to the scene graph that is to be seen through the portal
(this may be <span class="NDLSystemFont">NULL</span> if the
adjoiner has not yet been created). <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">bActive</span> is the initial value of the
portal's active flag (<span class="NDLSystemFont">false</span> if
the portal is to be disabled). The active flag allows portals to
be turned on or off ("closed" or "opened" in door terms).</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Supported Member Functions</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction"><a href=

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void SetAdjoiner(<a href=

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Retrieve and set the adjoiner
object, which is the root of the scene graph that is to be seen
through the portal. See the notes below for information regarding
the behavior of the adjoiner.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">bool GetActive() const</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void SetActive(bool bActive)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Retrieve and set the active
flag for the portal. The portal is "closed" when this flag is set
to <span class="NDLSystemFont">false</span> and the adjoiner is
not drawn, even if the portal is in view.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">unsigned short GetVertexCount()

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Returns the number of vertices
in the portal polygon.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">const <a href=

const</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Returns the array of
model-space vertices that define the portal polygon. The
non-const version allows the application to manipulate the shape
of the portal at runtime. See the "Notes" below for issues
surrounding the real-time modification of portal polygons.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction"><a href=

GetModelBound()</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void SetModelBound(const <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiBound.htm">NiBound</a>&amp; kBound)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Retrieve and set the model
bound of the portal. Note that the model bound of a portal need
only bound the vertices of portal polygon, not the subtree that
forms the adjoiner. This is true because it is the portal polygon
that is used to cull the portal, not the adjoining geometry.
Furthermore, this explains much of the power of portals&mdash;a
potentially large scene graph can be culled aggressively if there
is only a small window or doorway connecting the viewer and the
large scene.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Notes</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Portal Adjoiners</p>

<p>The relationship between portal and adjoiner is <em>not</em> a
parent-child relationship&mdash;it is only a culling
relationship. As a result, the adjoiner inherits no transforms,
properties or effects from the portal. In most cases in Gamebryo
scene graphs, the adjoiner to an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPortal</span> object is an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiRoom.htm">NiRoom</a></span> object.
Furthermore, Update calls that traverse an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPortal</span> object are <em>not</em> passed on
to the adjoiner, since the relationship is not one of
parent-child. Note that portals are one-way only. A portal
represents a way of seeing from the portal's parent scene graph
into the adjoiner scene graph. The reverse is not implied by a
single portal. A two-way window or doorway (i.e. anything that is
not a one-way mirror) requires two independent portals.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Portal Polygon Shape</p>

<p>Portal polygons are not required to be convex. Vertices may be
repeated or collinear. Applications should avoid including a
large number of interior points as a part of the portal polygon,
however, as each point in a portal polygon does incur some cost
each time the portal is processed.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Runtime Modification of Portal
Polygons</p>

<p>Portal polygon model-space vertices may be changed at runtime
as desired by the application, but the application must follow a
procedure very similar to that used to modify vertices of an
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderObject.htm">NiRenderObject</a></span>
object. First, the model-space bound must be updated to bound the
portal polygon (not the entire adjoiner) either by setting the
model bound's need update flag to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">true</span>, or by updating the model bound
directly to bound the polygon. Then, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> must be called upon the portal or
one of its ancestors.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Cloning</p>

<p>Cloning is not supported in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPortal</span> class. The definition of cloning
in this context is somewhat undefined. Unlike a traditional scene
graph, a portal-enabled scene graph may contain cycles, so
resolving how to clone the portals and rooms is not
straightforward. Therefore the Gamebryo <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Clone</span> operation will not work with a
data-set containing any <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPortal</span> library objects. Applications
that need to duplicate portal-enabled data-sets should use
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiObject.htm">NiObject</a>::CreateDeepCopy</span>,
which relies on the streaming system rather than the cloning
system.</p>
