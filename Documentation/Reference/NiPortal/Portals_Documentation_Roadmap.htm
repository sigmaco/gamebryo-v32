<h1>Portals Documentation Roadmap</h1>

<p>The "Portal Basics" chapter describes the use of the Gamebryo
portals or "room-to-room visibility system". The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPortal</span> library of the Gamebryo game
engine is the implementation of the portal visibility system. The
remaining sections in this chapter describe the portal visibility
system at a high level including what such a system is designed
to do, what it cannot do, what the components are, and how they
are assembled into an efficient system. These sections are
designed mainly for developers, but artists should read them as
well, to gain an understanding of how the objects defined by the
portals system interact.</p>

<p>The chapter "<a href=
"Overview_of_Portal_Scene_Strategies_and_Tricks.htm">Portal Scene
Strategies and Performance</a>" describes several optimization
techniques and tricks that an application developer may use to
increase the performance of games using portal-based scene
graphs.</p>

<p>The chapter "<a href="NiPortal.htm">Portals Class
Reference</a>" is the reference manual, describing all of the
classes defined by the portals module.</p>

<p>Naturally, 3D modeling packages will benefit from tools that
assist the artist in creating portal-enabled levels. Gamebryo has
a tool called the <a href=
"../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Portal_Converter.htm">Portal
Converter</a> whose functionality is exposed by plug-ins for 3ds
max and Maya. The tool plug-ins allow artists to create these
levels and walk through them (to see how effectively the portals
cull the dataset) without having to leave their modeling tool.
The converter documentation also discusses dataset decomposition
(into the component parts required for portals) from a more
artistic point of view. The documentation is written for artists
familiar with 3ds max, but developers should also consider
reading it to understand common methods of breaking datasets into
portal-enabled levels. Although Maya exposes functionality for
the same converter, the user interface is slightly different. The
details for this modeling package are located in <a href=
"../../Art/Maya/Portals_with_Maya.htm">Portals with Maya</a>.</p>
