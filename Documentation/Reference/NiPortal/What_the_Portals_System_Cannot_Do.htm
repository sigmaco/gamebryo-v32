<h1>What the Portals System Cannot Do</h1>

<p>The portals system is not an off-line Potential Visible Set
(PVS) system, which automatically determines potentially visible
parts of a scene at a coarse level. The Gamebryo portals library
does not have an off-line visibility tool. Developers are assumed
to have organized the scene according to the guidelines set forth
in other parts of the portal system documentation, and have
connected rooms by portals. Having done this, the visible subset
of the scene can be computed efficiently each frame at runtime.
Unlike a static PVS system, the Gamebryo portals system can be
used with scenes that are not pre-built&mdash;advanced
applications can actually build or load the scene on the fly,
adding and removing rooms and doorways as needed.</p>

<p>The Gamebryo portals library does not require a standalone
level-editor application or PVS compiler that artists must use to
layout game levels. Artists can create portal-based "levels" in
the modeling packages with which they are comfortable and view
and export them as portal-enabled scenes with the Gamebryo 3ds
max or Maya Plug-ins.</p>

<p>Gamebryo's portal system does not perform automatic occlusion
culling, in which a large object or the combination of several
objects are used to avoid considering objects hidden behind. This
means that outdoor scenes, or scenes in which objects are hidden
through the combination of many smaller objects (like trees in a
forest), are poorly suited to the cell portal system.
Applications should employ customized techniques to handle such
situations.</p>
