<h1>Introduction to NiMeshProfileProcessor</h1>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileProcessor</span> 
 library is an internal use only library. The primary function of <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileProcessor</span> 
 is to maintain and operate runtime profiles which specify how data-streams 
 are to be processed at the end of the tool plug-in pipeline (see <a href="../../Art/Other/Introduction_to_the_Gamebryo_Tool_Plug_in_Framework.htm">Introduction 
 to the Tool Plug-in Framework</a>). Those same profiles can, not only 
 specify how the data is processed, but also how semantic elements are 
 interleaved together. The library is utilized by the Gamebryo 
 Maya exporter in conjunction with the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../Tool_Plug_ins/Mesh_Finalize.htm">MeshFinalize</a></span> 
 plug-in. The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Tools/Tool_Plug_in_Batch_Tool/Tool_Plug_in_Batch_Tool_Intro.htm">ToolPluginBatch</a></span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Tools/Tool_Plug_in_Testbed/Introduction_to_the_Gamebryo_Tool_Plug_in_Testbed.htm">ToolPluginTestbed</a></span> 
 developer tools also make use of the library. </p>

<a name=NiMeshProfileProcessor_Internals></a><h2>NiMeshProfileProcessor Internals</h2>

<p>In general, the specifics to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileProcessor</span> 
 library need not concern developers, however, in the event that developers 
 find themselves writing plug-ins for their export process, or creating 
 new modifiers, or even writing new XML profiles (see <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../NiMeshProfileXMLParser/Introduction_to_NiMeshProfileXMLParser.htm">NiMeshProfileXMLParser</a></span>), 
 understanding some basics of the internal workings of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileProcessor</span> 
 may be helpful.</p>

<p>To begin, the library consists of a singleton of the 
 same name. Exporters and other tools typically begin by initializing the 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileProcessor</span> 
 singleton followed by registering runtime profile objects (<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiOpProfile</span>) 
 with the system. How those profiles are created does not concern the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileProcessor</span> 
 library, though it should be noted that the Maya exporter and aforementioned 
 developer tools use the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMeshProfileXMLParser/Introduction_to_NiMeshProfileXMLParser.htm">NiMeshProfileXMLParser</a></span> 
 to generate profiles from XML. When the exporter or tool shuts down, that 
 application is responsible for shutting down the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileProcessor</span> 
 singleton. </p>

<p>The actual profiles (<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiOpProfile</span> 
 objects) maintained by <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileProcessor</span> 
 are treated as static and are accessible at any point during the plug-in 
 pipeline. This allows individual mesh objects to refer to the same profile. 
 The way by which a mesh actually refers to a profile is by attaching an 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMain/NiStringExtraData.htm">NiStringExtraData</a></span> 
 object to the mesh. The string extra data must have the name "<span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">MeshProfileName</span>" 
 and the value of that extra data should specify the name of the profile 
 that is to be applied. Since all profiles are static and potentially shared 
 by other mesh, plug-ins should not take liberties to modify them.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileProcessor</span> 
 library provides the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Finalize</span> method 
 for manipulating data streams in the scene (this method, incidentally, 
 is what the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../Tool_Plug_ins/Mesh_Finalize.htm">MeshFinalize</a></span> 
 plug-in wraps). Each mesh in the scene is processed using the specified 
 mesh profile. Processing entails conversions of data-stream elements from 
 one format to another, renaming semantics, modifying access and usage 
 types, merging and swizzing element components, and the like. The <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">Finalize</span> method also attempts to accommodate 
 mesh modifier requirements by making adjustments to the profile (see"<a href="#Merging_Mesh_Modifier_Requirements_into_Profiles">Merging 
 Mesh Modifier Requirements into Profiles</a>"). Lastly, the 
 method will attempt to interleave semantic elements (as specified by the 
 mesh profile) into single data-streams. </p>

<p>To facilitate the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Finalize</span> 
 method, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiOpProfile</span> 
 contains distinct instructions which are linked together via various derived 
 operation nodes (<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiOpNodes</span>). 
 The operation nodes are really nothing more than thin wrappers around 
 a set of static functions that allow for processing and manipulation of 
 data streams in interesting and unique ways. By having these thin wrapper 
 nodes, profiles can chain together operations in any order and with any 
 degree of complexity that they desire. In practice, the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../NiMeshProfileXMLParser/Introduction_to_NiMeshProfileXMLParser.htm">NiMeshProfileXMLParser</a></span>, 
 ensures a fairly set order of operations. These operations are described 
 briefly in the "Mesh Profile Operations" section.</p>

<a name=Anatomy_of_a_Runttime_Mesh_Profile></a><h2>Anatomy of a Runtime Mesh Profile</h2>

<p>The important components contained by a runtime mesh 
 profile are:</p>

<h3>Name</h3>

<p>Each profile has an associated name that must be unique 
 (per-renderer target). The name is not only what is displayed to tools 
 and exporters, but is also used to match the attached name-extra from 
 the mesh to select the appropriate profile.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Each profile has a short description which is intended 
 to be used by the tool or exporter for display purposes.</p>

<h3>Renderer</h3>

<p>A runtime profile may only be associated with a specific 
 renderer. (An XML representation of a profile, on the other hand, may 
 allow overlaying renderer differences). For a given renderer, there can 
 only be one profile of a given "name". Because of hardware differences, 
 having per-renderer profiles is useful.</p>

<h3>Start and Terminating Operation Nodes</h3>

<p>The key component of a Mesh Profile is how it instructs 
 the system to manipulate data streams. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileProcessor</span> 
 provides a number of data stream operations that a Mesh Profile can chained 
 together via various operation <em>nodes</em>. 
 Operation nodes are really nothing more than thin wrappers around operations 
 with the additional benefits of allowing parameters to be set in advance 
 and providing the ability for the node to be connected to other operation 
 nodes.</p>

<p>There are two special types of operation nodes that 
 do not wrap any <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileProcessor</span> 
 operation. These are the <em>start</em> 
 and <em>terminating</em> operation nodes. 
 The start operation node stores nothing more than a semantic and index. 
 When it comes time to process a profile, this start node is used to find 
 the data stream on a mesh that will undergo some set of operations. At 
 the end of every operation node chain is a terminating node. While the 
 terminating node does not wrap any specific operation, it does provide 
 instructions that may further manipulate the data stream. It also provides 
 information on how the system is to react in the event that the succession 
 of operations fail for some reason or another (for example, if the starting 
 data stream could not be found). The specific components of what the terminating 
 operation node provides are listed below:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li><b>Required</b><br>
	If the terminating node is marked <em>required</em>, 
 then errors will be generated in the event that the succession of operation 
 nodes fail to generate a valid data stream. On the other-hand, if <em>
 not</em> required, no errors will be generated. 
 It is often the case that profiles will mark data streams as <em>not</em> 
 required in order to have a single profile serve a larger set of scenarios.</li>
	
	<li><b>Data 
 Stream Access Flags</b><br>
	The terminating node typically will not involve itself with changing 
 the data stream access flags of the resulting data stream. In some cases 
 however, it may be desired to do so and in that case data stream access 
 can be explicitly specified. When the data stream access flags are explicitly 
 specified, the resulting data stream (if it can be generated) will be 
 guaranteed to have <em>at least</em> that 
 level of access (merging with mesh modifier requirements may <em>increase</em> 
 access - See <a href="#Merging_Mesh_Modifier_Requirements_into_Profiles">merging 
 profiles with mesh modifier requirements</a> for more details). </li>
	
	<li><b>Usage</b><br>
	In nearly all cases, the terminating node will not involve itself with 
 changing the data stream usage setting. However, explicitly setting the 
 data stream usage can be controlled by the terminating node.</li>
	
	<li><b>Strict 
 Format</b><br>
	The final format of a data stream ultimately depends on the chain of 
 operations that are performed on the starting data streams. In some cases, 
 the final format is not compatible with a mesh modifiers requirements, 
 but could be compatible if the system were allowed to make a few tweaks 
 to the chain of operations or possibly by inserting an operation of some 
 sort. By marking the format as <em>strict</em>, 
 these tweaks will not be allowed and it can be guaranteed that the format 
 specified by the profile will be honored. By marking the format as <em>not</em> strict, these small tweaks will 
 be allowed and offer a greater chance for compatibility with mesh modifier 
 requirements.</li>
	
	<li><b>Stream 
 ID</b><br>
	Each terminating node allows for specifying a Stream ID to be associated 
 with the resulting data stream. Any data streams having the same Stream 
 ID will be interleaved together. Because of the data stream requirements 
 imposed by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileProcessor</span>, 
 the Stream ID is only applicable during the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Finalize</span> 
 stage.</li>
	
	<li><b>Strict 
 Interleave</b><br>
	When attempting to interleave data streams based on their Stream ID, 
 failure may result for various reasons (for example - incompatible usage 
 and access flags, etc.). Additionally, mesh modifier requirements may 
 place demands on how data streams should be interleaved. By indicating 
 that strict interleaving is <em>not</em> 
 required, mesh modifiers will have a greater chance of meeting their interleaving 
 requirements and errors will not result in cases where data streams can 
 not be interleaved as specified by the profile. If it is necessary to 
 enforce interleaving a specific set of data stream elements, then strict 
 interleave should be used.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a final note, every profile maintains an independent 
 array of terminating operation nodes. </p>

<h3>Keep Unspecified Streams</h3>

<p>A Mesh Profile maintains a setting which indicates if 
 unspecified streams should be kept or not. When a profile specifies that 
 unspecified streams should be kept, it is ensured that any data streams 
 that do not participate in operations (haven't been specified by the profile) 
 will <em>not</em> be removed from the 
 mesh. Conversely, a Mesh Profile can specify that unspecified streams 
 should be removed from the final mesh. One note is that streams that are 
 removed will not be available to satisfy mesh modifier requirements. </p>

<a name=Mesh_Profile_Fragments></a><h2>Mesh Profile Fragments</h2>

<p>Because data streams may or may not be shared between 
 a set of mesh, special considerations must be made to accommodate for 
 that fact. Issues that may arise and that must be dealt with are, for 
 example:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Attempts to interleave 
 data streams that have different sharing patterns.</li>
	
	<li>Attempts to merge and 
 swizzle components from data streams that are shared differently.</li>
	
	<li>Attempts to process 
 the same data streams twice because of it being shared by a number of 
 mesh objects. </li>
</ul>

<p>To deal with these issues, data streams are organized 
 into groups based on how they are shared between different mesh. This 
 is done with the help of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMeshTools/NiToolPipelineCloneHelper.htm">NiToolPipelineCloneHelper</a></span>. 
 Each of the groups then receives a portion of the profile and this portion 
 is referred to as a profile fragment. The profile fragment contains a 
 subset of the terminating operation nodes from the original profile. How 
 the subsets are formed is based on what the needs of the starting nodes 
 are.</p>

<p>By dealing with data stream groups and profile fragments 
 (as opposed to mesh objects and profiles), it is easier to ensure that 
 data streams are only processed once. Further, it is easier to detect 
 when operations such as merge and swizzle and interleaving of data streams 
 should fail. It should be noted that data stream sharing out of the exporters 
 may impose restrictions on profiles that wouldn't otherwise be present.</p>

<a name=Mesh_Profile_Operations></a><h2>Mesh Profile Operations</h2>

<p>The heart of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileProcessor</span> 
 system lie in the operations that are used to process data streams. Most 
 of the operations typically take an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamRef.htm">NiDataStreamRef</a></span> 
 as one of the inputs and outputs an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamRef.htm">NiDataStreamRef</a></span> 
 having the operational effect. The operations assume that there is only 
 one semantic element for the underlying data stream (for other assumptions, 
 see <a href="#Additional_Assumptions_and_Restrictions">Assumptions, Restrictions, 
 and Requirements on NiDataStreamRef 
 objects</a>). The following are the available operations for constructing 
 a profile:</p>

<h3>Remap Values</h3>

<p>The Remap 
 operation allows for linear remapping 
 one range of values into another specified range. Inversion of ranges 
 is supported. Values that fall outside of the source range will also be 
 remapped by 
 the same linear function (there is no concept of user defined min/max 
 clamping within the operation). Automatic min/max 
 <em>type</em> clamping will occur, however, 
 to prevent values from being remapped 
 to a number not representable by the data type. Finally, the remapping 
 can be applied to all components by default, or if desired, a single component 
 may be designated.</p>

<h3>Clamp Values</h3>

<p>The Clamp operation allows for clamping values to a 
 specified min/max 
 range. Automatic min/max 
 type clamping will override the specified min/max 
 range to prevent values from being clamped to a number not representable 
 by the data type (though, the situations where this would occur are few). 
 Finally, the clamping can be applied to all components by default, or 
 if desired, a single component may be designated.</p>

<h3>Cast-Convert</h3>

<p>The Cast-Convert operation allows for the conversion 
 of one format into another format having the same component count. The 
 operation takes two additional inputs over the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamRef.htm">NiDataStreamRef</a></span> 
 itself. The first input is a <em>type</em> 
 (<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm#Public_Types">NiDataStreamElement::Type</a></span>) 
 designation. The output format will retain the component count of the 
 source format, but will be changed to the type specified. Hence, the resulting 
 format can only be one of the known predefined formats. The second additional 
 input specifies the casting-method that is used to convert the underlying 
 data (and incidentally, the third method will affect the resulting format). 
 The three possible casting methods are:</p>

<ol style="list-style: decimal;"
	type=1>
	
	<li>Blind Cast<br>
	This method instructs a blind-cast of the old value to the new type 
 without regard to the range of the new data type.</li>
	
	<li>Type Clamp Cast<br>
	This method instructs a cast of the old value to the new type but will 
 clamp values to the range of the new data type.</li>
	
	<li>Normalize Cast<br>
	This method instructs a cast of the 
 old value to the new type but will include a built-in remapping 
 from the range of the source to the range of the destination. In the case 
 of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">T_FLOAT16</a> 
 </span>and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">T_FLOAT32</a></span> 
 values, the range will be considered <span class="NDLSystemFont">0.0</span> 
 to <span class="NDLSystemFont">1.0</span>. Finally, if the normalize-cast 
 method is chosen, one of the predefined normalized formats will be chosen 
 (if available) for the output format. As an example, given a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">F_FLOAT32_3</a></span> 
 formatted data stream, one could specify that the <em>type</em> 
 be <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">T_UINT16</a></span> 
 and the <em>cast-method</em> be normalize-cast. 
 The resulting format would be <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">F_NORMUINT16_3</a></span> 
 and the underlying data would have been remapped 
 to the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">T_UINT16</a></span> 
 type range.</li>
	
	<li>Smart Cast<br>
	This method instructs that the cast should only occur if there is no 
 lost of data. For example, going from a T_UINT32 to a T_UINT16 would only 
 take place if all values in the originating data-stream could be cast 
 without lost of data. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Component-Pack</h3>

<p>The Component-Pack operation allows for a special type 
 of conversion where all the components of a semantic element are packed 
 into 4 bytes. The actual number of bits allocated for each packed component 
 depends on the packed format type. The available formats are any of the 
 predefined packed formats: <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">F_UINT_10_10_10_L1</a>, 
 </span><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">F_NORMINT_10_10_10_L1</a>, 
 </span><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">F_UINT_10_10_10_2</a>, 
 </span><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">F_NORMINT_10_10_10_2</a>, 
 </span><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">F_NORMINT_11_11_10</a>. 
 </span>See Mesh Profile Supported Formats for details concerning using 
 these formats.</p>

<h3>Reinterpret Format</h3>

<p>The Reinterpret-Format operation allows for specifying 
 how a data stream is to be interpreted without actually changing the data 
 stream. This operation may be used to slap on a specialized format or 
 to combine/split up components on an existing format. For example, a stream 
 having a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">F_FLOAT32_2</a></span> 
 format could, in some cases, be reinterpreted as a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">F_FLOAT32_4</a></span>. 
 In this case, the overall range would decrease by half as the component 
 count per item would have double. This points out the fact that some reinterpretations 
 will fail. For example, reinterpreting a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">F_FLOAT32_3</a></span> 
 to a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">F_FLOAT32_4</a></span> 
 would only work if the first stream had the proper size to fill the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">F_FLOAT32_4</a></span> 
 request.</p>

<h3>Merge and Swizzle Components</h3>

<p>The Merge-and-Swizzle operation allows for selective 
 mixing of components from one or more semantic elements. Any component 
 may be placed into any desired order, may be used more than once, or not 
 at all. Literal values may also be specified in the operation. For example, 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont">R</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">G</span> 
 components may be taken from the <span class="NDLSystemFont">COLOR</span> 
 element while an X component might be taken from the <span class="NDLSystemFont">POSITION</span> 
 element. A literal value could also be pushed into the mix. The resulting 
 data stream would have 4 components and might be specified to merge in 
 this configuration: [<span class="NDLSystemFont">R, X, G, 
 1.0</span>] .</p>

<p>The Merge-and-Swizzle operation is unique in that it 
 may rely on multiple data streams for constructing the resulting <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamRef.htm">NiDataStreamRef</a></span>. 
 Because of this uniqueness, there are some special restrictions and additional 
 inputs that are required. The additional inputs are a semantic name and 
 index specification for the resulting <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamRef.htm">NiDataStreamRef</a></span>. 
 The restrictions are:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>All 
 inputs must have exactly the same underlying primitive. (ie, 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">T_FLOAT32</a></span>, 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">T_INT32</a></span>, 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">T_UINT8</a></span>, 
 etc.). </li>
	
	<li>All inputs must have 
 exactly the same cloning behavior</li>
	
	<li>All inputs must be 
 shared by the same set of mesh.</li>
	
	<li>All inputs must have 
 exactly the same write access</li>
	
	<li>All inputs must have 
 the same range</li>
	
	<li>All inputs must have 
 the same number of regions and region references</li>
	
	<li>All input streams must 
 have a "standard" format. (Ie - no <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm">F_NORMINT_11_11_10</a></span>, 
 etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rename Semantic</h3>

<p>The Rename operation allows for modifying the Semantic 
 name and Index. The Rename operation is unique in that it does not actually 
 modify the underlying data stream.</p>

<h3>Interleave</h3>

<p>The interleave functionality is not actually an operation. 
 It consists of special functionality that only occurs in the Finalize 
 stage and only after all other operations have been performed. It allows 
 for specifying that elements should be combined into a single stream. 
 For example, <span class="NDLSystemFont">POSITION</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NORMAL</span> 
 may exist as single element streams, but after interleaving, the two elements 
 (if specified in this manner) would exist within a single stream. If, 
 for some reason, interleaving is not possible between elements, an error 
 would result depending on if the elements were specified as strict-interleave 
 or not. If no error occurs, then the elements would be split and coalesced 
 with other splits..</p>

<a name=Merging_Mesh_Modifier_Requirements_into_Profiles></a><h2>Merging Mesh Modifier Requirements into Profiles</h2>

<p>During the Finalize stage, mesh modifiers are given 
 a chance to specify requirements which the profile will attempt to accommodate. 
 The mesh modifier exposes its requirements via the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiMeshRequirements.htm">NiMeshRequirements</a></span> 
 data structure and can be retrieved via <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiMeshModifier.htm">NiMeshModifier::RetrieveRequirements</a></span> 
 method. Since profiles may specify fairly complex operations and relationships 
 between various data streams, the range of accommodations are somewhat 
 limited. In particular, whether or not a <em>format</em> 
 change can be accommodated depends first upon whether or not the profile 
 has specified the format to be strict. Secondly, it depends largely on 
 the sequence of operations that defines that data stream since various 
 operations like Merge-and-Swizzle, Cast-Convert, and Reinterpret Format, 
 can all influence the final format. Other attributes such as <em>access 
 flags</em> and <em>usage</em> are a 
 bit more straight forward. Access flags, when merged, always allow for 
 increases in privileges. Usage can never differ.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiMeshRequirements.htm">NiMeshRequirements</a></span> 
 structure allows mesh modifiers to also specify their interleaving requirements. 
 In cases where the profile or the modifier request strict-interleaving 
 between a set of semantics, those sets can not conflict else the merge 
 will fail.</p>

<p>When modifiers do exist, the specific profile fragment 
 is manipulated so as not to affect the static profile which may be shared 
 by other mesh objects. Since the final format of a data stream, its access 
 flags, and usage can depend on the starting conditions of the data stream 
 (for example, as passed in via the DCC tool or as manipulated by plug-ins), 
 merging of requirements can only occur during the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Finalize</span> 
 stage.</p>

<a name=Additional_Assumptions_and_Restrictions></a><h2>Assumptions, Restrictions, and Requirements on NiDataStreamRef objects</h2>

<p>In order for operations to work smoothly with data streams, 
 certain restrictions are made by <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileProcessor</span>. 
 Any developer writing or modifying plug-ins and/or writing mesh modifiers 
 should familiarize themselves with the following restrictions/requirements:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>All <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamRef.htm">NiDataStreamRef</a></span> 
 inputs should be valid and contain a non-<span class="NDLSystemFont">NULL</span> 
 data stream.</li>
	
	<li>All <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamRef.htm">NiDataStreamRef</a></span> 
 inputs are required to have exactly one semantic element that represents 
 the underlying data stream. This is to say that no elements should be 
 interleaved together until after the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Finalize</span> 
 stage has run. <span class="NDLSystemFont">Finalize</span> will, in fact, 
 de-interleave streams if such are found.</li>
	
	<li>All <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiMesh/NiDataStreamRef.htm">NiDataStreamRef</a></span> 
 inputs should have their semantic element in one of the known predefined 
 formats.</li>
	
	<li>If a data stream is 
 shared by more than 1 mesh object, then every other data stream on that 
 mesh, if also shared by more than 1 mesh, should be shared by the exact 
 same set of mesh objects.</li>
</ul>

 by the mesh profile system within an application. It also illustrates
