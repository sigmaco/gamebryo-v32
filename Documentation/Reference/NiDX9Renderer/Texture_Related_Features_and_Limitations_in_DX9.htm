<h1>Texture-Related Features and Limitations in DX9</h1>

<p>The following sections describe basic texture-related features
and limitations of the current version of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiDX9Renderer.htm">NiDX9Renderer</a></span>.</p>

<h2>Required Hardware Capabilities</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9Renderer</span> requires
the display hardware to support at least two textures in a single
pass. Hardware that does not support this capability will fail
renderer creation.</p>

<h2>Cube Mapping</h2>

<p>The DX9 renderer supports both rendered and source cube
mapping on all platforms that support them. As a result, the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">DIFFUSE_CUBE_MAP</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SPECULAR_CUBE_MAP</span> texture
coordinate generation modes are supported. Cube Maps may be used
in any type of projected multitexture effect. Note that not all
hardware can support Cube Maps. If the hardware cannot support
Cube Maps, then <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Ni*CubeMap::Create</span> will return
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NULL</span>.</p>

<h2>Specular Bump Mapping</h2>

<p>The DX9 renderer supports specular bump mapping on 3D hardware
that can support it (either via <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">BUMPENVMAP</span> or <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">BUMPENVMAPLUMINANCE</span>). On hardware that
cannot support bump mapping, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDX9Renderer</span> detects the lack of support
and the effect will be dropped.</p>

<h2>Diffuse Bump Mapping</h2>

<p>The DX9 renderer can be used to render using diffuse Dot3 bump
mapping on 3D hardware that can support it, but an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> object will be required to
perform the effect. This is a result of the limitations of the
fixed-function DirectX vertex and texture pipelines.</p>

<h2>Non-Power-of-Two Texture Size</h2>

<p>It may be desirable to use non-power-of-two pixel dimensions
in some cases, e.g., for full-screen splash screens, or when
using the backbuffer as a rendered texture. Gamebryo supports
non-power-of-two texture dimensions on hardware that supports
them. Thus, textures may have non-power-of-two pixel dimensions
if the hardware supports them and certain conditions are met, but
otherwise power-of-two pixel dimensions will be required.</p>

<p>Specifically, modern graphics cards typically want power of 2
dimensions for 2D textures, but can work with any size under
certain conditions. For such cards (which are identified as
having both <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">D3DPTEXTURECAPS_POW2</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">D3DPTEXTURECAPS_NONPOW2CONDITIONAL</span> set for
caps), the following conditions must be met for non-power-of-two
dimensions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The texture addressing mode for the texture stage is set
    to clamp (texture wrapping is disabled).</li>

    <li>Mipmapping is not in use (use magnification filter
    only).</li>

    <li>Texture formats must not be <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">D3DFMT_DXT1</span> through <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">D3DFMT_DXT5</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the newest graphics cards have unconditional support
for 2D textures of any dimension; these cards are identified as
not having the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">D3DPTEXTURECAPS_POW2</span> cap set.</p>

<p>On the other hand, older graphics cards typically require
unconditionally that all 2D textures have widths and heights
specified as powers of two; for these cards, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">D3DPTEXTURECAPS_POW2</span> cap is set, but not
<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">D3DPTEXTURECAPS_NONPOW2CONDITIONAL</span>.</p>

<p>Whether you use textures with non-power-of-two dimensions will
ultimately depend on the target platforms you must consider for
your application.</p>

<h2>Texture Downsizing</h2>

<p>Most current 3D hardware has some limit on the maximum width
and height of each texture, although on most DX9-level 3D
hardware, these limits are very large (at least 1024x1024 or
2048x2048). The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9Renderer</span>
does not downsize textures automatically.</p>

<h2>Texture Compression</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9Renderer</span> supports
loading pre-compressed texture data, and can support on-the-fly
compression if a compressing image converter is used. See the
<a href=
"../../Programmer/Texturing/Introduction_to_Texturing.htm">Texturing</a>
documentation for details of how to create compressed texture
data. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9Renderer</span> will
load compressed data directly to the 3D hardware on 3D devices
that support compression, while the applications using the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDevImageConverter</span> will also
be able to load and expand the compressed textures to
non-compressed formats automatically on hardware that cannot
support compressed textures directly.</p>

<h2>Texture Apply Modes Supported</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9Renderer</span> does not
support the <span class="NDLSystemFont">APPLY_DECAL</span>
texture-apply mode. Most DX9 hardware cards can support
<span class="NDLSystemFont">APPLY_REPLACE</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">APPLY_MODULATE.</span></p>

<h2>Texture Format Requests</h2>

<p>Texture format requests are fully supported via the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexture__FormatPrefs.htm">
NiTexture::FormatPrefs</a></span> object
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9Renderer</span> queries for
all available Gamebryo texture formats. The exact mapping of
format request objects to pixel formats is dependent upon the
target hardware and display pixel depth.</p>

<h2>Palettized Texture Formats</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9Renderer</span> does not
support palletized textures in the display hardware, as the DX9
interface implementation of palettes is too limiting to be
useful. Under DX9, only one palette is allowed per rendering
pass. As a result, more than one palletized texture cannot be
used in a single pass unless the palettes are the same. To
compensate for this, palletized textures must be expanded by the
image converter (such as the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDevImageConverter</span>) at load time. This
will be done automatically when an appropriate image converter is
in use.</p>

<h2>Sphere Mapping</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9Renderer</span> defaults
to world-space sphere mapping, as do most other renderers in
Gamebryo.</p>

<h2>Load Texture Files Direct to Renderer Hint</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9Renderer</span> supports
the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiSourceTexture.htm">NiSourceTexture</a></span>
hint to load texture files directly into renderer-specific
resources. The renderer uses the D3DX library to handle this
functionality. Textures in any texture format, even formats not
directly supported by the Gamebryo engine in general, will be
correctly loaded, but may be converted by the D3DX library. Such
conversions tend to maintain the texture data rather than the bit
depth, for example, a 16-bit A8R3G3B2 texture will be expanded to
a full 32-bit A8R8G8B8 rather than an alternative 16-bit
format.</p>

<p>The texture files that are supported by this feature include
DDS files, TGA files, and BMP files. Cube and volume textures
included in DDS files will be correctly loaded, but can only be
accessed via 3-component texture coordinates when used with
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShaders</span>. Textures in any
texture format will be correctly loaded, but may be
converted.</p>

<p>Any texture that will be used in a bump map (ie, the
<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTexture::FormatPrefs.PixelLayout</span> is
<span class="NDLSystemFont">BUMPMAP</span>) that is not in one of
the signed texture formats will fall back to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span>-based
loading mechanism so the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiImageConverter.htm">NiImageConverter</a></span>
can produce a texture using a signed format.</p>

<p>Textures loaded using this mechanism will not skip any mipmap
levels, even if <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderer::SetMipmapSkipLevel</span> has been
used to force textures to skip the highest mipmap level(s).</p>

<h2>Persistent Source Texture Renderer Data</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiDX9Renderer.htm">NiDX9Renderer</a></span> supports
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiDX9PersistentSrcTextureRendererData.htm">NiDX9PersistentSrcTextureRendererData</a></span>
objects as the means to accomplish DX9-specific texture format
conversions at export time for textures that are stored in the
scene's main NIF file. With this approach, DX9-specific source
texture renderer data may be loaded directly into DX9
renderer-specific resources at application load time, without
temporary memory allocations for conversion, and without time
spent doing conversions at load time.</p>

<p>Once a NIF has been exported from a modeling package with
internal DX9-specific textures, however, there is no falling back
to an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span>
based loading mechanism for load-time texture format conversions,
since there is no pixel data in that case.</p>

<p>Thus, the advantages of doing DX9-specific texture format
conversions at export time include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Improvements in "high water mark" behavior for texture
    memory at load time. In other words, temporary memory
    allocations for texture format conversion will not be
    required if a DX9-specific export option is requested in the
    art pipeline.</li>

    <li>Load time performance improvements, due to no texture
    format conversions at load time.</li>
</ul>

<p>A caveat to this approach is that the texture is configured
specifically for DX9 and for a particular class of graphics card,
and may not be loadable for use with other classes of graphics
cards, with alternative platforms, or with tools on the PC. In
such cases, <a href=
"../../Programmer/Texturing/Failures.htm">"error" replacement
textures</a> are used to indicate the error.</p>

<p>Note that each time a platform SDK (e.g., Xbox360 XDK or
Playstation3 SDK) changes, there is at least a possibility that
the new SDK will cause textures to be formatted differently on
that platform. It is not likely to happen frequently, but the
possibility exists. In such a case, it may be desirable to
re-export Nifs containing platform-specific textures using
exporters built with that platform's most recent SDK version.</p>

modeling packages.</p>
