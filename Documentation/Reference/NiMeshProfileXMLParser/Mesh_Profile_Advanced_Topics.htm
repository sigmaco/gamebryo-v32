<h1>XML Mesh Profile Advanced Topics</h1>

<h2>Semantic Name and Index</h2>

<p>A semantic name is the name given by the Mesh profile 
 author to the data stream element. The name is important for many different 
 reasons. It serves as a way to provide a descriptive name for what the 
 data is. It also is used to reference the data stream element by all parts 
 of the tool pipeline and runtime code. There are two types of semantic 
 names; the first is the common semantics, this is the commonly known data 
 stream elements that are defined in the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiCommonSemantics.htm">NiCommonSemantics</a></span> 
 object; the other type is the custom or arbitrary semantic name, this 
 is a name that is not important to the inner workings of Gamebryo but 
 would need to be known perhaps to a custom mesh modifier or some other 
 custom feature that needs to know about certain piece of data that is 
 referenced by the semantic name.</p>

<p>The semantic index is also used for referencing the 
 specific data stream element. By default the index is &quot;0&quot; unless 
 specified. The &quot;range&quot; attribute is a helper feature that allows 
 a mesh profile author to specify multiple data stream elements with the 
 same semantic name but different indices. A good example of this is the 
 &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">TEXCOORD</span>&quot; data stream element. 
 We support up to 8 texture coordinate sets so instead of authoring 8 copies 
 of the &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">TEXCOORD</span>&quot; data stream 
 element, the &quot;range&quot; attribute is used as a helper decreasing 
 the copy and paste code to a minimum.</p>

<p>Using the &quot;name&quot; attribute typically dictates 
 that a custom or arbitrary semantic name is desired. However, if the name 
 matches identically with a common semantic name, it is assumed that the 
 common semantic is desired. To guarantee the use of a common semantic, 
 it is recommended that the &quot;type&quot; attribute is used. This helps 
 the author explicitly state that they wish to use the common semantic. 
 It is possible to use both the &quot;name&quot; and the &quot;type&quot;, 
 in which case, the semantic name is taking from the &quot;type&quot; attribute 
 and the &quot;name&quot; attribute is ignored. The &quot;name&quot; attribute 
 is used when referencing the element within the internal scope of the 
 XML. If no &quot;name&quot; is giving but a &quot;type&quot; is given, 
 then the element is referenced using the common semantic name.</p>

<h2>Mesh Profile Finalize Streams</h2>

<p>Finalize streams are linked to single element data-streams 
 on a mesh. By default, the Gamebryo exporters exports each semantic element 
 in its own data-stream. Finalize streams allow the mesh profile author 
 to have some control over the final layout of the data streams used by 
 the renderer. The 
 profile author can manipulate elements by converting them form one format 
 to another, or by merging and swizzling components, renaming semantics, 
 and even by specify how different semantic elements become interleaved 
 together. </p>

<h2>Swizzling and Merging</h2>

<p>Swizzling is the process by which the components in 
 a stream have their order rearranged. Merging, in contrast, is the process 
 of combining components from different streams in order to from a new 
 stream of select components. Together, these operations form a powerful 
 tool that can be used under many different instances. For example, swizzling 
 and merging may be useful in ambient occlusion. Ambient occlusion can 
 be stored in only a single component of a color channel. In the DCC tool, 
 two color channels can be created - one for the diffuse and the other 
 for the ambient occlusion. The DCC tool creates these as two separate 
 4 component float streams. The two streams can be merged together by taking 
 the &quot;r&quot; component of the ambient occlusion stream and merging 
 it with the &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">r</span>&quot;, &quot;<span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">g</span>&quot;, and &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">b</span>&quot; 
 (dropping the &quot;alpha&quot; component) of the diffuse color stream. 
 As long as the vertex shader is aware of this, the lighting calculation 
 can be handled appropriately. This process halves the amount of memory 
 required. </p>

<h2>Clamping and Remapping</h2>

<p>Clamping is process which defines and enforces the range 
 of values contained by select components. If the component contains values 
 greater than the maximum allowed, then those values are clamped to that 
 maximum value. Conversely, if the component contains value which are less 
 than the minimum allowed, then those values are clamped to that minimum 
 value. This is important for many reasons. Many times you need to do certain 
 calculations that only work on positive numbers so you may clamp the values 
 at 0. Perhaps you need to make sure the values are between 0.0 and 1.0 
 to have a certain calculation perform correctly.</p>

<p>Remapping is the process of defining a linear remapping 
 of one range to another for select components. The following is an example: 
 Suppose that the components values currently consist of values between 
 0.0 to 1.0. Then assume that it is desired to have the component to ultimately 
 be represented as a byte. This 
 can be accomplished by setting the source range to be 0.0 and 1.0, and 
 the destination range to be from 0 and 255. In fact, this could be done 
 automatically when assigning the &quot;convertype&quot; to be &quot;<span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NORMALIZED</span>&quot; for the data stream. To get 
 more information on this please see the format converting section below. 
 </p>

<p>It is useful to note that the clamping will always occur 
 before a remap takes place. This is important because the results may 
 not be what you want if you can not guarantee the source value ranges. 
 Perhaps you were taking the above example of going between 0 and 1 to 
 0 and 255. If your source value was outside of 0 and 1 your remapped value 
 might not be what you are expecting. In this case you may wish to clamp 
 your source values to 0 and 1 to guarantee the source data.</p>

<p>If a clamp or a remap is done on the &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">POSITION</span>&quot; 
 data stream element, then the meshes bounds will be automatically recomputed. 
 This ensures that the mesh bound will match the actual mesh data.</p>

<a name=Converting></a><h2>Converting</h2>

<p>Converting is the process of transforming a data-stream 
 element from one format to another format. For example, consider the default 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">COLOR</span> channel that starts off in a 4 
 component float format. Suppose that it is decided to change the format 
 to that of an unsigned normalized byte format in order to save memory. 
 This can be accomplished by specifying the &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">convertformat</span>&quot; 
 as &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">UINT8</span>&quot; and the &quot;<span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">converttype</span>&quot; as &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">NORMALIZED</span>&quot;. 
 The convert type is the processing that takes place during the conversion. 
 The options for this are &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">NORMALIZED</span>&quot; 
 which takes the input range and alters the data to fit in the new range 
 dictated by the data type. Not only that, but it attempts to match the 
 resulting format to one that is normalized (ex. <span class="NDLSystemFont">F_NORMUINT8_4</span>). 
 Most of the time there is no need to use the remapping process described 
 in the previous section when a <span class="NDLSystemFont">converttype </span>of 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NORMALIZED </span>is used. It should also be 
 noted that the converting process will be performed after clamping/remapping 
 and swizzling and merging. The next option is a &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">TYPECLAMP</span>&quot; 
 which simply clamps the data to fit within the new data type boundaries. 
 The next convert type is &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">BLINDCAST</span>&quot; 
 which simply casts the data to the new type and ignores possible wrapping 
 issues. Finally, there is the &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">SMARTCAST</span>&quot; 
 which is intended to convert data types to a lower bit representations, 
 but only does so if the data values are such that there will be no lost 
 of information. For example, going from a 32 bit unsigned integer to a 
 16 bit unsigned integer would only occur if all data values in the data-stream 
 were representable by 16-bits.</p>

<h2>Interleaving</h2>

<p>Interleaving is the process of constructing a single 
 data-stream from many single element data-streams. This is very important 
 for per-vertex data on meshes because all the types of data (position, 
 normal, UVs) are needed for a single vertex before it can be processed. 
 If all of this data were in separate data-streams, the likelihood that 
 a cache miss would occur when fetching would be much higher than if all 
 of the data for that single vertex were adjacent in a single data stream.</p>

<p>In general, it is best for performance to have all per-vertex 
 data interleaved into a single stream. However, there are some situations 
 where it is better to have separate data-streams for some elements. How 
 best to interleave data is closely related to access flags, which are 
 discussed in more detail below.</p>

<h2>Access Flags</h2>

<p>Access flags determine if the CPU or GPU can read or 
 write data associated with a mesh. Access flags determine how the mesh 
 data is stored into memory, which could lead to data being stored in multiple 
 locations. Access flags have a rendering performance impact as well.</p>

<p>If the access flags include CPU read or any CPU write 
 flag except <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_STATIC</span> then the 
 stream must be stored in system memory. If any GPU flags are set, then 
 the stream must be stored is video memory. If the stream is needed in 
 both places, then two copies of the stream may exist. For this reason 
 it is important to only set access flags that are needed. For example, 
 if a particular element is not needed for rendering it might be better 
 to split it up into a separate stream that does not have the <span class="NDLSystemFont">GPU_READ</span> 
 flag set. This will decrease the amount of video ram that the mesh uses 
 and increase rendering performance.</p>

<p>When data streams must be written to by the CPU and 
 used for rendering, then either <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_VOLATILE</span> 
 or <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_MUTABLE</span> should be used. 
 There is a performance tradeoff between these two choices, so one should 
 determine how the data is expected to be used before making a selection.</p>

<p>Volatile data streams do not get stored in video memory 
 between frames. Instead, when the frame is rendered, whatever memory is 
 available is used. This causes the actual rendering performance to decrease 
 but gives a speed increase when updating the data coming from the CPU. 
 Mutable data streams do not have as much rendering overhead, but stay 
 in the same place in video memory from frame to frame which causes the 
 cost of updating the contents of the stream to increase. In general, a 
 data stream should be volatile when the contents of the stream are expected 
 to be changed per-frame (such as a mesh with morphing), and it should 
 be mutable if the stream will be updated less frequently.</p>

<h2>Strict Flags</h2>

<p>The strict flags allow the mesh profile author more 
 control on how the profile gets adjusted by the mesh modifiers. The default 
 is set to &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">NOT_STRICT</span>&quot;. Mesh 
 modifiers have requirements that may not be compatible with the assigned 
 mesh profile. The mesh modifier adjusts the profile to allow the modifier 
 to work. The strict flags give the mesh profile author control of this 
 by not allowing the mesh modifier to adjust the format or adjust the interleaving. 
 Use &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">STRICT_FORMAT</span>&quot; if you 
 need to guarantee that the format can not be adjusted. In the event that 
 a mesh modifier needs to modify the format, then the merge process will 
 fail and the modifier will ultimately be removed. Use &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">STRICT_INTERLEAVE</span>&quot; 
 to ensure that the streams are interleaved or not interleaved the way 
 the profile dictates. As before, if the requirements of a mesh modifier 
 are not compatible with the profiles strict interleave specification, 
 then the modifier will ultimately be removed.</p>

<h2>Arbitrary Per-vertex Data</h2>

<p>When an element of mesh data is added to a mesh, it 
 is associated with a semantic and an index. The element's semantic is 
 a string that identifies the element. Using a mesh profile, any string 
 can be provided as the semantic for a data stream, which allows to arbitrary 
 add custom per-vertex data to a mesh rather than having to use what is 
 created by the exporters.</p>

<p>The data that is stored in these elements is not created 
 by the mesh profile, but can be created either from a tool plug-in or 
 by renaming and merging data that comes from elements created by the exporters. 
 Following is an example of a mesh profile element that takes the red channel 
 of the vertex colors from the exporter and renames it:</p>

<pre>
&lt;FinalizeStream name="OcclusionStream" access="CPU_READ"&gt;
    &lt;Element name="Occlusion"&gt;
        &lt;Component value="COLOR[0].r" /&gt;
    &lt;/FinalizeStream&gt;
&lt;/FinalizeStream&gt;
</pre> 

<p>When this profile is assigned to a mesh that contains 
 a vertex color element, a data-stream by the name 'Occlusion' will be 
 created. This data-stream would only be accessible to the CPU and would 
 not be stored in video memory (because of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_READ</span> 
 attribute). Such an element could be used to determine a visibility value 
 (indicating how well an object can be seen) for the purposes of AI. In 
 this case, you could pick against the stage geometry at the object's position 
 and use the pick results to figure out how obscured an object should be 
 at that part of the stage. Using the mesh profile system, this information 
 can either be painted directly on the mesh by an artist, or procedurally 
 generated on export using a custom tool plug-in.</p>

<h2>Using Arbitrary Per-vertex Data With Materials</h2>

<p>Another use for per-vertex data is as an input to a 
 custom shader. This might allow for many kinds of interesting effects. 
 An example of using arbitrary per-vertex data might be blending the influence 
 of one or more textures using a blend value that is set per-vertex.</p>

<p>In order to make custom per-vertex data available to 
 a custom shader or material, some extra work must be done. The way this 
 is done is through the <a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiSemanticAdapterTable.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSemanticAdapterTable</span></a>. The application 
 needs to generate the mapping between the custom or arbitrary semantic 
 name to the common renderable semantic name.</p>

<h2>Mesh Profiles and Mesh Modifiers</h2>

<p>When creating mesh profiles it is important to 
 recognize that the resulting mesh may have its data arranged differently 
 than you have specified in your profile. This happens in order to make 
 the mesh compatible with any Mesh Modifiers that have been applied.</p>

<p>The mesh modifiers such as skinning or morphing 
 have certain requirements for the data streams. Example would be the presence 
 of bind positions for a skinned object. If this stream does not exist, 
 then the skinning modifier can not work and is detached from the mesh. 
 These requirements are better explained in the <a href="../../Programmer/NiMesh/Standard_Gamebryo_Mesh_Modifier_Requirements.htm">mesh 
 modifier requirements</a> section.</p>

<p>The most important item for a mesh profile author to 
 consider is whether they wish to support the standard mesh modifiers morphing 
 and skinning. To 
 support the skinning modifier the profile must have a <span class="NDLSystemFont">POSITION_BP</span>, 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">BONES</span>, and <span class="NDLSystemFont">BLENDWEIGHTS</span>. 
 Optionally you would need <span class="NDLSystemFont">NORMAL_BP</span>, 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">TANGENT_BP</span>, and <span class="NDLSystemFont">BINORMAL_BP</span> 
 if the corresponding non bind pose element exists. Morphing requires &quot;<span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">MORPH_??</span>&quot; elements. This could be &quot;<span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">MORPH_POSITIONS</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">MORPH_COLORS</span>&quot; 
 or any custom semantic you wish to morph. The only other element is the 
 &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">MORPHWEIGHTS</span>&quot; semantic. If 
 any of the these requirements are not met the morph mesh modifier is removed 
 from the mesh object. Follow the links below to get more information on 
 skinning and morphing requirements.</p>
