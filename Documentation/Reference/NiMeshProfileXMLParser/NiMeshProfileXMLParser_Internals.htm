<h1>NiMeshProfileXMLParser Internals</h1>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileXMLParser</span>
library is an internal use only library. Its primary function is
to parse XML based representations of a mesh profile into the
in-memory mesh profiles that are used by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileProcessor</span> library. The
details of how this is done should not concern most developers,
however, the following high level documentation is provided in
the event that a developer requires a better understanding of
this library's internal data structures and operations.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileXMLParser</span>
library is library that converts mesh profiles stored as XML
files to an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../NiMeshProfileProcessor/Introduction_to_NiMeshProfileProcessor.htm">
NiOpProfile</a></span> object. This is done in four stages. The
first stage is the simple XML parsing of the text. The second
stage is the conversion from the XML nodes to an appropriate
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfile</span> object. The
third is the compilation of these <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfile</span> objects into the renderer
specific mesh profiles. The fourth and final stage is the
conversion of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfile</span> object to an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../NiMeshProfileProcessor/Introduction_to_NiMeshProfileProcessor.htm">
NiOpProfile</a></span> object.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileComponent</span>
stores a single component data for the parent element. This
component contains a type which is best known as x, y, z, w.
Components can be <a href=
"../NiMeshProfileProcessor/Introduction_to_NiMeshProfileProcessor.htm">
remapped</a> and <a href=
"../NiMeshProfileProcessor/Introduction_to_NiMeshProfileProcessor.htm">
clamped</a> to provide a way of altering the data or simply
validating the ranges of the data. The components can be linked
to other components to perform <a href=
"../NiMeshProfileProcessor/Introduction_to_NiMeshProfileProcessor.htm">
swizzle or merge</a> operations.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileElement</span> stores
one to four <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileComponent</span> objects. The
element also stores the semantic name and index which is used to
throughout the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span>
system to reference data streams. Elements store the data
necessary to build up the operational nodes to handle <a href=
"../NiMeshProfileProcessor/Introduction_to_NiMeshProfileProcessor.htm">
format, rename, swizzle and merge</a> changes.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileStream</span> stores
an array of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileElement</span> objects. This class
is used for the finalize streams. These streams not only store
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileElement</span>
objects but also can specify the access flags and usage for the
stream. The name of the stream only matters in the context of the
XML. The name is used to reference streams within the current
scope of the profile.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfile</span> stores an
array of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileStream</span>
objects for the finalize phase. The profile is the parent object
that gets directly converted to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiOpProfile</span> class. The profile contains
not just the streams but also the profile's name and description.
The description is used to give a "real" world explanation of
what this profile is suppose to do. This is exposed to the
artists in the DCC tool.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileGroup</span> stores
an array of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfile</span>
objects, one per renderer type. This is the container object that
organizes the profiles and has simple functions to return a
profile given an index or a name.</p>

<p>The library is initialized with a parameter specifying a
directory containing the projects mesh profiles. The parameter
can contain multiple directories separated by a semi colon ";".
The default directory
<em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Media\ToolPluginsData\MeshProfiles automatically
gets appended to the path name. This is to insure that the
Gamebryo Default profile is also included. The library parses all
the XML files it finds. It then compiles all the parsed data into
the renderer specific <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfile</span> objects.</p>

<p>The compilation of this data is done by fixing up all links.
This makes sure that if you are linking to an externally declared
stream, that the stream is included into the final profile. After
all the links have been fixed up, the references are also fixed
up. References are simply cloned into the mesh profile object.
After all the data is compiled together, it is then validated.
Any invalid profiles are removed from the available profile list.
The check for validation simply makes sure that the profile
contains at least one finalization stream. This, however, does
not mean that there were not any parsing or compilation errors.
You can verify your profiles by using the <a href=
"../../Tools/MeshProfileCompiler/MeshProfileCompiler_Intro.htm">
MeshProfileCompiler</a> tool. For help in authoring mesh profiles
check out the <a href=
"../../Art/Other/Introduction_to_Mesh_Profiles.htm">artist guide
to the mesh profile system</a>.</p>

<p>The conversion of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfile</span> object to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiOpProfile</span> object begins first by copying
the name and description from the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfile</span> object. The streams are
converted by iterating through each stream and through each
element and finally through each component. The first operation
node to be created is the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiOpStart</span>. This operational node is
initialized with the semantic and index given from the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileElement</span> object.
Iterating through all the components we detect if a clamp or a
remap needs to take place. It is important to note that the clamp
operation is always done before the remap operation. After this
takes place, the swizzle and merge operation is created by the
first component. The swizzle and merge operation is initialized
with the expected number of components and the new semantic name
given by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileElement</span> object. After all the
components have been processed and pushed into the swizzle and
merge node, the swizzle and merge node links with the cast
convert node if a format is required. The format is given from
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileElement</span>
object. If a format is not required it simply links to the
terminator node. The terminator node is the last operational node
and is initialized with the access flag and usage type for the
given element of the data stream.</p>
