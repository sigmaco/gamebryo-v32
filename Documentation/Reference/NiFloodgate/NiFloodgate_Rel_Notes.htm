<a name="Added_Features_and_Fixed_Bugs"></a><h2>Added Features, Changed Behavior, and Fixed Bugs</h2>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.2</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Legacy code to support operating systems older than Windows XP caused a race condition that
  could result in a Floodgate crash on a multi-core PC. The legacy code has been removed.</li>
  
  <li>The smart pointer declaration in
  <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiSPStream.htm">NiSPStream</a></span> has been removed.
  The smart pointer could never be instantiated because the
  <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPStream</span> class does not derive
  from the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRefObject</span> class. In development we found numerous
  problems with the shutdown and release of streams and tasks in Floodgate, and allowing smart
  pointers to streams would complicate matters considerably, leading to bugs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1</h3>

<ul>
  <li>None in this release.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.0</h3>

<ul>
  <li>None in this release.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.6.0</h3>

<ul>
	
	<li>Fixed the recursion 
 counter in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiSPAnalyzer.htm">NiSPAnalyzer</a>::Analyze</span> 
 to more accurately check for excessively deep recursion situations.</li>
	
	<li>Added an assert to 
 the <a href="NiSPStreamPartitioner.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPStreamPartitioner</span></a> implementation on 
 all platforms to catch the error case in which a task has input or output 
 streams of unequal block count. Fixed input streams can be of any block 
 count, and streams with NULL data do not assert.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.5.0</h3>

<ul>
	
	<li>The <a href="NiSPWorkflowManager.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager</span></a> class has been added. 
 It is used to batch <a href="NiSPTask.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPTask</span></a> objects into a single workflow.</li>
	
	<li>The <a href="NiSPDataStream.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPDataStream</span></a> class has been added to 
 simplify the specification of data sources for <a href="NiSPStream.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPStream</span></a> objects.</li>
	
	<li>The map used to rapidly 
 find workflows in the <a href="NiStreamProcessor.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiStreamProcessor</span></a> class has been changed 
 to an array. Given the functionality provided by this object, and the 
 memory usage associated with it, it was determined that an array was a 
 better structure.</li>
	
	<li>Added the ability to 
 specify the affinity of threads in Floodgate and the worker thread count. 
 These values are specified via callbacks which can be set through <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiSystem/NiInitOptions.htm">NiInitOptions</a></span> 
 or through interfaces on <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiStreamProcessor.htm">NiStreamProcessor</a></span>. 
 Note that these callbacks must be set prior to SDM init or they will not 
 change behavior.</li>
	
	<li>Added a serial execution 
 mode to Floodgate that can be enabled by specifying a worker thread count 
 of zero or by setting the appropriate flag in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../NiSystem/NiInitOptions.htm">NiInitOptions</a></span>.</li>
	
	<li>A bug in the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiStreamProcessor.htm">NiStreamProcessor</a></span> 
 class that caused infinite looping when more than 16 workflows were active 
 has been fixed.</li>
	
	<li>A bug where the kernel 
 size was not properly taken into account when computing optimal block 
 counts was fixed. </li>
 
 <li><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiSPWorkflow.htm">NiSPWorkflow</a></span> 
 objects are now reference counted, and applications should use a <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowPtr</span> smart pointer to reference 
 such objects. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflow</span> objects must 
 be created using <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStreamProcessor::GetFreeWorkflow</span> 
 or <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflow::GetFreeWorkflow</span>. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflow</span> objects are returned to the object 
 pool when their reference count goes to zero. </li>

	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiSPTask.htm">NiSPTask</a></span> 
 objects are now reference counted, and applications should use a <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPTaskPtr</span> smart pointer to reference such 
 objects. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPTask</span> objects must be created 
 using <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflow::AddNewTask</span> or <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPTask::GetNewTask</span>. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPTask</span> 
 objects are returned to the object pool when their reference count goes 
 to zero.</li>

	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiStreamProcessor.htm">NiStreamProcessor::Wait</a></span> 
 now treats the timeout value differently. A timeout of 0xFFFFFFFF is infinite 
 as opposed to Gamebryo 2.3 where 0 signified an infinite timeout. Additionally, 
 specifying a small timeout may return without yielding the thread now 
 resulting in improved performance. The timeout is now specified in microseconds 
 across all platforms.</li>
	
	<li>Extensive changes have 
 been made to the internals of Floodgate to reduce memory usage by a factor 
 of almost 100 with no performance penalty (and maybe an improvement). 
 This change has introduce dynamic memory allocation into the core of Floodgate, 
 structured such that memory allocations should not occur in a steady state 
 system. However, extra memory may be held in order to avoid steady state 
 allocations. The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiSPTask.htm">NiSPTask::SetIsCompacted</a></span> 
 function has been added so that applications can specify that tasks compact 
 their arrays to minimize memory. See the documentation for details on 
 the usage of compacted flag. Also note that the arrangement of data in 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiSPWorkload.htm">NiSPWorkload</a></span> 
 class has changed, so Floodgate kernels that were directly accessing <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkload </span>data (without using member functions) 
 will probably require modification.</li>
	
	<li>Extensive changes have 
 been made to the execution model on PC 
 and Xbox 360 reducing the overall CPU utilization. The Floodgate 
 dispatch thread will now only execute when tasks require dispatch or finalization 
 rather than actively polling the status of those tasks and workflows. 
 On PC, this has significantly improved the performance of the system. 
 On Xbox 360, performance is similar 
 to active polling but with a sizable reduction in CPU utilization for 
 the HW thread running the dispatch thread, HW Thread 1 by default.</li>

	
	<li>The default behavior 
 for worker thread allocation on PC has been changed to use the improved 
 CPU topology detection functions in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiSystem/NiSystemDesc.htm">NiSystemDesc</a></span>. 
 By default, the number of worker threads will use the following algorithm. 
 Users can override that algorithm using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetDefineWorkerThreadCountFunc</span> 
 interface in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiStreamProcessor.htm">NiStreamProcessor</a></span> 
 as noted above.
	
	<ul>
		
		<li>Systems with a 
 single physical core will allocate no worker threads and run in serial 
 execution mode. This scenario includes hyperthreaded machines which report 
 multiple logical cores.</li>
		
		<li>Systems with multiple 
 physical cores will allocate one less worker thread than the number of 
 physical cores.</li>

		
		<li>Systems with logical 
 core counts that exceed the physical core count will allocate one additional 
 worker thread for each two additional logical cores. For example, a system 
 with two physical and four logical cores will allocate one worker thread 
 for the two physical cores and one worker thread for the two additional 
 logical cores.</li>
	</ul>
	
	</li>
	
	<li>In order to provide 
 thread safety for <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiSPTask.htm">NiSPTask</a></span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiSPStream.htm">NiSPStream</a></span> 
 deletions, the behavior of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPStream</span> 
 has been changed (this was also necessary for other reasons). When all 
 of the tasks that reference an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPStream</span> 
 object are deleted (all the tasks that use it as an input and output), 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPStream::GetEffectiveInputSize</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPStream::GetEffectiveOutputSize</span> 
 will return 0. In this case, applications should also call <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPSTream::ClearTaskArrays</span> 
 to remove <span class="NDLSystemFont">NULL</span> entries from those arrays.</li>

	
	<li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiSPTask.htm">NiSPTask::SetOptimalBlockCount</a></span> 
 function has been superceded in almost all situations by automatic per-platform 
 code for setting the optimal block count. Applications should not use 
 this function unless they have a specific reason for wanting a certain 
 block count in a kernel, and care must be taken to avoid problematic situations 
 on some platforms. See the <a href="../../Programmer/NiFloodgate/Features_and_Limitations_of_Floodgate.htm">Known 
 Limitations.</a></li>

</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.3.0</h3>

<ul>
	
	<li>Implemented thread 
 pools for PC and Xbox 360. For more information on resource usage, please 
 refer to the <a href="../../Programmer/NiFloodgate/Features_and_Limitations_of_Floodgate.htm">NiFloodgate 
 Features and Limitations documentation</a>.</li>

	
	<li>Implemented 
 cache prefetching for input parameters on Xbox 360. For more information 
 on prefetching behavior, please refer to the <a href="../../Programmer/NiFloodgate/Features_and_Limitations_of_Floodgate.htm">NiFloodgate Features and Limitations documentation</a>.</li>
