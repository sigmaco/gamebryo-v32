<h1>Handling Lost or Removed Devices</h1>

<p>In the course of an application running, input devices can be
removed, re-inserted, or hot-swapped by users. In addition, new
devices can be plugged into previously empty ports.</p>

<p>When either of these events occur, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiInputSystem.htm#NiInputSystem::UpdateAllDevices">NiInputSystem::UpdateAllDevices</a></span>
or <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiInputSystem.htm#NiInputSystem::UpdateActionMap">NiInputSystem::UpdateActionMap</a></span>
calls will return one of error messages contained in the
following table:</p>
<!--(Table)=========================================================-->

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Return Value</th>

            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">NIIERR_DEVICECHANGE</span></td>

            <td>Indicates that a device has been removed or
            inserted. This includes devices plugged into
            previously 'empty' ports.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">NIIERR_DEVICELOST</span></td>

            <td>Typically indicates that one type of device has
            been removed, and a different type of device has been
            inserted in that port.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>In order to supply some amount of flexibility in how
applications utilize the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiInput</span> library, it is not assumed that
the devices being used will be 'held onto' by the app. However,
this document is written from the standpoint that they are.</p>

<p>If your application receives the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NIIERR_DEVICECHANGE</span> return value from one
of the input calls, it should check each device it uses to
determine which ones have been affected. This can be done by
viewing the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiInputDevice.htm#NiInputDevice::Status">NiInputDevice::Status</a></span>
member of each device it holds onto by calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiInputDevice.htm#NiInputDevice::GetStatus">NiInputDevice::GetStatus</a></span>.
If the status is <span class="NDLSystemFont">REMOVED</span>, the
application could pause game play and display a message
indicating the offending device should be reinserted.</p>

<p>Note that the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NIIERR_DEVICECHANGE</span> will also be received
when a device is inserted. This could indicate that a new device
has been inserted as well as a previously present device being
plugged back in. If your application is interested in detecting
new device insertions on previously empty ports, it should
iterate over the device descriptions using <a href=
"NiInputSystem.htm#NiInputSystem::GetFirstDeviceDesc"><span class="NDLSystemFont">
NiInputSystem::GetFirstDeviceDesc</span></a> and <a href=
"NiInputSystem.htm#NiInputSystem::GetNextDeviceDesc"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiInputSystem::GetNextDeviceDesc</span></a> to
find the 'new' device.</p>

<p>If you application receives the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NIIERR_DEVICELOST</span> return value, things are
a bit more complicated. When this occurs, the offending device(s)
will report their status as <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LOST</span>. In this case, the application should
release their reference to said device and re-acquire it through
another call to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiInputSystem::Open*</span>. Note that it is
important to check the description of the device at the port of
interest to ensure that the type is one that the application
desires.</p>

<p>For a more thorough example of handling lost and removed
devices, please refer to the InputDemo documentation.</p>
