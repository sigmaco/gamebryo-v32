<h1>Parallelism With NiLoopedThread</h1>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiLoopedThread.htm">NiLoopedThread</a></span> is a thread class
that facilitates repeated, parallelizable tasks. It can be
restarted multiple times to do a task with potentially different
inputs. This class is designed to parallelize and improve
performance for updating or culling a scene. The rest of this
documentation will mostly consider the update call, but
culling is both directly analogous and easier to parallelize.
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Learn/Demos/CharacterPerformanceDemo_intro.htm">CharacterPerformanceDemo</a></span>
and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Learn/Demos/BadSushi_intro.htm">BadSushi</a></span> are
working examples of parallel update.</p>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiLoopedThread</span> uses a helper class called
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiLoopedThreadProcedure.htm">NiLoopedThreadProcedure</a></span>
that does all the work specific to the task. To parallelize some
task, the first step is to derive a subclass from <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiLoopedThreadProcedure</span> and override the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">LoopedProcedure</span> function. This
is the function that will do all the work. This subclass should
also contain member variables that hold the information that a
task needs to know. In the case of an update call, this could
potentially be a list of nodes or actor managers. The
<span class="NDLSystemFont">LoopedProcedure</span> will reference
these member variables to do the task in parallel.</p>

<p>The second step is to partition the data for
the task into chunks. This step could be done as a preprocessing
step or on-the-fly, depending on the dynamic nature of the data.
For a scene graph, this data will be subgraphs that are ideally
wholly independent of each other. Partitioning a scene is not
always an easy task and is probably the largest hurdle to
parallelizing the update of a general scene. It is important to
be careful of objects that reference parts of the scene graph in
a non-hierarchical manner, such as <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiLookAtInterpolator.htm">NiLookAtInterpolator</a></span>
objects, or particle system emitter controllers. These types of
objects could cause problems if they are attached in a different
partition than their target. A parallel update of this scenario
will have a race condition between the update of that object and
the update of the target. If possible, these objects should be
partitioned with their target to avoid that race condition. If
that is not possible, then a secondary solution would be to
update them only after it is known that their target has been
updated. It is important to note that <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDynamicEffect.htm">NiDynamicEffect</a></span>-derived
objects do not have this problem, even though they may have a
scope that points to arbitrary places in the scene graph.
However, that link is not referenced until the rendering
pass.</p>

<p>There is a caveat about the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRandom</span> function. It wraps a call to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">rand</span>, which is non-reentrant.
The only parts of Gamebryo that uses this call during
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> are particle system
emitters, which randomly create particles. Simultaneous calls to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRandom</span> may potentially
return the same value. It is not likely, but is something to be
aware of.</p>

<p>In <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Learn/Demos/CharacterPerformanceDemo_intro.htm">CharacterPerformanceDemo</a></span>,
because of the homogenous nature of the scene graph, the scene is
partitioned equally between threads, with each one of <em>n</em>
threads handling 1/<em>n</em>th of the scene. All the characters
are attached at a single node, which means that they are not
strict partitions, because the parent node (which will be updated
as part of <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span>'s upward
pass) will be updated multiple times. However, for the upward
pass on an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span>, only the
bound will be updated. Because of this, that parent's bound could
be entirely inaccurate. This may not be a problem, such as in the
case of this <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CharacterPerformanceDemo</span> where that bound
isn't used at all. If it is, then the function <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateWorldBound</span> could be called after all
of the parallel updates have finished on any shared parent.
(Similar considerations apply for the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Learn/Demos/BadSushi_intro.htm">BadSushi</a></span>
demo.)</p>

<p>Partitioning with one thread per partition
is certainly not the only way to do a parallel update. It would
be fairly easy to modify this scheme to make the partitions
smaller and have many more partitions than threads. in that case,
the looped threads could request smaller chunks from some shared
repository of data within some fast critical section. They could
then signal that they were complete when there were no more
chunks left to process. This sort of scheme would be more suited
for a system where processors might not have equal processing
time available or for scenes that have parts that may take longer
to update than others. This would also help to automatically
balance the work a little more fairly between threads.</p>

<p>The last step is to actually tie together
and use the threads and the data. During the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> call, the member variables in the
derived <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiLoopedThreadProcedure</span> are set. At the
start of the call, all of the threads are suspended while waiting
to start their loop. After their member variables have been set,
the next step is to wake all of the threads up by calling their
<span class="NDLSystemFont">DoLoop</span> function which will run
a single iteration of the loop in the background. After the
threads have been woken up, then the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> call can loop through all of the
threads and call the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WaitForLoopCompletion</span> function. This
function will suspend the main thread until a thread completes
its loop. By waiting for all the looped threads at the end of the
function, it is guaranteed that the update has finished and all
the update threads are suspended. All the threads are now ready
to be re-used for the next <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> call.</p>
