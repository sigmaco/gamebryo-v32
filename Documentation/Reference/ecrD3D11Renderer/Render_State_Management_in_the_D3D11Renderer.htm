<h1>Render State Management in the D3D11Renderer</h1>

<p>In D3D11, render states are not set individually. Instead, a
collection of render states is collected in a structure and used
to create a D3D11 state object. That state object is then set on
the device. This system is different than the system used by
Gamebryo, which treats render states as independent parameters,
and is much more relaxed about allowing render states from
previous draw calls to remain intact.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"ecr__D3D11Renderer.htm">D3D11Renderer</a></span> reconciles this
difference by treating render states slightly differently than
other renderers. First of all, each object that gets drawn has a
completely defined render state. No render state values from
previously drawn objects are left on the device. This aligns well
with the D3D11 concept of state objects, and it prevents
occasional difficult-to-track-down problems caused by stale
render states getting applied to objects unexpectedly. It also
means that applications cannot rely on clever tricks to have one
shader set a render state that will be used to draw subsequent
objects, or on setting a render state from application code and
assuming that the state will not be overwritten by an object
being rendered. One final ramification is that it is no longer
necessary for shaders to save a render state before changing it
and restore a render state when it is done. As a result, no
shaders in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">D3D11Renderer</span>
either save or restore render states.</p>

<p>The way the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"ecr__D3D11Renderer.htm">D3D11Renderer</a></span>implements this
policy is through the <a href=
"ecr__D3D11RenderStateManager.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">D3D11RenderStateManager</span></a>. That class
accumulates all of the render state changes that take place when
preparing an object to be drawn. The manager also maintains a set
of default render states, which an application can override. The
default render states are used for any render state that isn't
explicitly specified for an object. Once all the render states
have been set up and the object is ready to be drawn, the
<a href="ecr__D3D11RenderStateManager.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">D3D11RenderStateManager</span></a> creates the
D3D11 state groups and sets them on the device. This system
allows render states to continue to be treated individually while
preventing problems with stale or undefined render states and
conforming well with the D3D11 API.</p>

<p>Samplers are a special case in render state management, since
shader programs refer to samplers by name, while applications
set the sampler state based on an index. As a result,
the <a href="ecr__D3D11RenderStateManager.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">D3D11RenderStateManager</span></a> will track 
sampler state through index, since it accumulates state immediately
before setting it on the device. However, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"ecr__D3D11RenderStateGroup.htm">D3D11RenderStateGroup</a></span> objects
will track sampler state by name, using <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"ecr__D3D11RenderStateGroup__Sampler.htm">D3D11RenderStateGroup::Sampler</a></span>
objects. The pass is then responsible for mapping the named samplers with the
sampler indices to set on the device. It does this by providing an indexed array
of D3D11RenderStateGroup::Sampler pointers to the <a href="ecr__D3D11RenderStateManager.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">D3D11RenderStateManager</span></a>
using <span class="NDLSystemFont">D3D11RenderStateManager::SetSamplerArray</span>
immediately before updating the render state manager with the render state group.</p>

<p>In the course of rendering with a standard <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiShader.htm">NiShader</a></span> object,
there are a number of places where a render state can be applied.
Here is a rough outline of the order that render states from
various sources are applied (and therefore what priority those
render state sources have, with later states overwriting earlier
states):</p>

<ul>
    <li>Default render states from the <a href=
    "ecr__D3D11RenderStateManager.htm"><span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">D3D11RenderStateManager</span></a></li>

    <li>For shaders using <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">UseNiRenderState</span>, the render states
    from the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiMain/NiProperty.htm">NiProperty</a></span>
    objects on the geometry</li>

    <li>Render states set on the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "ecr__D3D11ShaderCore.htm">D3D11ShaderCore</a></span> object's
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "ecr__D3D11RenderStateGroup.htm">D3D11RenderStateGroup</a></span></li>

    <li>Render states set on the current <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "ecr__D3D11Pass.htm">D3D11Pass</a></span> object's
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "ecr__D3D11RenderStateGroup.htm">D3D11RenderStateGroup</a></span></li>
</ul>
