<h1>Responding to Occluded or Removed Device in D3D11</h1>

<p>The Direct3D device is never lost in D3D11 as it is in DX9,
but it can either become occluded or removed. A device is
occluded if the rendering window is minimized, offscreen, or
entirely covered by another window. In this situation, the D3D11
documentation suggests that the application enter an idle state
and stop rendering. A removed device, on the other hand, is a
condition where the current rendering device is no longer
responding, either because an adapter was shut down or the device
hung for some reason. In this situation, an application needs to
release all D3D11 resources, including the device, and create a
new device before it can continue running.</p>

<h2>Occluded Device</h2>

<p>Gamebryo will automatically check for either an occluded
device or a released device whenever it attempts to render a new
frame (in response to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderer::DisplayFrame</span>). When a device
is occluded, Gamebryo will automatically skip the execution of
all draw calls until the device is no longer occluded. If an
application wants to take further steps to reduce CPU usage while
occluded, it can register a callback function with the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"ecr__D3D11Renderer.htm">D3D11Renderer</a></span> that will be
called when the device first becomes occluded and again when it
becomes no longer occluded.</p>

<p>The callback function has this signature:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">typedef efd::Bool
(*OCCLUDEDNOTIFYFUNC)(efd::Bool beginOccluded, void*
pData);</span></p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">bBeginOccluded</span>
parameter is a Boolean flag that is <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">true</span> when the renderer first learns of the
occlusion, and <span class="NDLSystemFont">false</span> when the
occlusion ends. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">pData</span>
parameter is an optional pointer that an application can register
with the renderer when it registers the callback.</p>

<p>Applications can register functions that match this signature
with the renderer using the function <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ecr::D3D11Renderer::AddOccludedNotificationFunc</span>.
Any number of notification functions may be registered, and the
functions will get called in the order in which they were
registered.</p>

<h2>Removed Device</h2>

<p>A removed device is a much more serious problem, though it
should be fairly rare. Just as with an occluded device,
applications can register a callback so they will be notified
when Gamebryo discovers that the device has been removed.</p>

<p>The callback function has this signature:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">typedef efd::Bool
(*DEVICEREMOVEDNOTIFYFUNC)(void* pData);</span></p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">pData</span> parameter is an
optional pointer that an application can register with the
renderer when it registers the callback.</p>

<p>Applications can register functions that match this signature
with the renderer using the function <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ecr::D3D11Renderer::AddDeviceRemovedNotificationFunc</span>.
Any number of notification functions may be registered, and the
functions will get called in the order in which they were
registered.</p>

<p>When an application does get this message, it has few options.
It can choose to quit, or it can release the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ecr::D3D11Renderer</span> and attempt to create a
new one. Releasing the renderer will require purging all renderer
data in the application, including geometry data, texture data,
shaders, additional swap chains.</p>
