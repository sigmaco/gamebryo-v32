<p class="NDLRefParentage">Type: EXPORT</p>

<p class="NDLRefParentage">Version: 2.0</p>

<p class="NDLRefHeaderFile">&lt;MultiNIFExport.dll&gt;</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Description</p>

<p>The MultiNIfExporter is an export plug-in designed to 
 streamline the art creation process. The MultiNifExporter can save part(s) 
 of the scene graph as individual NIF file(s). Within Max and Maya the 
 artist can tag their scene with special user defined attributes so the 
 exporter knows which parts of the scene graph to save and what options 
 to use when saving. </p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Typical Use Cases</p> 

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Prop Creation </p>

<p>An environment artist is creating buildings and their 
 contents. All of the objects need to have a similar look and scale so 
 the artist is creating them in the same Max/Maya file. By using the same 
 file they can quickly view all of the pieces and see how they look together. 
 Many of the objects need to be saved as separate NIF files so they can 
 be reused for multiple game levels. Under normal circumstances the artist 
 would export each piece separately in a time consuming and error prone 
 process. By using the MultiNifExporter, the artist can tag the individual 
 objects and export all of them at one time. Individual settings like the 
 resulting file name are saved directly in the Max/Maya file. </p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Character Equipment Creation </p>

<p>A character artist can create a character and all of 
 the equipment associated with it in a single Max/Maya file. The character 
 can be modeled with his equipment so everything can be seen together. 
 During the export process the equipment can be saved to separate NIF files 
 so the equipment can be independent of the character file.</p>

    <p class="NDLFigureCaption">Multi-NIF Exporter Options</p>
</div>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Use Object Name as File Name</p>

<p>Selecting this option indicates the object name will 
 be used instead of the name specified in the art package.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Delete After Export</p>

<p>When this is selected the object will be removed from 
 the scene graph after it was exported. In the character example above 
 you would want to delete the character's equipment from the scene graph 
 so just the character would be exported later.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Auto Repair Particle Emitter without Particles</p>

<p>During export it is possible that a particle system's 
 emitter is part of the muti-export but the particle's object is not. The 
 Multi-NIF exporter will attempt to automatically correct this problem 
 by moving the particles to the root of the current export.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Translate, Rotate, Scale</p>

<p>These determine how the transform of the root is handled.
