<p class="NDLRefHead1">Description</p>

<p>This plug-in optimizes the scene graph to reduce memory overhead and traversal time. There are a
myriad of optimization options that can be set for this plug-in. This plug-in <em>must</em> be run
in order for hardware skin partitions and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSkinningLODController.htm">NiSkinningLODController</a></span>
objects to be created properly.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Remove duplicate properties</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Ensures that all duplicate properties in the scene are shared.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class="NDLSystemFont">RemoveDupProperties</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> All material and texturing properties are exported as unique objects, even
if they are the same property in 3ds max or Maya. This function ensures that all identical
properties in the scene are shared to reduce memory overhead. Several other optimization options
will not be as effective if this option is not checked. This optimization option should always be
selected.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Remove bad NiTexturing properties</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Removes <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTexturingProperty</span>
properties with no image data in the scene and those that use a nonexistent set of texture
coordinates.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RemoveBadTexturingProps</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> This function cleans up after some situations that can occur due to the way
the artist manipulates the textures and the way 3ds max exposes the data to the Gamebryo 3ds max
Plug-in. This function is not trying to correct an artist mistake. Instead, it optimizes the
content received from the 3ds max SDK for better performance and to reduce memory overhead. This
optimization option should always be selected.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Remove multi-material nodes</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Removes all multi-material nodes in the scene. Multi-material nodes
are created by some modeling packages to accommodate multiple materials on an object. They are
usually not needed and can be removed.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class="NDLSystemFont">RemoveMultiMtlNodes</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> When a multi-sub object material is used on an object in 3ds max, that
object is split up into multiple objects upon export, one for each material. These multiple objects
are placed under a common parent node, which is given the name "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">__NDL_MultiMtl_Node</span> ". This node has no transforms, controllers, or
properties on it and serves no real purpose other than to indicate that its children used to be a
single object. This optimization function removes all such nodes to reduce object overhead. It
should always be selected.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Remove childless nodes</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Removes all nodes in the scene that have no children.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class="NDLSystemFont">RemoveChildlessNodes</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> Gamebryo only renders leaf objects in the scene graph. A <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span> object has no visible geometry and thus is irrelevant to rendering.
Thus, a node with no children is entirely useless unless specifically reserved for application use
later. To reduce object overhead, this function removes all <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span> objects in the scene that have no children and appear not to be used.
A node can be retained if the string "<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiOptimizeKeep</span>" is placed
in its user-defined properties in 3ds max or in a string property in Maya. A childless node will be
removed even if it has time controllers attached to it. If you want the node to be kept, you must
tag the node with "<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiOptimizeKeep</span>".</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Remove single-child nodes</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Removes all nodes in the scene that have only one child, propagating
any properties, transforms and name to that child. The name will not be propagated if the child has
an "<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiOptimizeKeep</span>" tag.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class="NDLSystemFont">RemoveSingleChildNodes</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> A geometry object in 3ds max or Maya is actually represented internally by a
node with a geometry child. That is what gets exported. Thus, if you create a box named
"<span class="NDLSystemFont">Box01</span>", after exporting you will have an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span> object named "<span class="NDLSystemFont">Box01</span>" with the
transforms of the box. That node will have a single <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> child
named "<span class="NDLSystemFont">Box</span>" with identity transforms. Usually only the geometry
object is needed, since the geometry appears to be a single object in the art tool, so this
optimization function removes these single-child nodes to reduce object overhead. The name,
transforms, and properties of the node are propagated to the child, and the node is removed, with
the child being attached to the node's parent. Thus, after running this function, you will have an
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> object named "<span class="NDLSystemFont">Box01</span>".
If the node has any time controllers attached to it (i.e., it is animated), the node will not be
removed. If the child has an "<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiOptimizeKeep</span>" tag on it, the
name will not be propagated to it.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Merge sibling nodes</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Merges sibling nodes in the scene. Two nodes will be merged if the
following holds: the nodes are sibling nodes, of exact type <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span>, and they have a parent of exact type <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span>, the same properties attached to them, and the same visibility flag.
If two nodes can be merged and have different transforms on them, the transforms for both nodes are
pushed down to their children before they are merged.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class="NDLSystemFont">MergeSiblingNodes</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> Merging sibling nodes, in conjunction with removing single-child nodes and
merging sibling <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> objects, can allow more <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> objects to be merged than would be otherwise. The fewer objects in
the scene and the more triangles per <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> object, the faster
the run-time performance will be.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Merge sibling NiMesh objects</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Merges all sibling <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> objects
in the scene. Two <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> objects can be merged if the following
holds: they have a common parent of exact type <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span>, the same
material, the same number of properties, the same set of property pointers, the same number of
texture sets, the exact same extra data set, no time controllers attached, no cloned data streams,
and the same <span class="NDLSystemFont">AppCulled</span> flag value.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class="NDLSystemFont">MergeSiblingMeshes</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> This function merges sibling <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span>
objects to reduce object overhead. Its effectiveness is vastly reduced if duplicate properties and
single-child nodes are not removed and sibling nodes are not merged.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Do not merge alpha-blended objects</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> If this option is checked, merging does not occur below nodes with an
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAlphaProperty</span> attached when alpha blending is enabled or
sorters are allowed.</p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> Merging two <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> objects that are
intended to be sorted by an alpha sorter may cause the sorter to be unable to correctly order the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> objects when rendering. This situation should be avoided,
but it can be allowed by un-checking this option.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Remove extra texture coordinate sets</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Removes all texture coordinate sets from geometry in the scene that
are not used by any <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTexturingProperty</span> attached to the current
or a higher node.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class="NDLSystemFont">RemoveExtraUVSets</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> This option removes any texture coordinate sets that do not have a texture
associated with them, which saves memory. In 3ds max and Maya it is easy to accidentally generate
unneeded UV sets. However, this option should not be checked if your application is applying
textures through code, using a dynamic reflection, procedural texture, or other such effect.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Remove unnecessary colors</p>

<p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Function Performed:</b> Recursively removes colors that are not
needed.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RemoveUnnecessaryColorSets</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> A color set is removed from every object when the following is true: the
object is not a particle system, contains a vertex color property with a source mode that is not
emissive or if the properties source mode is ambient and diffuse and the lighting mode is not
emissive, ambient, and diffuse.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Remove unnecessary normals</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Recursively removes normals that are not needed. Will <em>not</em>
remove normals from scenes without lights.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RemoveUnnecessaryNormals</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> Normals are removed from every object when the following is true: the object
has an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTexturingProperty</span> attached that has a base map and an
apply mode of <span class="NDLSystemFont">APPLY_REPLACE</span>, or the object has an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVertexColorProperty</span> attached whose lighting mode is emissive. This
optimization option should always be selected.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Remove unnecessary NiVisControllers</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Removes all <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVisController</span>s in
the scene whose keys all have the same visibility data, updating the visibility flag of their
targets.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RemoveUnnecessaryVisControllers</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> If a <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVisController</span> has the same
visibility data for all its keys, it does not need to exist. This function removes the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisController</span> in this situation. This situation can occur quite easily in
3ds max and Maya and is not always due to artist error. This optimization option should always be
selected.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Optimize NiMesh objects</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Removes degenerate triangles, collapses vertices, re-orders
triangles, and tries to optimize for the hardware vertex cache for all <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> objects in the scene, deleting them if all their triangles are
degenerate.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class="NDLSystemFont">OptimizeMeshes</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> The primary aim of this optimization is to improve rendering performance
through data re-ordering. The removal of degenerate triangles and collapsing of vertices should not
be required in datasets exported from 3ds max or Maya. However, after merging <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> objects or on modified datasets, it can be useful. Meshes for which
data re-ordering is not allowed, such as morphed geometry, will not be modified. There is no harm
in leaving this option turned on at all times to ensure optimized <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> data.</p>

<p>Triangle re-ordering optimization sorts the index buffers to optimize the mesh in a generic view
independent way for better intra-object Z-buffer rejection using three assumptions. First, larger
triangles are more likely to occlude smaller triangles and should come first in the mesh. Second,
outward facing triangles from the center of the mesh are more likely to provide occlusion on
concave meshes. Third, triangles further from the center are more likely to occlude than those near
the center. Re-ordering is not done for triangle strip objects. The <em>Size Weight</em>,
<em>Direction Weight</em>, and <em>Position Weight</em> values control the relative weight given to
each of the three criteria. Higher values make that criteria more important in determining
rendering order, while a value of 0 means that criteria is ignored. If the "NiNoOptimizeMesh" tag
is added to the object the re-ordering will not be performed. This is important if you need to
maintain the triangle order given by the DCC application.</p>

<p>Vertex cache optimization tries to re-order triangles so that vertices are re-used before they
are removed from the hardware vertex cache. The size of the simulated cache can be adjusted to tune
performance. The size is relative to the actual hardware cache size. If the "NiNoOptimizeMesh" tag
is added to the object the re-ordering will not be performed. This is important if you need to
maintain the triangle order given by the DCC application.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Remove hidden bone geometry</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Removes any <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span> object
in the scene that is a child of a bone and whose <span class="NDLSystemFont">AppCulled</span> flag
is true.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RemoveHiddenBoneGeometry</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> A bone is defined as an object that is pointed to by the bone array of a
skinned <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> object in the scene graph. This function removes
any <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span> child of a bone whose <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AppCulled</span> flag is <span class="NDLSystemFont">true</span> (i.e., that is
hidden), without exception.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Remove unnecessary NiLookAtControllers</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Removes <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiLookAtInterpolator</span>
objects and their associated controllers in the scene if there are no <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiKeyframeController</span> objects on either the target or the "Look At" of the
controller or above them in the scene graph.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RemoveUnnecessaryLookAtControllers</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> An <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTransformController</span> with an
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiLookAtInterpolator</span> changes the orientation of its target to
always face a particular "Look At" object. If there are no <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTransformController</span> objects attached above either the target or the "Look
At" in the scene graph, the original controller is not necessary since nothing will ever move. This
function removes the controller in this situation.</p>

<p>One way in which this situation might occur is if a target camera is used, but neither the
camera nor the target is animated. This optimization option should typically be selected, but might
need to be un-checked if there are objects that are moved by physics or some other non-keyframe
controller based method.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Reduce animation keys</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Reduces redundant animation keys for all <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiKeyframeController</span>s in the scene. The tolerance specifies a ratio of how
far off a key is allowed to be from an interpolation between the two keys on either side of it to
still be considered redundant.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class="NDLSystemFont">ReduceAnimationKeys</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> Since both 3ds max and Maya produce copious amounts of keyframes in certain
cases (Maya when "baking" IK animations and 3ds max when sampling keyframes), this function can be
essential in removing duplicate keyframes. It should be turned on unless there is a specific reason
why redundant animation keys should not be removed.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Remove unnecessary extra data</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Removes extra data strings that are empty or that contain only
strings used for temporary conversion purposes. If the <em>Remove "NiOptimizeKeep" tags</em> option
is checked, extra data objects that contain the strings "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiOptimizeKeep</span>" and "<span class="NDLSystemFont">sgoKeep</span>" are also
removed.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RemoveUnnecessaryExtraData</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> These strings are removed to free memory. There is no other reason why they
need to be removed.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Sort children of each node by NiTexturingProperty</p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Sorts all the children of each node in the scene by the address of
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTexturingProperty</span> present in their property states.
Children with no <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTexturingProperty</span> objects in their property
state are sorted first.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class="NDLSystemFont">SortByTexturingProp</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> This function helps somewhat with increasing rendering efficiency. However,
the constraints of maintaining the structure of the scene graph limit how optimized it can be.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Object Names</p>

<h3>Remove all object names</h3>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Removes the name string from every object and material property in
the scene.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class="NDLSystemFont">RemoveNames</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> This function is provided in case names are not needed by an application.
Removing the names can slightly reduce the memory overhead but will cause problems with some
classes such as <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerManager</span> that relies on the presence
of object names. You should only remove names if you are positive they are not needed.</p>

<h3>Remove object partial path names</h3>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Removes the partial path from the name string on every object in the
scene.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class="NDLSystemFont">RemovePartialPaths</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> This function is provided in case unique names are not needed by an
application. Removing the partial path from the name can slightly reduce the memory overhead.</p>

<h3>Name all unnamed objects</h3>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Adds unique names to all objects that are unnamed in the scene.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class="NDLSystemFont">NameUnnamedObjects</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> This function prevents any objects from being exported with no name. This
option is provided in case an application requires that all objects have names.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Skin and Bones Support</p>

<p><b>Weld hardware skin partitions</b></p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Elimination of cracks in skinned models.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class="NDLSystemFont">WeldSkin</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> The limited number of bones that can be active when using
hardware-accelerated skinning creates the need to ignore certain bone-vertex interactions when the
data structures used for hardware-accelerated skinning are created. This can cause cracks to appear
on edges shared by triangles in different Gamebryo objects if a bone's influence is ignored in one
triangle but not ignored by an adjacent triangle in a different Gamebryo object. The welding code
identifies edges where such cracks have been created and eliminates them. In order for this welding
to occur, the two objects must have identical world transforms.</p>

<p><b>Hardware/Software/Both</b></p>

<p><b>Function Performed:</b> Specifies the settings for exporting skinning information.</p>

<p><b>NiOptimize Function Called:</b> <span class="NDLSystemFont">OptimizeSkinData</span></p>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> These options specify what type of skinning information to export for each
platform. You have the option to export information for hardware skinning, software skinning, or
both. Datasets exported with only information for hardware skinning will not run on graphics
hardware that does not support hardware skinning. Datasets exported with both hardware and software
skinning information will be hardware accelerated when possible, but can still run on graphics
hardware that does not support hardware skinning. You can also specify the number of bones per skin
partition here. Meshes that are used as an instance by the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshHWInstance.htm">NiMeshHWInstance</a></span> can not be hardware
skinned. If this is encountered the mesh will remain skinned in software.</p>
