<p class="NDLRefHead1">Editing the User Interface for the Plug-in
Viewer</p>

<p>In the Gamebryo 1.0 release, the Gamebryo 3ds max Plug-in and
the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in viewers were completely rewritten from
previous releases.</p>

<p>The two plug-in viewers now share a common interface with
greatly extended capabilities. Of course, with greater
functionality comes greater complexity. This section details the
new features of the editable user interface and how to create and
edit user interfaces. Note that some default interface
configurations ship with the plug-ins for users who choose not to
define their own interface.</p>

<h3>Terminology:</h3>

<p>This document will use specific terms to describe parts of the
user interface system.</p>

<p><b>Command:</b> An action that is applied in some way to the
scene graph or to a specific object in the scene graph.</p>

<p><b>Mapping:</b>A pairing between a keyboard button, mouse
button, gamepad button, or analog stick and a command to be
executed. Pressing the associated button or stick triggers the
command.</p>

<p><b>Primary Input:</b> The main button or stick that is used to
trigger a mapping. Examples of a primary input are the left mouse
button, keyboard button A, or the first analog stick.</p>

<p><b>Modifier Input:</b> The modifier button or buttons that are
used in mapping a command. Examples of these kinds of buttons
might be the keyboard button Control or the gamepad Start
button.</p>

<p><b>Parameters:</b> The set of options that adjust how a
command is executed. An example of a parameter would be the angle
in degrees that the user wishes to rotate.</p>

<p><b>Priority:</b>A value that determines when one command is
executed over than another command. This value is used when two
commands have the same primary input in their mapping. The
command with the highest priority will be executed and the other
command is ignored. If commands share the same priority value and
primary input, both commands are executed. In this way, the
system can support multiple commands with one button press. In
practice, it is a good rule of thumb to have the priority be
equal to the number of modifiers applied to the primary input.
For instance, Control + Alt + Shift + Left Mouse Button would
have a priority of 3, while Left Mouse Button would have a
priority of 0.</p>

<p><b>Event Type:</b> This term describes when and how often a
command is executed when its mapping is triggered. There are five
primary event types: NOT_PRESSED, SINGLE, CONTINUOUS, RELEASED,
and DOUBLE-CLICK.</p>

<ul>
    <li>NOT_PRESSED will execute a command as long as the input
    sequence is not being pressed. In practice, this option
    should be rarely used.</li>

    <li>SINGLE will execute a command the first time a sequence
    is pressed and can only be triggered again once the input
    sequence has been released. This event type is useful for
    commands that only need to be generated once, like toggling
    the wireframe mode or animation mode.</li>

    <li>CONTINUOUS will execute a command continuously as long as
    the sequence is pressed. This event type is useful for
    command that require constant user input like translating,
    tumbling, or rotating the camera.</li>

    <li>RELEASED will execute a command once when the input
    sequence is released and can only be triggered by pressing
    and releasing the input sequence again. This event type can
    be used in any case where SINGLE is used.</li>

    <li>DOUBLE-CLICK will execute a command once each time the
    input sequence is pressed twice within a specific time
    threshold. This event type can be used in any case where
    SINGLE is used.</li>
</ul>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Plug-in Viewer Commands</p>

<p>The commands used by the system can be divided into three
categories: Camera Manipulation, Scene Manipulation, and User
Interface Manipulation.</p>

            that tumbling only works for cameras located at the
            root of the scene graph. Typically, this requirement

<a name="DefaultUserInterfaces" id="DefaultUserInterfaces"></a><p class="NDLRefHead1">The Plug-in Viewer Default User
Interfaces</p>

<p>The Gamebryo Maya Plug-in and the Gamebryo 3ds max Plug-in
ship with two different user interfaces: Gamebryo Defaults and
First-Person Shooter. For 3ds max, these user interfaces and any
other user interfaces are stored in UIM files in the
plugins\MaxImmerse folder of the users 3ds max installation. For
Maya, these user interfaces are stored in UIM files in the
bin\plugins folder of the users Maya installation.</p>

<p>For 3ds max, user interfaces can be changed in the Viewer
Selection rollout when you view the Gamebryo Max Plug-in utility
from the Utilities tab of the Max Command Panel.</p>

<p>For Maya, the user interface must be named InputMap.uim. To
edit the user interface settings, make a backup of InputMap.uim,
and then edit the file with the ConfigurableUIMapEditor
program.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Gamebryo Defaults User Interface</p>

<p>This user interface was designed to focus on the arrow keys
and number pad. The Control key is used consistently as the
modifier key to keep the right hand focused on the number pad,
arrow keys, or mouse. ESC closes the window.</p>

<a name="ConfigurableUIMapEditor" id="ConfigurableUIMapEditor"></a><p class="NDLRefHead1">The Configurable UI Map Editor</p>

<p>The Configurable UI Map Editor dialog is designed to allow
users to create an interface that best fits their needs.</p>

<p>The dialog consists of two text fields and a tabbed panel. 
The text field entitled Current displays the path to the UIM file
that is currently being edited. The User Defined UI Map text
field displays the descriptive name of the user interface.</p>

<p>The tabbed panel has two tabs: Mouse and Keyboard. The
Keyboard tab is selected in the image below. Each row represents
a different command mapping for the keyboard. Each command
mapping is sorted by its priority. See the introduction, Editing
the User Interface for the Viewer, for a description of
priority. The left column of the table is the User-Defined
Command Name. The second column represents the input sequence
necessary to trigger that mapping.</p>

<p>New commands can be added through the Simple Add or Advanced
Add buttons. Simple Add uses a set of predefined user commands
that handle commonly used situations. Advanced Add provides
users with a greater level of control over their interface.</p>

<p>Existing commands can be edited by either pressing the Record
button or Edit button. The Record button will bring up the
appropriate devices record dialog. The Edit button brings up the
Advanced Add dialog with all of the values filled out according
to the command that is to be edited.</p>

<p>Individual commands can be removed by pressing Remove. All
commands for the given device can be removed through the Remove
All button.</p>

<p>Saving the user-interface can be performed through the File
menu or upon pressing OK. Make sure that the UIM is saved in the
plugins\MaxImmerse folder of the users 3ds max installation. For
Maya, the active UIM must be named InputMap.uim and saved in the
bin/plugins folder of the users Maya installation.</p>

<p>The record dialog is different for each input device. The
image below displays the Mouse Input Capture dialog and lists the
most complicated combination of buttons and keystrokes that can
be created for the mouse. Each button is cumulative, so combos
do not need to be performed simultaneously. Reset clears the
input sequence. Accept will store the input sequence in the
command mapping.</p>

<p>Each dialog will show the appropriate modifiers and primary
inputs for the current device.</p>

<p>The Simple Add Dialog contains a list of predefined commands

<p>This dialog, which appears below, contains all information
necessary to create and edit a command mapping for the new user
interface system. It is divided into five groupings: Command
Settings, Input Device Settings, Priority Settings, Event Type
Settings, and Parameters that describe particular aspects of the
command mapping.</p>

<p>The OK button will not be enabled until the user has
completely filled out all of the settings for the dialog box.</p>

<p>Note: The Advanced Add and Edit dialogs are exactly the same,
except the Edit dialog contains all of the previously defined
information about the command.</p>

<p><b>Command Settings:</b> This grouping describes the command
type from the Commands list and the descriptive user name of this
command mapping. The User Name determines what name the mapping
will appear under in the root dialog. Once a command type is
selected, the parameter panel is populated with all of the
parameters for that command type.</p>

<p><b>Input Device Settings:</b> This grouping describes the
input sequence necessary to trigger the creation of this command.
The appropriate record dialog for the current input device is
created when the user presses the Record button.</p>

<p><b>Priority Settings:</b> This grouping describes the priority
value of the current command mapping. A priority is a value that
determines when one command is executed over than another
command. This value is used when two commands have the same
primary input in their mapping. The command with the highest
priority will be executed and the other command is ignored. If
commands share the same priority value and primary input, both
commands are executed. In this way, the system can support
multiple commands with one button press. In practice, it is a
good rule of thumb to have the priority be equal to the number of
modifiers applied to the primary input. For instance, Control +
Alt + Shift + Left Mouse Button would have a priority of 3, while
Left Mouse Button would have a priority of 0.</p>

<p><b>Event Type Settings:</b> This grouping describes when and
how often a command mapping is executed. There are five primary
event types:</p>

<ul>
    <li>NOT_PRESSED will execute a command as long as the input
    sequence is not being pressed. In practice, this option
    should be rarely used.</li>

    <li>SINGLE will execute a command the first time a sequence
    is pressed and can only be triggered again once the input
    sequence has been released. This event type is useful for
    commands that only need to be generated once, like toggling
    the wireframe mode or animation mode.</li>

    <li>CONTINUOUS will execute a command continuously as long as
    the sequence is pressed. This event type is useful for
    command that require constant user input like translating,
    tumbling, or rotating the camera.</li>

    <li>RELEASED will execute a command once when the input
    sequence is released and can only be triggered by pressing
    and releasing the input sequence again. This event type can
    be used in any case where SINGLE is used.</li>

    <li>DOUBLE-CLICK will execute a command once each time the
    input sequence is pressed twice within a specific time
    threshold. This event type can be used in any case where
    SINGLE is used.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Parameters:</b> This grouping describes the set of options
that adjust how a command is executed. Each parameter is listed
in the list box. The first column describes the purpose of the
parameter. The second column describes the value of the
parameter. The third column describes what user interface
component affects the value of the parameter. For instance,
movement of the mouse forwards and backwards could be attached to
the Look Up\Down parameter. The values for the Value and Attached
to can be edited by selecting the parameter and pressing the Edit
button. This step will bring up the Edit Parameter dialog that
will enable the user to have full editing capability over the
parameter.</p>
