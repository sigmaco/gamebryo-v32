<p class="NDLRefHead1">Description</p>

<p>This plug-in is Gamebryo's Save Source Texture Renderer Data
process plug-in.</p>

<p>The goal of this plug-in is to perform platform-specific
texture format conversions at export time. In this way, a
specific platform can see both:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Improvements in "high water mark" behavior for texture
    memory at load time. In other words, temporary memory
    allocations for texture format conversion will not be
    required if a platform-specific export option is requested in
    the art pipeline.</li>

    <li>Load time performance improvements, due to no texture
    format conversions at load time.</li>
</ul>

<p>During processing as part of an export operation, this plug-in
converts source texture (or source cube map) pixel data in the
shared data of the plug-in system and creates streamable
persistent source texture (or source cube map) renderer data,
which is subsequently streamed out for the final NIF file. With
this approach, platform-specific source texture renderer data may
be loaded directly into platform renderer-specific resources at
application load time, without temporary memory allocations for
conversion, and without time spent doing conversions at load
time.</p>

<p>A caveat to this approach is that the texture is configured
specifically for a target platform (and/or graphics card), and
may not be loadable for use with alternative platforms or with
tools on the PC. In such cases, <a href=
"../../Programmer/Texturing/Failures.htm">"error" replacement
textures</a> are used to indicate the error.</p>

<p>[Note that each time a platform SDK (e.g., Xbox360 XDK,
Playstation3 SDK, or Revolution SDK) changes, there is at least a
possibility that the new SDK will cause textures to be formatted
differently on that platform. It is not likely to happen
frequently, but the possibility exists. In such a case, it may be
desirable to re-export Nifs containing platform-specific textures
using exporters built with that platform's most recent SDK
version.]</p>

<p>See also the description of <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData.htm">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</a>
in the Main Class Reference for more details.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Options</p>

<p>There are no options for this plug-in.</p>

<p>However, with the Gamebryo Xenon SDK, an additional Gamebryo
ToolLibs DLL, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../ee_goto.htm#Reference/NiXbox360ImageTiler/NiXbox360ImageTiler.htm">
NiXbox360ImageTiler</a></span>.DLL, is used. That DLL
automatically performs Xenon-specific texture tiling during art
asset export. Such a step prepares for loading tiled Xenon
textures directly at application load time. If that DLL is not
present, then Xenon texture tiling is not done.</p>
