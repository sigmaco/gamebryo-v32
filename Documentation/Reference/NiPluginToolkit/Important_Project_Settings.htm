<h1>Important Project Settings</h1>

<p>Guidelines for project settings for any Gamebryo application for both Visual
Studio 2005 (VC80) and Visual Studio 2008 (VC90) are detailed in <a href=
"../../GetStart/PC/Introduction.htm">Getting Started with Gamebryo for PC</a>.
Those settings should be set along with the new settings required by the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPluginToolkit</span> which are summarized below,
grouped by the associated project configuration options heading. These options
are the same for both VC80 and VC90. The only difference is that if you are
developing for VC90, then instructions that use the VC80 directory should
always instead use the VC90 directory, such as in the library path or the
post-build step.</p>

<h2>C/C++</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Under the "Preprocessor" category, the following preprocessor
    definition should be included: <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NIPLUGINDLL_EXPORT</span>. You will also need import
    definitions for any Gamebryo DLLs you will be using (e.g., if you are using
    the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAnimation</span> DLL, you will need to
    specify <span class="NDLSystemFont">NIANIMATION_IMPORT</span>). Also,
    "Additional include directories" should include the path to the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">$(EMERGENT_PATH)\sdk\Win32\Include</span>
    directory on your hard disk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Linker</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Under the "General" category, "Output File" should have an extension of
    "<span class="NDLSystemFont">.dld</span>" for debug builds and
    "<span class="NDLSystemFont">.dll</span>" for release builds.</li>

    <li>Under the "Input" category, "Additional Library Path" should include
    the path to the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">$(EMERGENT_PATH)\sdk\Win32\Lib\VC80\DebugDLL</span>
    directory for debug builds and the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">$(EMERGENT_PATH)\sdk\Win32\Lib\VC80\ReleaseDLL</span>
    directory for release builds.</li>

    <li>You must minimally link with the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiPluginToolkit</span> library file (the name will be the
    same as the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPluginToolkit*.dll</span> except
    with a ".<span class="NDLSystemFont">lib</span>" extension). If you are
    using any of the shared data objects in the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiStandardSharedData*.dll</span>, you must include that
    corresponding *.lib file, as well.</li>

    <li>If you are using Gamebryo DLLs at all in your plug-in, you must include
    their corresponding *.lib files. At the least, you should include the
    NiMain.lib and NiSystem.lib files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Post-build Step</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>The final plug-in DLL must reside in the default location:</p>

        <p><span class=
        "NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\SDK\Win32\DLL\ToolPlugins\VC#</span></p>

        <p>...where "<span class="NDLSystemFont">VC#</span>" is "<span class=
        "NDLSystemFont">VC80</span>"for libraries built under Visual Studio
        2005.</p>

        <p>It is a good idea to set up a post-build step to copy the built
        plug-in DLL to this directory. A sample post-build step to accomplish
        this step is listed below:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>For debug builds in Visual Studio 2005:

                <ul>
                    <li>copy "$(OutDir)\*.dld"
                    "%EMERGENT_PATH%\SDK\Win32\DLL\ToolPlugins\VC80"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>For release builds in Visual Studio 2005:

                <ul>
                    <li>copy "$(OutDir)\*.dll"
                    "%EMERGENT_PATH%\SDK\Win32\DLL\ToolPlugins\VC80"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Feeding Your Plug-in from 3ds Max</h2>

<p>There are two methods for getting data entered by artists in 3ds max: custom
attributes and the user-defined property buffer. Please see the Adding Custom
Content section of the Programmer's Guide for more information.</p>

<h2>Feeding Your Plug-in from Maya</h2>

<p>Maya uses a powerful "Extra Attribute" system that the artist can use to
embed information into the scene. This system enables you to export integers,
floats, Booleans, strings, enums, and a host of other data types. This
technique is the same one used by the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in to embed
information into the scene graph that is later removed before export. This
approach is used when creating <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSwitchNode</span>s, billboards, alternate bounding volumes,
and much more. You can further simplify the process by automatically creating
your "Extra Attributes" using one of Maya's shelf icons, as the Gamebryo Maya
Plug-in does. Simply click the icon, and it is all accomplished through Maya's
MEL script.</p>

<h3>Creating shelf buttons in Maya</h3>

<p>If you look at "MyImmerseShelf.mel" you can see where the Gamebryo Maya
Plug-in creates all of its shelf buttons. The "shelfButton" command does all of
the work and runs a MEL script when you click the icon.</p>

<h3>An example of MEL script adding attributes in Maya</h3>

<p>If you look at "MyImmerseCreateAnimationLoopingControls.mel" you will see a
script that adds attributes to all of the objects you have selected.</p>
