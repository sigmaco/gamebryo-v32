<p class="NDLRefHead1">Description</p>

<p>This class is the entry point into the dynamic collision 
 detection system.&nbsp; The class allows an application to group together 
 objects that will interact.&nbsp; It also allows the application to either 
 test if objects in the group intersect or find the actual intersections 
 of objects in the group.&nbsp; Information stored in the collision group 
 is propagated through the scene graph while testing/finding collisions 
 and is also used by <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span> 
 objects for creating and traversing oriented bounding box trees.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Moving and/or animating objects that might 
 strike collidees are added and removed from the collision group via these 
 member functions.&nbsp; By default, collision data will be created, however, 
 if the scene graph is known to contain all the collision data needed, 
 this value should be set to <span class="NDLSystemFont">false</span>.&nbsp; 
 Typically, an object with an <a href="Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a> 
 exported out of one of the Gamebryo exporters will contain all the necessary 
 data for collision detection. </p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Note that the addition of trees of colliders 
 is supported and encouraged, as long as all of the objects within the 
 tree should be treated as colliders, self-intersections are not important 
 and the individual colliders tend to remain near each other (such as is 
 the case with an animated character). </p>

 Also, animating objects that will never strike other collidees (such as 
 trees blowing in the wind, or objects that move via a pre-defined script) 
 should be added as well.&nbsp; Adding trees of objects as collidees is 
 especially beneficial here, as collision testing will be culled if higher-level 
 bounds find no collision is possible.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Notes</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Colliders and Collidees</p>

<p>A collider is an object that the application intends 
 to move around in the world.&nbsp; While, in many cases, such objects 
 are assigned nonzero velocities via the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCollisionData::SetLocalVelocity</span> member function, they may have zero velocities.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For example, an object which initially has a nonzero 
 velocity and which may eventually stop is considered a collider even when 
 it is at rest.</p>

<p>A collidee is an object that must remain stationary 
 in the world while it is a member of an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCollisionGroup</span>.</p>

<p>For example, walls in a room are typically added to 
 a collision group as collidees.&nbsp; While a collidee must remain stationary 
 when a member of a collision group, it is okay to remove that object from 
 the collision group, move it to another world location, and then add it 
 to another collision group.&nbsp; As mentioned above, objects that are 
 animating or moving along paths that guarantee no collisions with other 
 collidees can also be treated as collidees.&nbsp; The local velocity for 
 collidees is ignored by the collision detection system.&nbsp; Collidees 
 are less computationally expensive than colliders, as colliders must be 
 checked against each other every time the collision system is called, 
 as well as against all collidees.&nbsp; Collidees need not be checked 
 against each other.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Testing for Collisions</p>

<p>Tests for collisions do not use the collision callbacks 
 for objects.&nbsp; The function merely reports if an intersection will 
 occur in the specified time slice between some pair of objects.&nbsp; 
 The intersecting objects themselves remain unidentified.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Finding Collisions</p>

<p>Each collision callback is provided with pointers to 
 the two colliding objects in the group and the predicted values for the 
 intersection time, the point of intersection, and the normal vectors for 
 the object triangles involved in the collision.&nbsp; This information 
 is stored in the nested class <span class="NDLSystemFont">Intersect</span><b>.&nbsp; 
 </b>The prototype for the callback is <span class="NDLSystemFont">int(*Callback)(Intersect&amp;)</span>.</p>

<p>A callback and user-specified data to be used by the 
 callback are set by the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCollisionData::SetCollisionCallback</span></li>
  <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCollisionData::SetCollisionCallbackData</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The local velocity for an object is set by <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCollisionData::SetLocalVelocity</span>.</p>

<p>As indicated, the Intersect class has two pointer members 
 which point to the two colliding objects that were added to the group.&nbsp; 
 The member <span class="NDLSystemFont">pkRoot0</span> 
 happens to be the pointer to the object that called the callback.&nbsp; 
 Additionally, the actual objects within the roots' (potential) hierarchies 
 will also be specified by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">pkObj0</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">pkObj1</span> class members, 
 each of whom has no definite relation to the roots other than the fact 
 that one of the roots is its ancestor. See <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiCollisionGroup__Intersect.htm">NiCollisionGroup::Intersect</a></span> 
 for more details.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Nested Class Record</p>

<p>The nested class <span class="NDLSystemFont">Record</span> is publicly declared only because <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCollisionGroup</span> must call the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCollisionTraversals::TestCollisions</span></li>
  <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCollisionTraversals::FindCollisions</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Members of this type are not intended for use by the 
 application.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Maximum Depth and Bin Size Parameters</p>

<p>The maximum depth parameter specifies at what level 
 in the oriented bounding box tree the collision testing should terminate.&nbsp; 
 The default value indicates that the oriented bounding box tree should 
 be traversed all the way to its leaf nodes.&nbsp; The larger the maximum 
 depth, the more accurate the intersection results.&nbsp; The bin size 
 parameter specifies how many triangles should occur per leaf node in the 
 oriented bounding box tree.&nbsp; The default value indicates that a full 
 oriented bounding box tree should be built (one triangle per leaf node).&nbsp; 
 The smaller the bin size, the more accurate the intersection results.&nbsp; 
 Both maximum depth and bin size can be tuned by an application to get 
 the optimal tradeoff of speed versus accuracy.</p>
