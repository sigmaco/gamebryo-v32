<h1>Pass A Reasonable Time Into Dynamic Collision Detection</h1>

<p>As described previously, bounding volumes are projected
 forward in time along their linear velocities in order to determine all the
 potential collisions that could occur before the next frame is rendered,
 preventing objects from passing through each other. Since it is the
 application's responsibility to actually move the objects, it also needs to
 inform the collision system whenever it changes the velocity of moving
 objects, such as ones under the influence of gravity, or those who have
 rebounded from collisions. In order to ensure that collision will not be
 missed for rapidly accelerating objects, the application might set the
 velocity to that expected at the <em>end</em> of the frame, as the linear
 approximation used by collision would then be assured of capturing the entire
 potential range of motion.</p>

</div>

<p>As an example, in the figure above, a ball is moving
 upwards towards the green walls from y<sub>0</sub> to y<sub>1</sub>, with a
 fairly uniform acceleration (indicated by the changing velocity depicted by
 the curved blue line).&nbsp;  At frame i, the ball is moving at a rate of
 about 1 unit of distance per frame.&nbsp; At frame i+1, the ball is moving at
 about 5 units per frame.&nbsp;  If we passed the collision system
 v<sub>i</sub>, it would predict movement to p<sub>i</sub>, which would miss
 the collision with the wall.&nbsp;  If we passed it v<sub> i+1</sub>, on the
 other hand, predicting movement to p<sub> i+1</sub>, it would not be as
 efficient, as it would detect a second (false) collision with the second wall
 during this frame.  However in this situation it would accurately determine
 the first wall collision, and the ball would not pass through the first
 wall.</p>

<p>The time passed in to the collision system may need to be
 chosen carefully to ensure accurate collision detection and avoid impacting
 performance.&nbsp;  If a game is operating at a constant frame rate, and
 changing velocities are handled as described above, then the ideal time to
 pass the collision system during a
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">FindCollisions</span> would be
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">1.0/fps</span>, if we were
 calling the collision system every frame (not recommended&mdash;see discussion
 below).</p>

<p>However, since frame rates vary, the framerate of the last
 frame is not necessarily safe to use, so some application-specific factor
 (perhaps variable) will need to be determined.&nbsp;  Obviously, if the
 number submitted is too low, future collisions will be missed, as in the 
 velocity discussion above, and penetrations might occur.&nbsp;  If the number
 submitted is too high, then a large number of collisions might be
 detected.&nbsp;  The effect of passing in too large a time value can snowball
 even further as the larger period can increase the number of potential
 collisions that are detected thereby lowering frame rates further and forcing
 the use of even larger time values (<span class="NDLSystemFont">1.0/fps</span> increases as framerate decreases).</p>
