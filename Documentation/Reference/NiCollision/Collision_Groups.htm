<h1>Collision Groups</h1>

<p><!--kadov_tag{{<ignored>}}-->Gamebryo<!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 provides collision groups to help handle the <a href="Broad_and_Narrow_Phase.htm">broad 
 phase</a> component of collision detection. Collision groups enable the 
 application programmer to organize which objects have the possibility 
 of colliding. Only objects within a given collision group can collide 
 against one another (though, the same object could be found across multiple 
 collision groups).</p>

<p>Furthermore, within a collision group, objects may be 
 sub-grouped as either &quot;<!--kadov_tag{{<ignored>}}-->colliders<!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}-->&quot; 
 or &quot;<!--kadov_tag{{<ignored>}}-->collidees<!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}-->&quot;. 
 The distinction is that <!--kadov_tag{{<ignored>}}-->colliders<!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 may be expected to move, but <!--kadov_tag{{<ignored>}}-->collidees<!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 are not. Whenever an object is added as a <!--kadov_tag{{<ignored>}}-->collidee<!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}-->, 
 it is ensured that it will never be tested against any other <!--kadov_tag{{<ignored>}}-->collidee<!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}-->. 
 Adding objects as collidees reduces the total number of collision tests 
 significantly, especially since most applications have a large number 
 of collidees and a small number of colliders in the scene at any time. 
 In addition, most, if not all, of the collidees do not need to be updated, 
 since they do not move, after an initial update.</p>

<p>Objects should always be added as <!--kadov_tag{{<ignored>}}-->collidees<!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 whenever possible. Using domain specific knowledge, even moving objects 
 can be added (objects on a path, animated trees, etc.) as <!--kadov_tag{{<ignored>}}-->collidees<!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 if you are careful with the assumptions that are made.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that if a root of some tree is 
 added to a collision group, then all objects of the tree will be tested 
 recursively for collisions, subject to certain propagation flags, which 
 will be discussed later. So a complicated tree of bones might describe 
 two characters, but the individual bones would not have to be added to 
 the collision group, only the roots of each of these character trees.</p>

<p>In <!--kadov_tag{{<ignored>}}-->Gamebryo<!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}-->, 
 collision groups are implemented by the class <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiCollisionGroup.htm"><!--kadov_tag{{<ignored>}}-->NiCollisionGroup<!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--></a></span>. 
 Most applications will make at least one instance of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiCollisionGroup.htm">NiCollisionGroup</a></span>. 
 Advanced users may provide there own broad phase solution by either bypassing 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiCollisionGroup.htm">NiCollisionGroup</a></span> 
 or combining it with a multiple group solution. </p>

<p>With Gamebryo collision groups, it is only necessary 
 to make one collision call (per group) as the group handles collisions 
 among the objects in that group. See <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiCollisionGroup.htm">NiCollisionGroup</a></span> 
 for more information.</p>

<p>A few examples can reveal the importance of limiting 
 as many collisions from consideration as possible, using these grouping 
 mechanisms.</p>

<h2>An Example of 10X Performance Via Collidees</h2>

<p>Consider a case of 100 objects that can participate 
 in collisions with other objects. If you organize all these objects in 
 one collision group as colliders, then you would experience 4950 (= 99 
 + 98 + 97 + ... + 1) unique object-object collision tests for each collision 
 time-span (which could be per frame). Also, there may be propagation down 
 the respective scene graph sub-trees, depending on the propagation behavior.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if 5 of the objects are moving (e.g., 
 characters) and the remaining 95 objects are non-moving (e.g., fixtures, 
 trees, walls), then you may identify 5 of the objects as colliders and 
 the remaining 95 objects as collidees. Then you would experience 485 (= 
 99 + 98 + 97 + 96 + 95) unique object-object collision tests for each 
 collision time-span, which, in this specific case, is a performance improvement 
 of greater than 10:1.</p>

<h2>An Example of 5X Performance Via Collision Groups</h2>

<p>Additionally, you may be able to use multiple collision 
 groups to segregate collision testing and further minimize unnecessary 
 collision tests. (With this approach, you may also be able to spread collision 
 detection across several frames by processing different collision groups 
 in different frames.)</p>

<p>As an example, assume you're able to extend the above 
 example by organizing the 95 static objects into 5 separate regions, each 
 consisting of 19 objects (e.g., maybe a character cannot possibly interact 
 with objects in different areas of a great hall concurrently). Now, in 
 those circumstances where the moving objects each appear in only 1 of 
 the 5 static regions (possibly enforced by the application itself), you'll 
 experience from 95 to 105 unique object-object collision tests per collision 
 time-span, depending on whether moving objects appear in different regions 
 or the same one(s). Those circumstances represent an additional performance 
 improvement of roughly 5:1 (based on ~100 vs. 485 unique object-object 
 tests).</p>

<h2>An Example of 50X Performance Via Combined Approaches</h2>

<p>Combining use of collidees vs. colliders with multiple 
 collision groups as indicated in the specific examples above would result 
 in a combined performance improvement of roughly 50:1 (~100 vs. 4950 unique 
 object-object tests).</p>

<p>The point of such examples is to emphasize how important 
 it is to limit the number of impossible collisions from consideration, 
 for the sake of substantial performance gains. Otherwise, the combinatorics 
 can quickly dwarf other collision detection considerations.</p>
