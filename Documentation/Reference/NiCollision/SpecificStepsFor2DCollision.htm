<h1>Specific Steps for 2D Collision</h1>

<p>Here are some specific suggestions for steps
for 2D collision detection:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Set up an "enabling" planar polygon (let's call it a
    "walkabout" polygon) that represents the extent of where the
    character can travel within the scene (ignoring static scene
    elements such as "fixtures", trees, buildings, etc. for the
    moment).

        <p class="indent1">This walkabout polygon can be much
        simpler than the actual terrain or interior geometry
        (e.g., it could be a rectangle made up of 2 triangles, or
        a circle made up of 50 triangles). Tag it with a unique
        label for use by your application, e.g., "walkabout".
        Position it below all the static geometry within your
        scene, and "app cull" it so it is not displayed (except
        maybe for debugging).</p>
    </li>

    <li>Create a portion of the scene graph consisting only of
    this walkabout polygon and all the 2D obstruction polygons
    that represent your fixed scene elements (fixtures, trees,
    buildings, and so on).

        <p class="indent1">This segregation from the rest of
        the scene graph enables more efficient picking
        operations, as well as exempting this static portion of
        the scene graph from expensive calls to Update(). Note
        that the obstruction polygons should be positioned above
        the walkabout polygon. Creation of polygon edges may need
        to factor in whether sliding is possible along that edge
        (e.g., how rounded the edge may need to be).</p>
    </li>

    <li>Arrange picking to occur only with respect to the portion
    of the scene graph which contains the walkabout polygon and
    obstruction polygons, and have the picking sort the polygons
    that it "picks" (i.e., "QUERY_ALL" pick type, "SORT_ON" sort
    type).</li>

    <li>Then at run-time:

        <ol>
            <li>Pick against the walkabout/obstruction polygons
            only.

                <p class="indent2">If the nearest polygon is
                the "walkabout" polygon, then your position is
                "valid".</p>

                <p class="indent2">Otherwise, your position is
                out-of-bounds, since either (i) you're not over
                the walkabout polygon (picking returned no picked
                items), or (ii) you're over an obstruction
                polygon (picking returned an obstruction polygon
                first; after sorting).</p>
            </li>

            <li>Perform the collision response.

                <p class="indent2">One choice for collision
                response (i.e., when the character is
                out-of-bounds) is to keep the character at the
                last known valid position, but change his
                animation to a special idle animation. After
                waiting a minimal amount of time (say, 1/3
                second) to avoid jerkiness in the collision
                response, new inputs from the user (e.g., to
                turn) could enable the character to find a
                direction where movement can continue. This
                approach is simple to implement and seems to work
                well for some applications.</p>

                <p class="indent2">Another choice for collision
                response would involve doing additional picks
                when the character is about to go out-of-bounds
                to find a direction "not far from forward" that
                allows valid motion by the distance specified. In
                this scenario, the character could be turned
                "automatically" in a direction that makes sense.
                Downside to this approach is the need to do
                additional picking, with attendant aliasing
                issues.</p>
