<h1>Collision Proxies</h1>

<p>The main reason for having a high-polygon-count character
or object is to provide enough detail so that the rendering of the object is
visually pleasing and realistic. However, nothing says that the same set of
polygons must be used for collisions involving the object.</p>

<p>An alternative is to build a collision proxy, a
small-polygon-count model that provides a reasonable approximation to the
original object. For example, a 5000-triangle biped could be approximated by a
model consisting of only 100 triangles that would result in a collision test
result that was close to the actual one.</p>

<p>Collision proxies make great sense for irregular objects
that can be enclosed by a very small number of triangles, but which might be
difficult to enclose efficiently with ABVs or a hierarchy of ABVs.</p>
