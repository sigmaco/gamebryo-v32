<h1>Oriented Bounding Boxes</h1>

<p>Given a leaf node with geometry (represented as a list 
 of triangles), an oriented bounding box tree is built by analyzing the 
 distribution of vertices at each leaf node.</p>

<p>To cover the OBB algorithm in greater technical detail, 
 it is necessary to present it in mathematical terms. Note: What follows 
 is a fairly technical discussion.</p>

<p>At the top level, the vertices are fit with a 3D non-circular 
 Gaussian distribution. The mean of the distribution is used as the center 
 of the box. The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix are used for the 
 box axes. The axis lengths are determined by processing the list of vertices 
 and increasing each axis length as necessary so that the final oriented 
 box contains all the vertices.</p>

<p>The vertices for the entire leaf node are then partitioned 
 into two sets based on the information obtained about the OBB. Each subset 
 is fit with a Gaussian distribution and the corresponding OBBs are built. 
 The algorithm continues recursively until the OBB tree has leaf nodes, 
 each representing a triangle of the original scene graph leaf node. Comparison 
 of two OBB trees is similar to that of <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiBound.htm">NiBound</a></span> objects, but heuristically the 
 number of comparisons is reduced because of the tighter fit on the geometry. 
 Moreover, the game engine enables the application to tune OBB collision 
 detection by specifying how many triangles should be stored in the OBB 
 tree leaf nodes. One triangle per node gives higher accuracy of intersection 
 tests, but requires more comparisons between OBBs. More triangles per 
 node reduce the accuracy of the intersection tests, but generally the 
 tree comparisons take less time. The engine also allows the application 
 to specify how many levels into the OBB tree the tests should occur.</p>

<p>The static OBB comparisons are fast in that two boxes 
 are tested for intersection by projection onto various separating axes. 
 It can be shown that at most 15 axes are required to determine static 
 intersections and at most 21 axes are required to determine dynamic intersections, 
 but on average, very few are needed to determine non-intersection. Surprisingly, 
 dynamic OBB comparisons require little additional work. The box projections 
 on a separating axis are intervals. In the static case, two intervals 
 are tested for overlap. If there is no overlap on a single separating 
 axis, then the OBBs do not intersect. If there is overlap on all 15 separating 
 axes, then the OBBs do intersect. In the dynamic case, we simply compute 
 the intersections of the OBBs for both starting time and final time of 
 the frame, and determine if, during that time interval, the projected 
 intervals overlap or not. The velocities of the OBBs are used directly, 
 in determining such overlap.</p>
