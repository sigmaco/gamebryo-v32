<h1>Bounding Spheres</h1>

<p>The bounding spheres for nodes in a Gamebryo scene graph 
 are held in the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiBound.htm">NiBound</a></span> 
 class and can be used for a variety of purposes. One use is for detecting 
 collisions between objects in a scene. The hierarchical nature of a scene 
 graph is used in computing object intersections.</p>

<p>A simple hierarchical approach to determining intersections 
 of two objects, each represented by a subtree of the scene graph, is as 
 follows.&nbsp; If the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiBound.htm">NiBound</a> 
 </span>objects of the root nodes of the subtrees are disjoint then the 
 objects themselves do not intersect.&nbsp; If the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiBound.htm">NiBound</a></span> 
 objects do intersect, the objects may or may not intersect.&nbsp; In this 
 case, the subtrees are descended recursively and the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiBound.htm">NiBound</a></span> 
 objects of the children are compared for overlap.&nbsp; If at some point 
 in the traversal the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiBound.htm">NiBound</a></span> 
 tests show two spheres are disjoint, then the objects contained in those 
 spheres do not intersect.&nbsp; Otherwise, each subtree has a leaf node 
 with geometry for which the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiBound.htm">NiBound</a></span> 
 objects overlap.&nbsp; While the actual polygons represented by those 
 leaf nodes still might not intersect, the application may assume that 
 an intersection has occurred.</p>

<p>In the figure above, a test of the Red and Blue <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiBound.htm">NiBound</a> 
 </span>objects indicates a potential collision. Recursing through Blue's 
 2<sup>nd</sup> level <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiBound.htm">NiBound</a></span> objects reveals a potential collision between 
 one of them and Red's main <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiBound.htm">NiBound</a></span>.&nbsp; 
 Testing Red's 2<sup>nd</sup> level <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiBound.htm">NiBound</a></span> objects against this last blue <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiBound.htm">NiBound</a></span> 
 shows that none of them intersect with it.&nbsp; We don't need to do further 
 polygon intersection tests at this point, as we know there is no way they 
 can intersect.</p>

<p>This algorithm is simple but has a couple of drawbacks.&nbsp; 
 First, the geometry at a leaf node may be complex and the bounding sphere 
 may not accurately represent the shape of the represented object.&nbsp; 
 The application might have a need for a more accurate intersection test.&nbsp; 
 Second, the intersection tests are static; that is, the objects are assumed 
 to have zero velocity.&nbsp; This assumption is inadequate for a 3D game.</p>

<p>For example, the object in the figure below could pass 
 through the wall without any collision being detected by a static overlap 
 test.&nbsp; The application could increase the sampling rate to lower 
 the chance of this situation happening, but the computational cost would 
 be prohibitive, and it is still not guaranteed to work.</p>

</div>

<p>The Gamebryo collision detection system avoids both 
 drawbacks.&nbsp; Collision detection occurs in two phases.&nbsp; As mentioned 
 earlier, the system enables the application to place objects in <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiCollisionGroup.htm">NiCollisionGroup</a> </span>containers. Each group 
 is a collection of objects for which the occurrence of an intersection 
 between any two members is relevant to the application.&nbsp; The first 
 phase is to apply the hierarchical bounding sphere intersection tests 
 to pairs of objects.&nbsp; If this phase shows that two or more objects 
 might intersect, then the second phase performs additional dynamic collision 
 detection tests, with velocities, using alternate bounding volumes (ABVs), 
 oriented bounding boxes (OBBs), or triangles.&nbsp;</p>
