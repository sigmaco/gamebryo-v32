<h1>Second, Consider ABVs for 3D Collision Detection</h1>

<p>Consider an ABV approach if you need 3D collision
detection.</p>

<p>Collision detection can be an expensive operation in a
 real-time 3D application.  In particular, triangle-triangle collision
 detection is very expensive, given the number of triangles in modern
 datasets.  Often you won't need that level of detail on the collision,
 especially since its cost is high.</p>
 
<p>In cases where a character is involved, an optimal 3D
 collision solution (although a 2D approach may be faster) may be to work
 directly with Alternate Bounding Volume (ABV) collisions, without propagating
 the collision detection to triangles lower in the hierarchy (i.e., below the
 ABVs).</p>
 
<p>You can increase performance significantly by carefully
designing your application to take advantage of specific domain knowledge,
using the ABV system with the various propagation flags.  In most cases, the
preferred approach will be a combination of extensive use of ABVs, coupled
with frequent use of the PROPAGATE_NEVER propagation flag.</p>

<p>Where greater accuracy is desired, simpler geometry in the
form of a proxy may be created to provide the level of detail needed for
collision detection.  For example, it is conceivable that a 5000-triangle
object may be modeled effectively as a 100-triangle proxy, where the proxy
effectively approximates the appropriate collision detection behavior.</p>

<p>By providing a variety of ABV types, propagation flags, and
collision proxies, Gamebryo offers a great deal of flexibility, so application
developers can find the right combinations for optimal performance and
effective collision response.</p>
 
<p>You may use the ABV construction facilities of the Gamebryo
exporter plug-ins to create ABVs that may be streamed to the same Nif file
that contains your model scene graph.  This approach involves tagging the
geometry with special names that the CreateABV plug-in will use in deciding
what ABVs to create.</p>
