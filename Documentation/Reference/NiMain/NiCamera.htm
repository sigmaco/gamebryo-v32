<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span> objects represent
cameras in the scene graph. They have no inherent geometric
representation, but use their parents' transforms to determine
their location and orientation in world space. This organization
enables cameras in Gamebryo to be attached to scene graph objects
and automatically follow them for "in-car" cameras and
"missile-cams". See the <a href=
"../../Programmer/General_Topics/Cameras.htm">camera
documentation</a> for details on the camera model in
Gamebryo.</p>

vectors represent the coordinate system in which the view
coordinates (and the view itself) are defined. They correspond to
the model-space origin, model-space X-axis, model-space Y-axis,

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void SetViewFrustum(const
<a href="NiFrustum.htm">NiFrustum</a>&amp; kFrustum)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Retrieve and set the view
frustum parameters. The values for the near and far view frustum
planes are checked to conform to the minimum near plane distance
and maximum far-to-near-plane-distance ratio defined for the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span> class. The near plane
is adjusted if the settings do not conform. The mechanism for the
check is as follows: if the near plane value is less than the new
far plane divided by the maximum far-to-near ratio (set with
functions below), then the near plane is set to be the new far
plane divided by the maximum ratio. If this value for the near
plane is less than the minimum near plane distance value, it is
increased to the minimum value. The control values for this check
can be set using the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetMinNearPlaneDist</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetMaxFarNearRatio</span> functions described
later.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">bool FitNearAndFarToBound(const
<a href="NiBound.htm">NiBound</a>&amp; kBound)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Fits the near and far planes
of the current camera (the camera is assumed to have been updated
prior to the call) to be tangent to a given world-space bound. If
the sphere is entirely behind the camera, then the planes will
not be changed and the function will return <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">false.</span> If the computed near plane value is
less than the new far plane divided by the maximum far-to-near
ratio (set with functions below), then the near plane is set to
be the new far plane divided by the maximum ratio.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This approach avoids creating
a near and far plane ratio that is too large for Z-buffer and
projection accuracy. The function returns <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">true</span> on success, and the planes will have
been updated (<span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> need not
be called upon the camera after a call to this function).</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">NOTE: this function is
designed for use with viewer, editor, and CAD-like applications,
where a single object is to be viewed in it entirety. It should
not be used to set the near and far distances in interior games
and large exterior databases. In the former case, the application
should use knowledge of the database to limit the far distance to
whatever could be seen from the current room. In the latter case,
fogging or line-of-sight should be used to limit the far plane
distance.</p>

fTargetAspectRatio, bool bAdjustVerticalDims = false)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Adjust the camera to the
target aspect ratio. By default, the horizontal dimensions of the

will fix the horizontal and adjust the vertical dimensions of the
frustum.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void SetViewPort(const <a href=
"NiRect.htm">NiRect</a>&lt;float&gt;&amp; kPort)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Retrieve and set the port on
the backbuffer to which the view frustum is mapped. The left edge
of the backbuffer is <span class="NDLSystemFont">0.0</span>; the
right edge is <span class="NDLSystemFont">1.0</span>. The top
edge of the backbuffer is <span class="NDLSystemFont">1.0</span>;

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This function changes the
local rotation matrix of the given camera so that the camera is
looking at the given world-space point, with an up vector that is
as close as possible to the given world-space up vector. This
function will work even if the camera is not the root of a scene
graph (i.e. it has parent transforms), but the camera must be
up-to-date (i.e. Update must have been called on the camera or an
ancestor since the last transform change). The function returns
false if it cannot satisfy the given request, which, for example,
might occur when the given world-space location is equal to the
camera location, or true on success.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">bool WorldPtToScreenPt(const
<a href="NiPoint3.htm">NiPoint3</a>&amp; kPt, float&amp; fBx,
float&amp; fBy, float fZeroTolerance = 1e-5f) const</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Projects the given point to
the screen. Returns <span class="NDLSystemFont">true</span> if
the point can be projected and the projection is within the
camera's view, or <span class="NDLSystemFont">false</span>
otherwise. The returned point is normalized to the backbuffer
size, not port size. However, the port is taken into account
during the calculation. The left edge of the backbuffer is
<span class="NDLSystemFont">0.0</span>; the right edge is
<span class="NDLSystemFont">1.0.</span> The top edge of the
backbuffer is <span class="NDLSystemFont">1.0</span>; the bottom
edge is <span class="NDLSystemFont">0.0</span>. Note that this
coordinate system is flipped vertically relative to the
coordinate system used by <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span>.
The final argument (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">fZeroTolerance</span>) allows the caller to
specify the desired near plane distance, behind which the
function will return <span class="NDLSystemFont">false</span>.
<span class="NDLSystemFont">fZeroTolerance</span> must be greater
than or equal to zero. The function clamps this value to that
range internally for safety.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Regardless of the return value
of the function, the values in fBx and fBy will be valid for any
point that passes the near plane distance test. A failure of the
near plane test will return false and have the value FLT_MAX in
fBx and fBy. Additionally, note that even though the returned
coordinates are normalized to the backbuffer, the view port is
taken into account. Thus, a point that projects to the lower left
corner of the camera frustum in normalized device coordinates
will map to the lower left corner of the view port in backbuffer
coordinate space. For example, if the view port is <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">{0.25, 0.75, 0.75, 0.25}</span> a point projected
to the lower left corner would return <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">0.25</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">0.25</span> rather than <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">0.0</span> and <span class=

const</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Same as above, but also
includes the Z value. The Z value is projected non-linearly such
that values on the near plane of the camera frustum return a Z of
<span class="NDLSystemFont">0.0</span> and values on the far
plane of the camera frustum return Z of <span class=

is used. The ray that is returned represents the ray whose
projection is the center of the given pixel. This function is
useful for 3D picking. The function returns false if the given
