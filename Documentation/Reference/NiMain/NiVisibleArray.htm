<p class="NDLRefHead1">Description</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> is an
array-based container class that is designed to hold an ordered
collection of references to <font><a href=
"NiRenderObject.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span></a></font> objects. The
container serves as the data communication between culling and
rendering or accumulating. Culling operations (either manual or
automated via <a href="NiCullingProcess.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span></a>) populate these
containers, and rendering entities such as <a href=
"NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulators</span></a> and some of the
<a href="NiDrawSceneUtility.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawSceneUtility</span></a> functions consume
them. They are always packed arrays, since references cannot
represent "NULL". This is enforced by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Add</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Set</span> functions, which take references, not
pointers, making it impossible to place a NULL object into the
array.</p>

<p>The container grows automatically during insertion, based on a
growth rate that can be adjusted. The class is intentionally
built to be lightweight, avoiding the addition of rarely-used
"helper" functions that can be written using the existing
interfaces.</p>

<p>Objects referred to by this array do not have their reference
counts incremented. For reasons of performance, the class
assumes that the objects are referred to by other
reference-counted system for the duration of their lifetime in
the container. Applications are responsible for ensuring that
objects added to these containers are removed from the container
before the objects are destroyed.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Constructors</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">NiVisibleArray()</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This constructor creates an
object with initial allocated size and grow by increment set to
the class defaults, which may be found in the header as
<span class="NDLSystemFont">DEF_MAX_SIZE</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">DEF_GROW_BY</span>, respectively. The count is
initially 0, as the container is empty (but the array storage is
pre-allocated according to the default size).</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">NiVisibleArray(unsigned int
uiMaxSize, unsigned int uiGrowBy)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This constructor creates an
object with initial allocated size and grow by increment set to
the given function parameters. The count is initially 0, as the
container is empty (but the array storage is pre-allocated
according to the given initial size).</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Supported Member Functions</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void Add(NiRenderObject&amp;
kObj)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Adds the given renderable
object to the end of the array, growing the array if the
allocated storage is already filled. The array will grow (if
needed) by the class's grow by increment. A larger increment
will result in fewer allocations/deallocations, but can waste
more memory if the allocated storage is never used. Note that
reallocation is transparent to the user, as the active objects in
the reallocated array will not change. The reference count of
the given object is not changed by this operation.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void RemoveAll()</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Resets the array to have an
object count of 0 (i.e. the next call to Add will add the object
to the head of the array). This is an extremely fast operation. 
It does not delete any of the array storage, and does not change
the reference count of any object in the container.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void SetAt(unsigned int uiIndex,
NiRenderObject&amp; kObj)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Replaces the element at the
given index with the given renderable object. This function
cannot add past the end of the container. It can only replace an
active element with a new value. As a result, it is the
application's responsibility to ensure that <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">uiIndex &lt; GetCount()</span>. In debugging
builds, failure to do so will result in an assertion failure. 
This policy is in place to ensure that the array remains
packed. </p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">NiRenderObject&amp;
RemoveAtAndFill(unsigned int uiIndex)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This function represents a
fast way to delete an element from the container while keeping
the packed array invariant. The item at the given index is
replaced by the last element in the array, and the count of
active objects is decremented by one. It is the application's
responsibility to ensure that <span class="NDLSystemFont">uiIndex
&lt; GetCount()</span>, which also implies that the container is
not already empty. In debugging builds, failure to do so will
result in an assertion failure. This function does not preserve
the order of elements, since the last item on the array is moved
to <span class="NDLSystemFont">uiIndex</span>. In conjunction
with <span class="NDLSystemFont">Add</span>, this function can be
used to implement a stack, with Pop being implemented as:</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">kObj = RemoveAtAndFill(GetCount() - 1)</span></p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">NiRenderObject&amp;
GetAt(unsigned int uiIndex)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">NiRenderObject&amp;
GetAt(unsigned int uiIndex) const</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Returns the object at the
given index. It is the application's responsibility to ensure
that <span class="NDLSystemFont">uiIndex &lt; GetCount()</span>. 
In debugging builds, failure to do so will result in an assertion
failure.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">unsigned int GetCount() const</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Returns the number of items
currently in the container.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">inline unsigned int
GetAllocatedSize() const</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Returns the current size of
the internal array storage (in elements).</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void SetAllocatedSize(unsigned
int uiSize)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Reallocates the internal array
storage to the given size (in elements). If the new size is
smaller than the current object count, then the object count will
be set to the new allocated size. Setting this value to 0 will
delete the internal array. This function is called automatically
by <span class="NDLSystemFont">Add</span> as needed to grow the
array.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">unsigned int GetGrowBy()
const</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Returns the quantum (in
elements) that the Add function will grow the array by each time
it runs out of existing storage.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void SetGrowBy(unsigned int
uiGrowBy)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Sets the quantum (in
elements) that the Add function will grow the array by each time
it runs out of existing storage. If 0 is passed in to this
function, the grow by quantum will be set to 1 for safety.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Notes</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Insertion and Deletion Policy</p>

<p>The array is designed to be packed as an invariant, meaning
that there is no need to check each active element against NULL
for safety. The interfaces reflect this, accepting and returning
only references to the renderable objects, not pointers. 
Internally, the objects are stored in the array as pointers, but
the interfaces ensure that these are non-NULL pointers. In
addition, new elements can only be added or removed from the end
of the array, so that there is no "blank" space in the array.</p>

<p>This invariant allows for a lightweight class that supports
its primary purpose (culling and rendering) well - a class that
allows fast addition of new items to the end of the array, allows
for extremely fast clearing of the array, and allows for fast,
random read/write access to the elements of the array.</p>
