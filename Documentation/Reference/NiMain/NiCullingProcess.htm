<p class="NDLRefHead1">Description</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> forms the
core interface of the hierarchical scene culling system. A
culling process object serves to convert a camera and a scene
graph into a flat container (<a href=
"NiVisibleArray.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span></a>) of visible geometry. 
This object is passed through the hierarchical culling traversal,
and serves not only to implement the culling behavior, but also
to serve as a holding point for data that must be carried
throughout the entire culling pass. <a href=
"NiAVObject.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span></a> and its subclasses actually
implement the culling traversal, but <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> implements the culling
behavior at each node traversed (including the ability to skip
the traversal of a node and thus any subtree below it).</p>

<p>The abstract base class implements frustum culling; subclasses
can implement additional or replacement culling behaviors. The
discussion below includes information that is of use to those who
would create a subclass of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>. Note, however, that you
can not directly subclass <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> since all constructors
are private. Users must instead subclass from the friend class,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshCullingProcess,</span> to
insure proper execution of mesh modifiers.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Constructors</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">NiCullingProcess(<a href=
"NiVisibleArray.htm">NiVisibleArray</a>* pkVisibleSet, <a href=
"../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm">NiSPWorkflowManager</a>*
pkWorkflowManager)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This constructor sets the
internally-held visible array pointer to the passed-in visible
array. Note that the culling process does not take ownership of
this visible array, and will not delete it upon deletion of the
culling process. NULL is a valid value for the pointer to the
visible array, but if no visible array is passed in to the
constructor, then one must be attached with <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetVisibleSet</span> prior to calling
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Process</span>, or else the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Process</span> call must include a
pointer to a valid visible array. It will also set the internal
camera pointer to NULL and the frustum to a default (zero)
frustum. These latter members are set automatically within the
top-level <span class="NDLSystemFont">Process</span> call. The
workflow manager pointer is simply set to internal storage so the
base class can return it without virtual function overhead.
Subclasses should manage the lifetime of that object.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">NiCullingProcess(<a href=

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This protected constructor is
only used when declaring subclasses of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> via <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMeshCullingProcess</span>. This constructor
allows subclasses to set the value of the const member variable
<span class="NDLSystemFont">m_bUseVirtualAppend</span> to true. 
All other members are set in the same manner as the above
constructor. See the "Subclassing <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>" notes section below for
details.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Supported Member Functions</p>

<p>Note that unlike some other Gamebryo class references, some of
the member functions listed below are protected. They are listed
to provide insight to the user on what methods to override when
creating subclasses of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>. Protected members will
be referenced as such in the documentation to avoid
confusion.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Culling Functions</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void Cull(const <a href=
"NiCamera.htm">NiCamera</a>* pkCamera, <a href=
"NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a>* pkScene, <a href=
"NiVisibleArray.htm">NiVisibleArray</a>* pkVisibleSet)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This is the top-level public
entry point for culling. <span class="NDLSystemFont">Cull</span>
will call into <span class="NDLSystemFont">Process</span> with
the same arguments that are passed to it. Cull exists as a
non-virtual entry point allowing Gamebryo to enforce proper
execution of mesh modifiers in subclasses of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">The camera and scene are
required parameters; they must point to a valid camera and scene,
which will be used as the source information for
culling&mdash;the given scene will be culled according to the
view represented by the given camera. The visible array argument
is normally optional. If it is non-NULL, then the given visible
array will replace the culling process's existing internally-held
culling process <em>for the duration of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Process</span> call</em>. At the end of the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Process</span> call, the previous
visible array will be reinstated. Note that if the culling
process has no internally-held visible array at the time of the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Process</span> call, then a valid one
<em>must</em> be provided in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Process</span> parameters. The basic idea of the
visible array argument is to allow the caller to pass in an
optional destination to the function.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">virtual void Process(const
<a href="NiCamera.htm">NiCamera</a>* pkCamera, <a href=
"NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a>* pkScene, <a href=
"NiVisibleArray.htm">NiVisibleArray</a>* pkVisibleSet) = 0</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Note that <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Process</span> is pure virtual. A default
implementation is provided, however, which subclasses can access
by calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess::Process</span>. That
implementation is described below.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">The function sets the frustum
and local camera to the passed-in camera object, and then culls
the given scene into the active visible array (either the
parameter to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Process</span> call,
or the existing visible array, as discussed above). Note that
the visible array is not reset during this call - all geometry
will be appended onto the end of any existing geometry already
culled into the array. Thus, multiple calls to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Process</span> will simply append the all of the
visible geometry into a single visible array.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">virtual void Process(<a href=
"NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a>* pkObject)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This protected function is
used internally by each traversed <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span> (which is a friend of
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>) to cull
itself, including internal nodes. The base class version
computes frustum culling of the object against the frustum,
calling <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a>::OnVisible</span> if the object
is found to be within the frustum. This function is virtual and
can be overridden by a subclass to change the culling behavior of
the system. For example, a version of this function that simply
called <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnVisible</span> upon each
object passed in would equate to a "pass through" culler,
accepting the entire scene as visible.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Visible Set Functions</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void SetVisibleSet(<a href=
"NiVisibleArray.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span></a>* pkVisibleSet)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Replaces the existing <a href=
"NiVisibleArray.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span></a> with the given object. 
Note that the culling process does not take ownership of either
the existing or new this visible array, and will not delete it
upon deletion of the culling process or upon replacement by
another via a call to this function.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction"><a href=
"NiVisibleArray.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span></a>* GetVisibleSet()</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Returns a pointer to the
current visible array associated with the culling process, or
NULL if no array is associated with it.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">const <a href=
"NiCamera.htm">NiCamera</a>* GetCamera() const</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">If the culling process object
is currently in the process of culling (i.e. is inside of a
recursive <span class="NDLSystemFont">Process</span> call), this
function returns a valid pointer to the camera being used to
cull. If the culling process is not currently culling a scene,
this function will return NULL.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm">NiSPWorkflowManager</a>*
GetWorkflowManager()</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Returns the internally stored
pointer to the workflow manager. This manager is set by
subclasses and used by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> library to execute mesh modifiers
efficiently.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">bool GetSubmitModifiers()
const</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void SetSubmitModifiers(bool
bSubmitModifiers)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Specifies whether mesh
modifiers should be submitted during culling. This value defaults
to true. If the culled objects are to be rendered, this value
should be true to ensure that mesh modifiers are submitted
properly. Setting this flag to false will allow a culling pass to
be performed without submitting mesh modifiers and hence without
requiring their modifiers to be subsequently completed. If
multiple culling passes are desired in a given frame without
rendering or manual completion of mesh modifiers between the
passes, this value should be set to true for the last pass and
false for all the previous passes in that frame. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CompleteTasks</span> will still be called on mesh
modifiers with the appropriate point during culling regardless of
this flag.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Frustum Access Functions</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">const <a href=
"NiFrustum.htm">NiFrustum</a>&amp; GetFrustum() const</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Returns the currently-active
frustum being used to cull geometry. This function is designed
to be used during a <span class="NDLSystemFont">Process</span>
pass (i.e. when the culling process is actually culling
geometry).</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void SetFrustum(const <a href=
"NiFrustum.htm">NiFrustum</a>&amp; kFrustum)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Sets the frustum - this
function can only be called when there is a valid camera
associated with the culling process object, which is during a
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Process</span> pass (i.e. when the
culling process is actually culling geometry). This function not
only sets the frustum itself, but also updates the <a href=
"NiFrustumPlanes.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiFrustumPlanes</span></a> object according to
the camera and frustum values.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">const <a href=
"NiFrustumPlanes.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiFrustumPlanes</span></a>&amp;
GetFrustumPlanes() const</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Returns the set of frustum
planes and the active plane state for the culling process. This
state is only valid while the culling process is in a recursive
sequence of <span class="NDLSystemFont">Process</span> calls
(i.e. the culling process is currently culling a scene). Since
the planes are based upon the culling process's frustum,
read-only access is provided - a call to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess::SetFrustum</span> is required
to change the planes themselves. </p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Internal Geometry Addition Functions</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void Append(<a href=
"NiRenderObject.htm">NiRenderObject</a>&amp; kVisible)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This function is called by
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiRenderObject.htm">NiRenderObject</a></span>::AppendToCullingProcess
to declare itself as a visible object. This function does one of
two things, depending on the value of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">const bool</span> member variable <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">m_bUseVirtualAppend</span>. If <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">m_bUseVirtualAppend</span> is <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">false</span> (which it is for concrete
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> objects),
then this inline function simply adds the geometry to the culling
process's visible array. However, if <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">m_bUseVirtualAppend</span> is true (as it could
be in a subclass), then the function calls the subclass's
override of <span class="NDLSystemFont">VirtualAppend</span> . 
This system avoids a virtual function call in most cases (at the
expense of a single conditional), while allowing subclasses the
ability to override the base class behavior if desired.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">virtual void
AppendVirtual(<a href=
"NiRenderObject.htm">NiRenderObject</a>&amp; kVisible)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This protected virtual is
called by <span class="NDLSystemFont">Append</span> to register
visible geometry objects if the class instance was constructed
with <span class="NDLSystemFont">m_bUseVirtualAppend</span> equal
to <span class="NDLSystemFont">true</span>. Thus, a subclass may
override the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Append</span> behavior
by overriding <span class="NDLSystemFont">AppendVirtual</span>
and setting <span class="NDLSystemFont">bUseVirtual</span> to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">true</span> in the base class
constructor. This second step is required - simply overriding
<span class="NDLSystemFont">AppendVirtual</span> will not
suffice, as the system avoids the virtual call altogether when
<span class="NDLSystemFont">m_bUseVirtualAppend</span> is
<span class="NDLSystemFont">false</span> .</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Notes</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Subclassing <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span></p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> includes
three virtual functions that are designed to allow subclassing to
add behavior to the base class. Note, however, that subclasses
must derive from <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMeshCullingProcess</span> to insure proper
execution of mesh modifiers. One of these virtual functions is
called once per overall culling pass over a scene graph:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Process(const NiCamera*,
NiAVObject*, NiVisibleArray*)</span>. It is overridden to
control the top-level culling of a scene. It sets up the culling
process (including view data, a visible array, etc) for a culling
pass, initiates the culling pass via a call to the scene graph
root's <span class="NDLSystemFont">Cull</span> function, and then
does any required post-processing after the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Cull</span> function returns.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Process(NiAVObject*)</span> is
called for each potentially visible object in the scene,
including internal nodes. A subclass may override this function
to change how culling is computed at each and every scene node. 
If the given object is determined to be visible, then this
function should call <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject::OnVisible</a></span> upon it.</p>

<p>The final function, as described above is <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AppendVirtual</span>. A subclass that needs to
handle visible geometry in a manner more complex than simply
adding it to the visible array can do so by overriding
<span class="NDLSystemFont">AppendVirtual</span> and passing
<span class="NDLSystemFont">true</span> to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">bUseVirtualAppend</span> argument of the base
class. If this <span class="NDLSystemFont">const bool</span> is
true for a given instance, then the base class non-virtual
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Append</span> will call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AppendVirtual</span> to allow it to do whatever
it needs to the visible geometry.</p>
