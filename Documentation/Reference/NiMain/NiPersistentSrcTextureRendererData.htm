<p class="NDLRefHead1">Description</p>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span> objects are the two main
forms of texture data representation in Gamebryo. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiSourceTexture.htm">NiSourceTexture</a></span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiSourceCubeMap.htm">NiSourceCubeMap</a></span> texture objects
may be created from either <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</span> or
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span> objects.</p>

<p>The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</span> class
is designed specifically for streaming persistent versions of
source texture renderer data to support platform-specific texture
format conversions for "internal textures" (those included in a
scene's NIF file) at export time.</p>

<p>This capability enables platform-specific source texture
renderer data to be loaded directly into the appropriate platform
at application load time, with two very beneficial results:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Improvements in "high water mark" behavior for texture
    memory at load time. In other words, temporary memory
    allocations for texture format conversion will not be
    required if a platform-specific export option is requested in
    the art pipeline.</li>

    <li>Load time performance improvements, since there are no
    texture format conversions at load time.</li>
</ul>

<p>A caveat to this approach is that the texture is configured
specifically for a target platform (or graphics card), and may
not be loadable for use with alternative platforms or graphics
cards, or with tools on the PC. If a texture is configured
specifically for one target platform or graphics card, but an
attempt is made to load it on a platform or graphics card that
can't support it, <a href=
"../../Programmer/Texturing/Failures.htm">"error" replacement
textures</a> are used to indicate load-time errors.</p>

<p>To specify <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</span>-based
textures for export from the art packages, you may select any of
the non-generic platform types with internal textures (include
textures in the main NIF). Specifically, these choices
include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Xbox360, with internal textures</li>

    <li>Playstation3, with internal textures</li>

    <li>DX9, with internal textures</li>

    <li>D3D10, with internal textures</li>

    <li>D3D11, with internal textures</li>
</ul>

<p>[Note that each time a platform SDK (e.g., Xbox360 XDK or
Playstation3 SDK) changes, there is at least a possibility that
the new SDK will cause textures to be formatted differently on
that platform. It is not likely to happen frequently, but the
possibility exists. In such a case, it may be desirable to
re-export Nifs containing platform-specific textures using
exporters built with that platform's most recent SDK
version.]</p>

<p>If application requirements dictate fully general support of
textures within a NIF file on multiple platforms or graphics
cards, then <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span>-based textures may be
used, since they enable on the fly texture format conversions at
load time. To specify <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span>-based textures for
export from the art packages, you may select one of four export
options: (1) "generic" platform type, but include textures in
main NIF, (2) save textures as separate NIFs, (3) textures as
original images, or (4) textures as original images VRAM.</p>

<p>Consult the export options for <a href=
"../../Art/Max/Gamebryo_3ds_max_Export_Options1.htm">3ds max</a>
or <a href="../../Art/Maya/Export_Display_Options.htm">Maya</a>
for more details.</p>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</span> objects
represent one or more two-dimensional arrays of pixel values or
"faces", as well as pyramids of multiple mipmap levels, each of
two-dimensional arrays of pixel values. The object also contains
information representing the format of the pixels in the data
arrays, as well as the dimensions of the arrays. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</span> objects
can represent full mipmap pyramids and a wide range of pixel
formats. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</span> objects
may also refer to <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiPalette.htm">NiPalette</a></span> objects, and can even share
them. All "faces" of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</span> are
laid out so that each face's full mip-map pyramid is contiguous
in memory.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Constructors</p>

<p>There are no public constructors for <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</span>
objects. All instances should be created via the static member
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Create()</span> function or via the
streaming system creation functions.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Static Member Functions</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">static
NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData* Create(NiSourceTexture*
pkTexture, const <a href = "../../Reference/efd/efd__SystemDesc.htm">efd::SystemDesc::RendererID</a> eTargetRenderer)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Creates an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</span> object
that represents, for the supplied source texture for the
specified renderer, a persistent (streamable) version of
renderer-specific source texture renderer data. Appropriate
texture format decisions and texture format conversions are
handled during <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</span>
creation, with the expectation that this object will ultimately
be streamed out to a NIF file, to optimize load time performance
and load time memory efficiencies for specific platforms.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">When the texture data is
loaded into the renderer at application load time, the renderer
will load the persistent source texture renderer data directly
into a renderer-specific resource, bypassing the
application-level <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span> object and all
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiImageConverter.htm">NiImageConverter</a></span>-based texture
conversion at load time entirely. By default, the image is
assumed to be static.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">static void
SetToolModeStreaming(bool bToolModeStreaming);</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">static bool
GetToolModeStreaming();</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">The intent of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</span> class
and its renderer-specific subclasses (for example, 
<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDX9PersistentSrcTextureRendererData</span>) is
to perform as much texture conversion, tiling, and set-up work as
feasible at export time, enabling fast and memory-efficient
loading of platform-specific textures at load time.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">If you also wish to stream out
the platform-specific texture data that was streamed into your
application, the data streamed out will likely match the data
streamed in. However, there is no absolute guarantee that the
data loaded into a platform-specific resource by the platform SDK
won't be altered by the platform SDK or drivers.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Thus, a "tools mode" option
exists, in which pristine copies of platform-specific texture
data are saved in memory to guarantee that what will be streamed
out matches what has been streamed in. Applications that need to
stream out platform-specific textures that are guaranteed to
match exactly the platform-specific textures that were streamed
in may need to call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData::SetToolModeStreaming(true)</span>
during application initialization. Such applications tend to be
tools, as opposed to run-time applications.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">However, if your application
does not need to stream out the platform-specific texture data,
it is obviously superior to leave tool mode streaming off (the
default setting), to avoid what then would constitute unnecessary
memory allocations.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Notes</p>

<a name="Mipmap_Level_Pixel_Storage" id="Mipmap_Level_Pixel_Storage"></a><p class="NDLRefHead2">Mipmap Level Pixel Storage</p>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</span> objects
store the pixel values for each mipmap level consecutively,
packed one right after another. Each mipmap level is not
individually aligned. As a result, the data may be copied using a
single <span class="NDLSystemFont">memcpy</span> operation by
retrieving the base address of mipmap level 0 and copying the
number of bytes returned by <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData::GetTotalSizeInBytes</span>.</p>

<a name="Mipmap_Pyramid_Generation" id="Mipmap_Pyramid_Generation"></a><p class="NDLRefHead2">Mipmap Pyramid Generation</p>

<p>Gamebryo supports partial mipmap pyramids. For example, while
the full pyramid for a 16x16 image would be the following set of
mipmap levels: 16x16, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2, 1x1, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</span> may
also be used to store the following partial mipmap pyramid: 
16x16, 8x8. However, intermediate mipmap levels cannot be skipped
each mipmap level must be half the dimension of the one above it
in the chain.</p>

<p>Note that Gamebryo considers a full pyramid with a non-square
image to be the one whose coarsest mipmap level is 1x1; e.g.,
16x4, 8x2, 4x1, 2x1, 1x1.</p>

<p>Also, although mipmaps are not generated automatically for
non-power-of-two dimensions, a mipmap with non-power-of-two
dimensions may be used if it is supplied with the texture. In
such cases, mipmaps for non-power-of-two textures adopt the
convention of "rounding down" as you go from an odd dimension to
the corresponding "halved" dimension for the next smaller mipmap
level; e.g., 14x6, 7x3, 3x1, 1x1.</p>
