<p class="NDLRefHead1">Description</p>

<p>This header includes several functions that encapsulate
geometry culling, sorting and rendering. The functions cover
several levels of complexity, from completely encapsulated sorted
scene rendering to lower-level functions that sort and render
previously culled geometry. For the vast majority of simple
applications, these functions can partially or completely replace
any need for application-level manual rendering code.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Functions</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">unsigned int NiDrawScene(<a href=
"NiCamera.htm">NiCamera</a>* pkCamera, <a href=
"NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a>* pkScene, <a href=
"NiCullingProcess.htm">NiCullingProcess</a>&amp; kCuller,
<a href="NiVisibleArray.htm">NiVisibleArray</a>* pkVisibleSet =
NULL)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This is the most complete
culling and rendering function of this set. It assumes that the
scene is open for rendering and a render target group is open for
rendering. </p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">To prepare for rendering, the
function sets the given camera's view data to the renderer
and clears the given visible set of all previously-culled
objects. Then, it uses the given <a href=
"NiCullingProcess.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span></a> object to cull the
given scene graph into the passed-in <a href=
"NiVisibleArray.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span></a>. It then calls
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDrawVisibleArray</span> (described
below) to render the resulting visible array to the active render
target group. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDrawScene</span>
returns the number of elements in the visible array. </p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">For many applications, this is
all that is needed to render their scene. Note at the end of the
function the visible array will still contain the culled scene
geometry objects, which can then be used for other application
purposes, such as additional rendering. The functionality is
roughly analogous to the (now removed) Gamebryo 1 <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiCamera.htm">NiCamera::Click</a></span>
function.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">unsigned int
NiDrawVisibleArray(<a href="NiCamera.htm">NiCamera</a>* pkCamera,
<a href="NiVisibleArray.htm">NiVisibleArray</a>&amp;
kVisibleSet)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Designed for situations
where the desired geometry has already been culled into an
<a href="NiVisibleArray.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span></a>, this function assumes
that the scene is open for rendering, a render target group is
open for rendering, the camera data has been set to the
renderer. </p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">If there is an accumulator
attached to the renderer, the function does several things with
the accumulator: calls <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">StartAccumulating</span> on it, registers
the given visible array with it, and then calls <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FinishAccumulating</span> on it. If no
accumulator is attached to the renderer, the function simply
renders all of the geometry objects in the given visible array by
calling <span class="NDLSystemFont">RenderImmediate</span> upon
each of them.  In either case, at the conclusion of this function
the visible array will have been drawn to the device, modified by
the accumulator (if active). <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawVisibleArray</span> returns the number of
elements in the visible array.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Note that multiple calls in
sequence to this function will be sorted independent of one
another - all of the items from the first call will be sorted and
rendered, and then all of the items from the second call will be
sorted and rendered. If an application needs to sort several
visible arrays together before rendering, they should use
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDrawVisibleArrayAppend</span>
(below).</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">unsigned int
NiDrawVisibleArrayAppend(<a href=
"NiVisibleArray.htm">NiVisibleArray</a>&amp; kVisibleSet)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">The lowest-level of these
functions, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawVisibleArrayAppend</span> assumes that the
scene is open for rendering, a render target group is open for
rendering, the camera data has been set to the renderer, and the
<a href="NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> attached to the <a href=
"NiRenderer.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderer</span></a> (if any) has already been
opened with <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">StartAccumulating</span>. </p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This function simply renders
or registers the geometry with the accumulator. If there is no
accumulator attached to the renderer, then the function loops
over all geometry in the given <a href=
"NiVisibleArray.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span></a>, calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RenderImmediate</span> upon each object. If
there is an accumulator attached to the renderer, then the
visible array is registered with it via <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator::RegisterObjectArray</span>.
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDrawVisibleArrayAppend</span>
returns the number of elements in the visible array.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Note that since the function
does not call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator::FinishAccumulating</span>, it is
possible that not all geometry passed into this function will
have been rendered at the close of this function. The remaining
geometry will be rendered by the accumulator when <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FinishAccumulating</span> is called later in the
frame. This is actually the desired behavior. For example,
imagine we had an <a href="NiAlphaAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAlphaAccumulator</span></a> attached to the
renderer. If we were to call this function three times with
different geometry, we would want all of the blended objects in
the three visible arrays to be registered with the accumulator
before the alpha sorting was done, to make sure that the blended
objects from the different visible arrays could be sorted with
respect to one another. This function is useful in cases where
multiple visible array objects are to be drawn into the same
rendering target using the same accumulator.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">unsigned int NiCullScene(<a href=
"NiCamera.htm">NiCamera</a>* pkCamera, <a href=
"NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a>* pkScene, <a href=
"NiCullingProcess.htm">NiCullingProcess</a>&amp; kCuller,
<a href="NiVisibleArray.htm">NiVisibleArray</a>&amp;
pkVisibleSet, bool bResetArray = true)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This function is used to cull
items in a scene graph into an array of visible objects. No
rendering will occur in this function. Instead, call one of the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDrawVisibleArray</span> functions
listed above. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullScene</span>
returns the number of visible objects identified in the scene and
added to the visible array.</p>
