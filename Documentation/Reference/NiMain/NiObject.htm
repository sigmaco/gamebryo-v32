<p class="NDLRefHead1">Description</p>

<p>A class (not strictly abstract, but abstract in practice)
supporting cloning, streaming, and other basic services used by
most Gamebryo classes. This class is described at length in the
<a href=
"../../Programmer/Object_Systems/Introduction_to_Object_Systems.htm">
object system documentation</a>. A reference is provided here
along with links to specific sections of the <a href=
"../../Programmer/Object_Systems/Introduction_to_Object_Systems.htm">
object system documentation</a>.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Constructors</p>

<p>There are no public constructors for <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiObject</span>. All instances should be created
via the streaming system creation functions although generally an
application will create subclasses of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiObject</span>.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Supported Member Functions</p>

<p>Note that unlike some other Gamebryo class references, some of
the member functions listed below are protected. They are listed
to provide insight to the user on what methods to override when
creating subclasses of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiObject</span>. Protected members will be
referenced as such in the documentation to avoid
confusion.</p><a name="Cloning" id="Cloning"></a>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Cloning</p>

<p>Gamebryo's cloning system provides capabilities for cloning a
scene graph. For full information on the cloning system, please
refer to the <a href=
"../../Programmer/Object_Systems/Cloning_Internals.htm">cloning
internals documentation.</a></p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">NiObject* Clone()</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This function should be called
to create a clone of an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiObject</span> based object. It will call the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateClone</span> method and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CopyMembers</span> methods listed
below to insure that proper data is shared versus duplicated.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">NiObject* Clone(<a href=
"NiCloningProcess.htm">NiCloningProcess</a>&amp; kCloning)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This function operates exactly
as <span class="NDLSystemFont">Clone()</span> except that users
can modify the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiCloningProcess.htm">NiCloningProcess</a></span> object before
it is passes in insuring accurate copying of names in
multithreaded applications.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">NiObjectPtr CreateDeepCopy()</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Create a full deep copy of the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObject</span>. No data will be
shared.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">virtual NiObject* CreateClone
(<a href="NiCloningProcess.htm">NiCloningProcess</a>&amp;
kCloning)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This public member is called
by the cloning system to create a new object. It is typically a
small function that calls the null constructor of the derived
class and <span class="NDLSystemFont">CopyMembers</span>.
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateClone</span> is usually
declared via the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDeclareClone</span> macro.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">NiObject* CreateSharedClone
(<a href="NiCloningProcess.htm">NiCloningProcess</a>&amp;
kCloning)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This public member is called
by the cloning system to create a clone of an object which may be
potentially shared amongst objects. The shared object still needs
to be cloned so that it is not shared with the original object,
but only needs to be cloned once so that all the new clones can
share that clone. This member function is a convenience function
to check if an object has already been cloned. If so, then it
just returns that clone and will not create another. If it does
not exist, then this function will do the same thing as
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateClone()</span>.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">void CopyMembers (NiObject*
pDest, <a href="NiCloningProcess.htm">NiCloningProcess</a>&amp;
kCloning)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CopyMembers</span> is a private function that is
used by the cloning system to copy and share data on a cloned
object. It is not virtual but should generally be defined in
subclasses. <span class="NDLSystemFont">CopyMembers</span> is
usually declared via the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDeclareClone</span> macro.</p><a name=
"Streaming" id="Streaming"></a>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Streaming</p>

<p>A brief description of each streaming function is provided
here. Full descriptions of each function can be found in the
<a href=
"../../Programmer/Object_Systems/Streaming_Internals.htm">streaming
internals documentation</a>. These functions are called by the
streaming system and should not be called by application code.
They are provided as reference for developers creating streamable
classes. These functions are usually declared via the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDeclareStream</span> or
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDeclareAbstractStream</span> macros
in <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStreamMacros.h</span>.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">virtual void LoadBinary(<a href=
"NiStream.htm">NiStream</a>&amp; kStream)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LoadBinary</span> is called on newly created
objects to load their data from disk. The order of loaded objects
should match the order in which objects are saved with
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SaveBinary</span>.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">virtual void LinkObject(<a href=
"NiStream.htm">NiStream</a>&amp; kStream)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LinkObject</span> is called by the streaming
system to resolve links to other objects once it can be
guaranteed that all objects have been loaded.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">virtual void
PostLinkObject(<a href="NiStream.htm">NiStream</a>&amp;
kStream)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PostLinkObject</span> is called by the streaming
system to resolve any tasks that require other objects to be
correctly linked. It is called by the streaming system after
<span class="NDLSystemFont">LinkObject</span> has been called on
all streamed objects.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">virtual bool
RegisterStreamables(<a href="NiStream.htm">NiStream</a>&amp;
kStream)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">When an object is inserted
into a stream, it calls register streamables to make sure that
any contained objects or objects linked in a scene graph are
streamed as well.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">virtual void SaveBinary(<a href=
"NiStream.htm">NiStream</a>&amp; kStream)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">The streaming system uses this
function to save objects to disk. The order of saved objects
should match the order of loaded objects in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LoadBinary</span>.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">virtual bool IsEqual(NiObject*
pkObject)</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">The IsEqual function is purely
for debugging, and the name slightly misleading. See the
streaming internals documentation.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">static NiObject*
CreateObject()</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">This static function is
registered by the streaming system to create instances of
objects. It is a very simple function that returns a new instance
of the object type.</p><a name="CloningBehavior" id=
"CloningBehavior"></a>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">CloningBehavior</p>

<p>This enumeration determines the behavior when cloning.</p>
