<h1>Stream Out in the NiD3D10Renderer</h1>

<p>Stream Output is a feature of the D3D10 API supported by
Gamebryo. It is a convenient way of processing vertex data and
saving it for later re-use.</p>

<p>For example, if you a very complex skinning or morphing facial
animation running in a vertex shader, the GPU would ordinarily
have to recompute this work every time it drew the mesh, which
can be many times per frame: in multiple shadow passes, in
perhaps a full-scene depth-only pass (to reduce overdraw), and
then in the final color pass. A better approach would be to do
this work only once per frame, and stream the results out to a
temporary ("stream output") buffer. All of your remaining passes
could then use that data, without having to recompute the vertex
locations every time you draw the mesh.</p>

<p>Stream Output does not require the use of geometry shaders;
however, when used with a geometry shader, the dynamic output of
the geometry shader opens up many interesting possibilities.</p>

<h2>D3D10 Constraints on output streams</h2>

<p>Output streams in D3D10 aren't quite as flexible as standard
input vertex streams. There are some limitations that D3D10
imposes on the output streams:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Only 32-bit data types are supported (float, int,
    uint).</li>

    <li>There are two ways of organize the streams:

        <ul>
            <li>Thin streams (struct-of-arrays) - a set of
            non-interleaved streams, with one stream for each
            output element

                <ul>
                    <li>Max 64 elements per vertex</li>

                    <li>Note that you can't use the HLSL command
                    Load to read a float3 stream, though you can
                    use Load on float1, float2, or float4
                    streams.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Fat or compound streams (array-of-structs) -
            streams consisting of a set of interleaved
            elements
                <ul>
                    <li>Max of 4 streams; one "element"
                    (&lt;=float4) each. (D3D10)</li>

                    <li>Note that you can't use the HLSL command
                    Load on these at all.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>The input to the Stream Out stage can be points, lines,
    or triangles, either in list or strip form; however, the
    output can only be lists. When you write an HLSL geometry
    shader, the instructions (Append() and RestartStrip()) make
    it seem like you are writing strips, but in reality, the
    strips are saved as lists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using Stream Output in Gamebryo</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Write a shader that uses Stream Output</h3>

<h4>NSF Shader</h4>

<p>The two things an NSF shader needs to enable stream output is
a declaration of the output streams, using a <a href=
"../../Programmer/NiShader/Stream_Output_Buffers.htm">StreamOutBuffer</a>
section in the NSFShader block, and a <a href=
"../../Programmer/NiShader/Stream_Output.htm">StreamOutput</a>
section in the Pass object that contains the vertex or geometry
shader that will be performing the stream output.</p>

<p>If you would like to only perform stream output operations
without doing any rasterization (color and/or depth operations),
this is simple. To disable pixel shading, remove the PSProgram {
} and PS_Constantmap { } blocks. To additionally disable
Z-buffering (including, often importantly, Z-write), set the
appropriate render states as well.</p>

<h4>Programmatic Shader</h4>

<p>If you are writing a shader from scratch, the overall
structure will be very similar. In order to declare your buffer
objects, you will need to create and populate an <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiOutputStreamDescriptor.htm"><span class="NDLSystemFont">
NiOutputStreamDescriptor</span></a> object and place it on your
<a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiShader.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span></a>. Then, to link the buffers
with the shader programs that will use them, create and populate
an <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiStreamOutSettings.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiStreamOutSettings</span></a> object and place
it on the appropriate <a href="NiD3D10Pass.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiD3D10Pass</span></a>.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Write the vertex or geometry shader that will export
the data</h3>

<p>You can use stream output with an ordinary vertex shader,
without modifications to the vertex shader itself. However,
stream output is much more powerful when used with a geometry
shader, which allows dynamic output (vertices can be culled or
"invented").</p>

<p>If you use an HLSL geometry shader, it must specify the stream
output. For example, in the example HLSL
geometry shader below, all triangles are passed through,
unchanged. However, you can modify the data
and/or output any number of triangles here, as long as the number
of vertices you write does not exceed .maxvertexcount'.</p>

<pre>
struct GS_OUTPUT
{
   float4 Pos     : SV_POSITION;
   float3 normal  : TEXCOORD0;
   float3 viewVec : TEXCOORD1;
};
 
[maxvertexcount (3)]
void StreamOutGS(
    inout TriangleStream&lt;GS_OUTPUT&gt; Stream,
    triangle VS_OUTPUT input[3])
{
    Stream.Append( SomeFunction(input[0]) );
    Stream.Append( SomeFunction(input[1]) );
    Stream.Append( SomeFunction(input[2]) );
    Stream.RestartStrip();
}
</pre>

<h3>Step 3: Render the resulting buffer</h3>

<p>You will usually want to write a second shader that will
render the results of your stream output to the screen.</p>

<p>This step is no different from writing an ordinary shader just
make sure the SemanticAdapterTable (which specifies the layout of
the shader's expected input streams) matches what you designed in
the stream output shader. Often, your application will
programmatically create an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span> that this
material will be used on.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add supporting code to the application</h3>

<p>First, identify the mesh (often in your scenegraph) that you
would like to use as the input to your Stream Output
operation.</p>

<pre>
NiAVObject* pkObject = m_spScene-&gt;GetObjectByName("Teapot01");
if (!(pkObject &amp;&amp; NiIsKindOf(NiMesh, pkObject)))
    return false;
NiMesh* pkSourceMesh = (NiMesh*)pkObject;
</pre>

<p>Next, if necessary, assign the Stream Output shader to it:</p>

<pre>
pkSourceMesh-&gt;ApplyAndSetActiveMaterial("MyStreamOutShader");
</pre>

<p>Next, create the "draw" mesh&mdash;it's just a proxy mesh,
used only to draw the results of our Stream Output operation. Its
input data streams will be mapped to the output data streams of
the source mesh.</p>

<pre>
// note: m_spStreamOutDrawMesh is of type NiMeshPtr.
m_spStreamOutDrawMesh = NiNew NiMesh();
m_spScene-&gt;AttachChild(m_spStreamOutDrawMesh);
</pre>

<p>And finally, we need to do the stream-binding between the two
meshes:</p>

<pre>
m_spStreamOutDrawMesh-&gt;BindToStreamOutputOf( pkSourceMesh );
</pre>

<p>The only remaining step is to clean up our code-created mesh,
upon exit:</p>

<pre>
// release smart pointer:
m_spStreamOutDrawMesh = NULL;
</pre>
