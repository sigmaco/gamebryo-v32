<h1>Safe Zone Rendering in the UI</h1>

<p>Output devices on different platforms all lose some amount of
output image data due to how the image is cast to the display
device. The amount of edge data lost can vary from almost none to
on the order of 10% of the visible width. While this may be
generally ignored when presenting image data to the screen, it
causes significant loss when presenting text as is common on UI
elements. This problem, factored with widely varying resolutions
across output devices led to a special "Safe Zone" rendering
implementation for all UI elements.</p>

<p>The safe zone portion of the screen may be defined as that
portion which is completely visible on an output device. In order
to maintain a similar look for the a single sample across
multiple platforms and resolutions, while maintaining the same
code, this safe zone was defined on a range from [0..1]. This
range is referred to as "Normalized Screen Coordinates" (NSC)
throughout the code. This is range covers a subspace of the
[0..1] space known as "Normalized Device Coordinates" (NDC) which
defines the entire area of the frame buffer. Using NSC, any demo
can define the location and size of a UI element using the same
coordinates and it will occupy the same amount of space and same
relative location on separate platforms and separate output
resolutions.</p>

provides the base functions used by this system for <a href=

rendering</a>.</p>
