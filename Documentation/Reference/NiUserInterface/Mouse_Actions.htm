<h1>Mouse Actions</h1>

<p>The mouse is available for Win32 platforms to control
navigation controls as well as UI elements. In order to easily
separate between when mouse actions are intended for UI control
vs. navigation control the following system was adopted:</p>

<p>In general, mouse motion is ignored by the navigation system.
It awaits a signal from the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiUIManager.htm">NiUIManager</a></span> that the mouse has
become available. This signal is sent when the left mouse button
is pressed and held over screen space not occupied by a UI
element, or occupied by a non-signal receiving UI element (e.g.
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiUILabel.htm">NiUILabel</a></span>s). Any mouse motion which
occurs while the left button is held after this event is sampled
by the navigation system. Upon the user releasing the left mouse
button, the navigation system receives a signal prompting it to
stop sampling mouse motion.</p>

<p>If an application uses only the UI system without the
navigation system, the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiUIManager.htm">NiUIManager</a></span> is written with the
above system for reserving mouse motion.</p>

<p>There is no way of using Gamepad analog axes for anything
other than navigation (when navigation is active) in the current
system.</p>
