                These keywords should be paired in code rather than using the standard new and
                delete for POD (plain-old-data) types. Examples of POD types are float, int,
                bool, and char. This lets Gamebryo route the memory
                requests through its internal allocation subsystem and store the file, line,
                function information depending on the build target. Using the EE_ALLOC macro on
                classes will compile, but will cause the class to not be initialized. A placement
                new operator would then be required to properly allocate the class. Similarly, using EE_FREE
                on classes will not invoke the destructor. Explicit invocation of the destructor via the ~CLASSNAME
                function will be required in this case.<br/>
                <br/>
                If users wish to allocate memory that does not go through the Emergent allocator, usage of 
                EE_EXTERNAL_NEW and EE_EXTERNAL_DELETE is recommended.

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Allocation Routines</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">EE_ALLOC(T, count)</p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to allocate memory for POD data types. The T is the type name, such as "unsigned int" and
"char". The count is the number of instances of that type needed.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">EE_ALIGNED_ALLOC(T, count, alignment)</p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to allocate memory for POD data types that have a non-standard alignment restriction. The T is the type name, such as "unsigned int" and
"char". The count is the number of instances of that type needed. The alignment parameter is the alignment in bytes required.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">EE_MALLOC(size)</p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to allocate memory for POD data types. The size is the total size of the allocation
in bytes. For cleanliness and readability EE_ALLOC is recommended for use instead.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">EE_REALLOC(memblock, size)</p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to reallocate memory for POD data types that were previously allocated with EE_MALLOC. 
The memblock value is the pointer that was previously allocated. The size is the total size of the allocation
in bytes. If size is 0, the EE_FREE is invoked and memblock is no longer valid.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">EE_ALIGNED_MALLOC(size, alignment)</p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to allocate memory for POD data types that have a non-standard alignment restriction.. The size is the total size of the allocation
in bytes. For cleanliness and readability EE_ALLOC is recommended for use instead. The alignment parameter is the alignment in bytes required.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">EE_ALIGNED_REALLOC(memblock, size, alignment)</p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to reallocate memory for POD data types that were previously allocated with EE_ALIGNED_MALLOC. 
The memblock value is the pointer that was previously allocated. The size is the total size of the allocation
in bytes. If size is 0, the EE_ALIGNED_FREE is invoked and memblock is no longer valid. The alignment parameter is the alignment in bytes required.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Allocation with MemHint Routines</p>

<p>There is an alternative versions of all of the above macros with a suffix of 2 (ex. EE_ALLOC2), that supports passing an additional argument, the <a href="../efd/efd__MemHint.htm">MemHint</a>. 
This can be used to assist in classifying the allocation.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Deallocation Routines</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">EE_FREE(p)</p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to deallocate memory for POD data types. The p parameter is the pointer to deallocate. This pointer
must have been allocated by Gamebryo using the EE_ALLOC, EE_ALLOC2, EE_REALLOC, EE_REALLOC2, EE_MALLOC, or EE_MALLOC2 macros.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">EE_FREE_KNOWN_SIZE(p, sizeInBytes)</p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to deallocate memory for POD data types. The p parameter is the pointer to deallocate.
This pointer must have been allocated by Gamebryo using the EE_ALLOC, EE_ALLOC2, EE_REALLOC, EE_REALLOC2, EE_MALLOC, or EE_MALLOC2 macros.
The sizeInBytes is a known size for the allocation, which can speed up deletion. It can also save memory if used in conjunction with the
MemoryHint parameter SIZE_PROVIDED_ON_DEALLOCATE. </p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">EE_ALIGNED_FREE(p)</p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to deallocate memory for POD data types. The p parameter is the pointer to deallocate. This pointer
must have been allocated by Gamebryo using the EE_ALIGNED_ALLOC, EE_ALIGNED_ALLOC2, EE_ALIGNED_REALLOC, EE_ALIGNED_REALLOC2, EE_ALIGNED_MALLOC, or EE_ALIGNED_MALLOC2 macros.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">EE_ALIGNED_FREE_KNOWN_SIZE(p, sizeInBytes)</p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to deallocate memory for POD data types. The p parameter is the pointer to deallocate.
This pointer must have been allocated by Gamebryo using the EE_ALIGNED_ALLOC, EE_ALIGNED_ALLOC2, EE_ALIGNED_REALLOC, EE_ALIGNED_REALLOC2, EE_ALIGNED_MALLOC, or EE_ALIGNED_MALLOC2 macros.
The sizeInBytes is a known size for the allocation, which can speed up deletion. It can also save memory if used in conjunction with the
MemoryHint parameter SIZE_PROVIDED_ON_DEALLOCATE. </p>


<p class="NDLRefHead2">External Tracking Routines</p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">EE_VERIFY_ADDRESS(x)</p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to verify that the memory address is known by the memory tracking system. In 
shipping builds, this will return false always.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">EE_TRACK_ALLOC(pointer, sizeInBytes)</p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to track an allocation that would otherwise be unknown to the memory tracking system.
In this macro, allocation occurred through some mechanism like EE_EXTERNAL_NEW. Pointer is the address of the
object to track. SizeInBytes is the size of the allocation.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">EE_TRACK_ALLOC2(pointer, sizeInBytes, hint) </p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to track an allocation that would otherwise be unknown to the memory tracking system.
In this macro, allocation occurred through some mechanism like EE_EXTERNAL_NEW. Pointer is the address of the
object to track. SizeInBytes is the size of the allocation. Hint is the memory hint associated with the allocation.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">EE_TRACK_FREE(pointer)</p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to track the deletion of an object previously noted in EE_TRACK_ALLOC or EE_TRACK_ALLOC2.</p>

<p class="NDLRefMemberFunction">EE_MEM_MARKER(markerType, classifier, string)</p>
<p class="NDLRefMemberDescription">Used to put a marker in the log for later examination. This can include things like which
file is being loaded and can be nested recursively. MarkerType can be either EE_MEM_MARKER_BEGIN or EE_MEM_MARKER_END. Classifier
is any high-level string you wish to use. A common classifier is __FUNCTION__. The final string is meta-data for use
in later mining, commonly the filename or other data.</p>
