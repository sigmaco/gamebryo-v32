<h2>Added Features, Changed Behavior, and Fixed Bugs</h2>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.2</h3>

<ul>
  <li>None in this release.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Stub libraries have been added in anticipation of full D3D11 support. These libraries are:
    <ul>
        <li>ecrD3D11Renderer</li>
        <li>ecrD3D11BinaryShaderLib</li>
        <li>ecrD3D11EffectShaderLib</li>
        <li>ecrD3D11RendererSetup</li>
    </ul>

  These libraries currently have no significant functionality, but they have be used to minimized the number of changes to the engine that will need to be made
  when full D3D11 support is released.
  </li>
  <li>Numerous code and data files have been updated to indicate support for D3D11 and offer D3D11-specific code paths.</li>
  <li>The default alignment for memory allocations has changed from 4 bytes to 16 bytes.</li>
  <li>Previous versions of Gamebryo recommended a specific Windows Platform SDK, i.e. "Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2". However, the version that ships with Visual Studio 2005 and onward is sufficient for building Gamebryo. If you previously installed the SDK for use with Gamebryo, please uninstall and update your Visual Studio directory settings to avoid build conflicts.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>None in this release.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.6.0</h3>

<ul>

  <li><b>Deprecation of Windows 2000 as a Runtime Platform</b>&mdash;Windows 2000 is no longer officially support as a runtime platform for Gamebryo. Though there is nothing in Gamebryo 2.6 that would prevent running on Windows 2000, no compatibility testing was performed on that platform. Future releases of Gamebryo may include changes that would prevent running on Windows 2000, including the use of APIs not available on that platform.</li>

  <li><b>Deprecation of the NiParallelUpdateTaskManager Class</b>&mdash;The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiParallelUpdateTaskManager.htm">NiParallelUpdateTaskManager</a></span> class is marked for deprecation in a future Gamebryo release. Its replacement is the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Programmer/NiFloodgate/Introduction_to_NiFloodgate.htm">NiFloodgate</a></span> library for parallel stream processing. Applications should not create any new code using <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiParallelUpdateTaskManager.htm">NiParallelUpdateTaskManager</a></span> functionality and should migrate existing code as soon as possible to use <a href="../../Programmer/NiMesh/Introduction_to_Mesh_Modifiers.htm">mesh modifiers</a> or Floodgate workflows directly.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.5.0</h3>

<h4>Visual Studio 7.1</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Support for Visual Studio VC7.1 project files and
    solutions has been discontinued in Gamebryo.</li>
</ul>

<h4>NiFont</h4>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFont</span> and
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFontCreator</span> have been
    extended to support italic typefaces.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFontCreator</span> can save
    the textures from fonts in a .tga file to allow artists to
    hand-edit the appearance of fonts or to use filters from
    external graphics tools. Additional "padding" space can be
    added around each glyph to give artists space to add this
    art, with optional guide boxes to let them know the valid
    region for each glyph.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFontCreator</span> can save
    a color into a font. At runtime, this will be multiplied by
    the color specified by the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Ni2DString</span> used to render the
    font.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFontString</span> has been
    extended to support leading and tracking (inter-character and
    inter-line spacing).</li>
</ul>

<h4>NiDI8InputSystem</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Extended <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiInput/NiDI8InputSystem.htm">NiDI8InputSystem</a></span>
    to use the XInput library to handle the Xbox360 game pad. The
    mouse, keyboard, and legacy game pads are still handled
    through DirectInput.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.3.0</h3>

<h4>Visual Studio 8 Project Settings</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Gamebryo's Visual Studio 8 project settings have been
    updated to disable C++ RTTI (/GR-), which Gamebryo does not
    make use of. This should result in some improvement in memory
    usage and performance.</li>
</ul><a name="Known_Issues_and_Limitations" id=
"Known_Issues_and_Limitations"></a>

<h2>Known Issues and Limitations</h2>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">MangledMetal</span> may 
    fail to build on the first try.  One or more Lua wrapper
    object files will fail to be found. Simply rerun the build.</li>
</ul>

<h3>All Releases</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Gamebryo DLLs are not signed, and as a result, a game
    that ships using Gamebryo DLLs will not pass the Games for
    Windows Technical Requirement 2.2. Applications built with
    static Gamebryo libraries will not run into this
    limitation.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFont</span> rendering may
    change color very slightly due to a change in the way colors
    are rounded. A red value of 0.5f was previously rendered as
    red value 128 in a 32-bit frame buffer, and now appears as
    red value 127.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFontCreator</span> does not
    support underlined or shadowed typefaces.</li>

    <li>It has been reported that on Vista, no tga file is written out when using the VC9 version
     of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFontCreator</span> tool with the texture atlas enabled,
     due to an &quot;Encountered an improper argument&quot; error.  However, the VC8 version of
     the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFontCreator</span> tool works correctly on Vista in all
     cases.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiDI8InputSystem::ConfigureDevices</span>
    function has the following problems:

        <ul>
            <li>It does not work at all on Vista</li>

            <li>It displays Xbox360 controllers, even though
            those controllers are not handled through DirectInput
            at all.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>With the release of the DX SDK (December 2006), the
    DirectX SDK no longer supports running on Windows 98 or
    Windows ME. Refer to the release notes <a href=
    "http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/xna/aa937789.aspx" target=
    "_blank">here</a> for more information. Since Gamebryo on the
    PC requires DirectX, Gamebryo is no longer supported on these
    platforms either.</li>

    <li>Windowed 3D applications running Gamebryo may experience
    periodic frame rate spikes under certain conditions. This is
    most likely the result of another application, such as one in
    the Windows system tray, updating its graphical
    representation. If you experience any problems like this, try
    the following to reduce or eliminate the stuttering:

        <ul>
            <li>Turn off all services/programs that animate
            system tray icons or taskbar items.</li>

            <li>Auto-hide the taskbar.</li>

            <li>Run the application in full screen, if
            supported.</li>

            <li>Run the taskbar on a different display device
            from the Gamebryo application.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Some dialogs are not visible in full-screen mode in DX9
    on Windows Vista. For example, checks for support of multiple
    render targets and MSAA with multiple render targets occur
    after the DX9 renderer has been created for several
    applications. A dialog is displayed indicating the lack of
    support, if that's the case, prior to application
    termination. With Windows XP, the dialog displays in front of
    the full-screen. However, with Windows Vista, the dialog
    displays behind the full-screen.</li>

    <li>Application Timing Problems with Dual-core Processors

        <ul>
            <li>Some motherboard/bios configurations for PCs with
            dual-core processors have a bug which can cause
            application timing problems, unless the /usepmtimer
            option is used in the PC's boot.ini file.</li>

            <li>The most obvious symptoms are animation
            slow-downs and speed-ups or inconsistent animation
            cycles.</li>

            <li>The /usepmtimer option (added to the boot.ini
            file) forces the Windows QPC function to read the
            precision timer that's built into the chipset,
            instead of reading the timestamp counter in the
            cpu(s). If the boot.ini file is not visible in
            Windows, uncheck the "Hide protected operating system
            files" check box on the View tab of the Folder
            Options dialog box in Windows.</li>

            <li><a href=
            "http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;895980"
            target="_blank">This MSDN link</a> describes details
            of how to make the fix. It refers to 64-bit Windows,
            but the problem can also apply to certain PCs running
            32-bit Windows.</li>

            <li>Users of Athlon. 64 X2 machines who continue to
            see animation speed problems after making the above
            fix should also install the latest <a href=
            "http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/TechnicalResources/0,,30_182_871_13118,00.html"
            target="_blank">AMD Athlon. 64 X2 Dual Core Processor
            Driver</a>.</li>
