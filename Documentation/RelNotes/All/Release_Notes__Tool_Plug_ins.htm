<a name="Added_Features_and_Fixed_Bugs" id="Added_Features_and_Fixed_Bugs"></a><h2>Added Features, Changed Behavior, and Fixed Bugs</h2>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.2</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue which could sometimes cause the mesh instancing plug-in to delete meshes from
    an exported scene.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
    Fixed some issues with per-sequence and per-object-per-sequence animation compression that could cause it to not compress or even expand the size of data stored.
    </li>
</ul>
    
<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Changed the behavior of the on-target viewers to adjust the aspect ratio of all cameras
    found in the scene to match the aspect ratio of the display monitor. Previously, only the
    default camera was adjusted, and any exported cameras were left at their original aspect ratio
    (typically 4:3).</li>

    <li>The <a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Scene_Graph_Optimization.htm">SceneGraphOptimization</a> tool
    was modified to have an option to remove partial path names. The names of nodes were changed so
    that they are always unique within a single scene. If this is not desired you can set this
    option to shorten the name to only be that of the object.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue with the PS3 on-target viewer where it failed to unregister the TTY callback
    when shut down (which would manifest as an error dialog reporting "Failed to register TTY
    stream").</li>

    <li><a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Stripify_Geometry.htm">Stripify Geometry</a> plug-in
    will be deprecated in the next release. Vertex cache optimization process that is done in the
    <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Scene_Graph_Optimization.htm">SceneGraphOptimization</a>
    plug-in is a superior alternative.</li>

    <li>Fixed a random crash bug during the vertex cache optimization phase.</li>

    <li>Added the <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Material_Modifier.htm">Material Modifier
    Plug-in</a>.</li>

    <li>Removed n-squared sized allocation from animation compression increasing export
    efficiency.</li>

    <li>Added <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/ThumbnailGenerator.htm">ThumbnailGenerator</a>
    tool plug-in to generate thumbnails for previewing in the tools and the Windows shell.</li>

    <li>Fixed a bug in code used by <a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Scene_Graph_Optimization.htm">Scene Graph Optimization</a> that
    was causing sibling mesh objects to be incorrectly merged, despite having different extra data.
    This sometimes caused incorrect export of PhysX collision shapes, among other things.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.6</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX Extractor</a> tool
    plug-in marks meshes as non-optimizable if PhysX requires the vertex ordering to remain
    unchanged. This enables <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX
    Extractor</a> and <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Scene_Graph_Optimization.htm">Scene
    Graph Optimization</a> to be used in any order.</li>

    <li>Modified the <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Controller_Extractor.htm">Controller
    Extractor</a> plug-in such that it generates KF files which contain <a href=
    "../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm"><span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span></a> objects instead of <a href=
    "../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiControllerSequence.htm"><span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span></a> objects. Gamebryo 2.6 utilizes two classes to
    represent animated sequences: <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> and
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>. <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span> objects contain the shareable, heavyweight data of
    exported animation sequences saved in KF files. <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span> objects are temporary runtime entities created upon
    sequence activation. These lighter weight objects maintain instance-based state to play back
    the animated sequence on a particular actor. Older versions of Gamebryo utilized a single
    class, also named <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerSequence</span>, which handled both
    the shareable data as well as the instance-based state. This improvement reduces the runtime
    memory footprint when sequences are shared by multiple characters. To enhance runtime
    performance the new sequence format relies upon <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiEvaluator.htm">NiEvaluator</a></span> objects as opposed to
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiInterpolator.htm">NiInterpolator</a></span> objects for sampling
    sequence animation data. Gamebryo 2.6 supports KF files from Gamebryo 1.2 and later. If needed,
    Gamebryo automatically converts to the new <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSequenceData</span>
    format during the loading process.</li>

    <li>The <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Ragdoll.htm">PhysX Ragdoll</a> tool
    plug-in no longer makes any assumption about the ordering of actors in a joint when setting
    actor parent pointers. This fixes problems with excessive jerkiness in some rag-dolls.</li>

    <li>Modified the <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Controller_Extractor.htm">Controller
    Extractor</a> plug-in such that during animation compression, specifying a compression override
    per sequence or object will properly override the global compression settings.</li>

    <li>Changed the <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Controller_Extractor.htm">Controller
    Extractor</a> plug-in such that it no longer consolidates <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiTransformController.htm">NiTransformController</a></span>
    objects into a single <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiMultiTargetTransformController.htm">NiMultiTargetTransformController</a></span>.
    Instead, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTransformController</span> objects are removed from the
    scene graph. These controllers are no longer required for sequence animation since the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiMultiTargetPoseHandler.htm">NiMultiTargetPoseHandler</a></span>
    communicates directly with scene graph transform nodes.</li>

    <li>Modified how the <a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Controller_Extractor.htm">Controller Extractor</a> plug-in
    handles the transform on the accumulation root in NIF files. The plug-in moves the transform on
    the accumulation root to its non-accumulation child node such that the root's transform is
    always identity within the NIF file. This change in behavior makes the transforms stored in NIF
    files consistent with any exported sequences. By definition, the NIF file stores a constant
    scene graph (i.e. a pose rather than an animation). Since poses never use accumulation flags
    the accumulation root in the NIF file must have an identity transform.</li>

    <li>Removed from the <a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Controller_Extractor.htm">Controller Extractor</a> plug-in the
    ability to store controllers in KF files. This option had previously been provided to generate
    KF files that were compatible with NIF files exported from a version earlier than Gamebryo 1.2.
    Pre-1.2 NIF files did not contain any time controllers for their sequence objects; the KF files
    did instead. In contrast, Gamebryo 1.2 NIF files contain the time controllers and the KF files
    do not (they only contain interpolators). The KF files produced by the Controller Extractor are
    compatible with NIF files from Gamebryo 1.2 and later. This bumped the plug-in version to
    2.6.</li>

    <li>When specifying a compression setting per object or sequence in the <a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Controller_Extractor.htm">Controller Extractor</a> plug-in, that
    setting will now override the global compression setting in all cases. Previously, if the
    global compression setting specified 'no compression,' the override would not be applied.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.5</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Updated the <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Fur_Generator.htm"><span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Fur Generator Plug-in</span></a> to be a generic fur generation utility.</li>

    <li>Fixed the <a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Save_Source_Texture_Renderer_Data.htm"><span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Save Source Texture Renderer Data</span></a> plug-in to work properly with
    <a href="../../Tools/Tool_Plug_in_Batch_Tool/Tool_Plug_in_Batch_Tool_Intro.htm"><span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Tool Plug-in Batch</span></a>.</li>

    <li>Added an option to the <a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Controller_Extractor.htm">Controller Extractor</a> tool plug-in
    to enable the removal of <a href=
    "../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSResetOnLoopCtlr.htm">NiPSResetOnLoopCtlr</a> objects from
    particle systems involved in sequences, thus disabling particle system looping.</li>

    <li>Added <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Mesh_Finalize.htm">MeshFinalize</a></span> plug-in to facilitate
    the <a href="../../Art/Other/Introduction_to_Mesh_Profiles.htm">Mesh Profile System</a>.</li>

    <li>Updated <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Scene_Graph_Optimization.htm">SceneGraphOptimization</a></span>
    and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Create_ABV.htm">CreateABV</a></span> plug-ins to support new
    <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh_Rel_Notes.htm">NiMesh</a> <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">library</span>.</li>

    <li>Added vertex cache and view independent optimizations to the <a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Scene_Graph_Optimization.htm"><span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">SceneGraphOptimization</span></a> plug-in. This optimization is mutually
    exclusive with stripification and generally gives better performance so using vertex cache
    optimization instead of stripification is recommended and the new default behavior.</li>

    <li>Corrected the behavior of the Cancel button on the <a href=
    "../../Tools/Tool_Plug_in_Testbed/The_Script_Editor_Dialog.htm">script editor dialog</a>. The
    Cancel button now leaves the original script unchanged regardless of what is done in the dialog
    before cancel is used. Operations such as adding new scripts or renaming scripts are not
    affected by this change.</li>

    <li>Changed <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Multi-NIF_Exporter.htm">Multi NIF Exporter</a></span> to insert
    any cameras within the sub scene to be exported into the stream after the scenegraph in order
    to make behavior match that of the NIF Exporter.</li>

    <li>Removed "Triangle to Strip Ratio" check from <a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Asset_Analyzer.htm">AssetAnalyzer</a> plug-in. Since the
    <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Stripify_Geometry.htm">Stripify Geometry</a> plug-in
    uses degenerate triangles to connect meshes instead of creating additional strips, this check
    is no longer necessary.</li>

    <li>Removed deprecated scene statistics feature from <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Scene_Viewer_D3D.htm">Scene Viewer D3D</a></span>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.3.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added the ability to the <a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Controller_Extractor.htm">Controller Extractor</a> plug-in to
    exclude specified types of controllers from being included in sequences. This bumped the
    plug-in version to 2.3.</li>

    <li>The <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Stripify_Geometry.htm">Stripify Geometry</a>
    plug-in now ensures that portal object dependencies are honored when replacing meshes with
    stripified meshes.</li>

    <li>Added the ability to launch the <a href=
    "../../Tools/PhysX_NIF_Viewer/Introduction_to_the_PhysX_NIF_Viewer.htm">PhysX Nif Viewer</a> on
    Xbox directly from Max or Maya. See the documentation for the <a href=
    "../../ee_goto.htm#Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Xbox_360_Viewer.htm">Xbox 360 Viewer</a> tool
    plug-in.</li>

    <li>Added the ability to launch the <a href=
    "../../Tools/PhysX_NIF_Viewer/Introduction_to_the_PhysX_NIF_Viewer.htm">PhysX Nif Viewer</a> on
    PS3 directly from Max or Maya. See the documentation for the <a href=
    "../../ee_goto.htm#Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PS3_Viewer.htm">PS3 Viewer</a> tool plug-in.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.2.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed issue where <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Scene_Graph_Optimization.htm">Scene Graph
    Optimization</a></span> plug-in would inappropriately remove UV texture sets from instanced
    geometry.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue where <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Portal_Converter.htm">Portal Converter</a></span> <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">plug-in</span> would not always identify tagged portals exported from
    Maya.</li>

    <li>Fixed memory leaks occurring in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Portal_Converter.htm">Portal Converter</a> plug-in</span>.</li>

    <li>Fixed issue in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Portal_Converter.htm">Portal Converter</a> plug-in</span> where
    lights that affected rooms would loose their targets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.2.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Modified the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/NIF_Exporter.htm">NifExporter</a></span> and <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/NIF_Importer.htm">NifImporter</a></span>
    tool plug-ins to support streaming extra objects outside of the scene graph. The version number
    of these plug-ins has been updated accordingly.</li>

    <li>A new <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Save_Source_Texture_Renderer_Data.htm">SaveSourceTextureRendererData</a></span>
    plug-in has been added, in support of new capabilities for direct-loading textures on supported
    platforms. This functionality is designed to increase loading performance, reduce the load-time
    memory footprint, improve general memory usage, and allow for platform-specific extensions. See
    also <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Programmer/Object_Systems/Streaming.htm#TextureStreamingOptions">Texture Streaming
    Options</a></span> for Internal Textures, the export options for <a href=
    "../../Art/Max/Gamebryo_3ds_max_Export_Options1.htm">3ds max</a> or <a href=
    "../../Art/Maya/Export_Display_Options.htm">Maya</a>, and the description of <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiMain/NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData.htm">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</a></span>
    in the Main Class Reference for more details.</li>

    <li>Added the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Cleaner.htm">PhysX Cleaner</a></span> tool plug-in to
    remove the extra data produced when PhysX content is exported from Max or Maya but is not
    required by the application.</li>

    <li>Added the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX Extractor</a></span> tool plug-in to
    export PhysX content authored in Max or Maya.</li>

    <li>Added the <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Ragdoll.htm">PhysX Maya Ragdoll</a>
    tool plug-in to help with setting up rag-dolls in Maya. The tool plug-in re-associates PhysX
    actors with skeleton bones.</li>

    <li>Added the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_NIF_Viewer.htm">PhysX NIF Viewer</a></span> viewer plug-in
    to launch the <a href=
    "../../Tools/PhysX_NIF_Viewer/Introduction_to_the_PhysX_NIF_Viewer.htm">PhysX NIF Viewer</a>
    tool for previewing PhysX content.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.1.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug in the <a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Controller_Extractor.htm">Controller Extractor</a> export
    plug-in that could result in a crash upon export if some sequences don't get created because
    they don't contain any animation keys but other sequences do. Now, an export error is output
    listing the sequences that did not created.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.0.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Addressed two issues in the Xenon On-Target Viewer that were causing failure of file copies
    to the remote Xenon development console.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.0.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Removed all <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSceneGamePad</span> related code from the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">SceneViewerDX9DLL</span> plug-in. This code has been deprecated for
    several releases and has been known to cause crashes on certain models of consumer PC
    gamepads.</li>

    <li>Removed many platform-specific plugins and tool libraries for platforms that are no longer
    supported, such as <span class="NDLSystemFont">SceneViewerDX8DLL</span>, <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">TextureSwizzleDLL</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureSwizzle</span>
    and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiExportPlatformGeometry</span>, and the on-target viewers for
    the unsupported consoles.</li>

    <li>Added support for animation compression to <a href=
    "../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Controller_Extractor.htm"><span class="NDLSystemFont">Controller
    Extractor</span></a>.</li>

    <li>Replaced _access with <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFile::Access</span> in <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NifExporter</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiControllerExtractor</span>
    plugins.</li>

    <li>Added a new method to NiPlugin that determines whether or not the plugin can instantiate a
    default version of its options. This allows a plug-in to not appear in the UI for adding a new
    plug-in to a script.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">PortalConverterDLL</span> has been rewritten for this
    release and has been assigned the version number 2.0. It now uses a more robust convex hull
    finder, which results in more accurate and simpler room definitions (i.e. fewer wall objects
    per room). It can also handle multiple independently-tagged room groups per file/scene.
    Finally, a bug that caused manually-tagged walls to be ignored has been fixed, allowing artists
    to avoid automatic wall generation and generate an optimal set of wall planes manually.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Known_Issues_and_Limitations" id="Known_Issues_and_Limitations"></a><h2>Known Issues and Limitations</h2>

<h3>MaterialModifier</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The MaterialModifier plugin will not resize compressed (dds) textures unless a full mipmap
    pyramid is supplied within the texture.</li>
</ul>

<h3>MultiNifExport</h3>

<ul>
    <li>If MultiNif Export is used in conjunction with Scene Graph Optimizations, it is possible
    for the resulting NIF to have an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> as a root level
    object. For some systems, this can be problematic. To work ensure that the top level object is
    an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span>, from within the art package, tag any node
    destined for MultiNif export with <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiOptimizeKeep</span>. This will
    ensure that the node is not optimized out.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Controller Extractor</h3>

<ul>
    <li>If a sequence is set to accumulate rotations and its "front facing" axis is not the
    positive x-axis, the Controller Extractor plug-in will modify the animation keys appropriately
    to ensure that the sequence will work well with other sequences that do not accumulate
    rotations about that axis. If your accumulation root has a nonzero local rotation around the
    non-accumulated axes, then this process may incorrectly calculate the modified animation keys.
    To avoid this, ensure that the accumulation root for your character has identity rotations on
    all axes except the accumulated axis.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mesh Instancing</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Gamebryo currently does not support hardware skinning and mesh instanced objects. If the
    plug-in detects meshes that have hardware skinning attached they will be ignored. CPU skinned
    objects are supported.</li>

    <li>Morphed objects and CPU skinned objects in a scene that are instances (exact copies) will
    always be converted to hardware instances, with the result that all the instances have exactly
    the same animation at runtime. In effect, there is only one object that remains for animation
    purposes, and all the others are copies. Do not use the Mesh Instancing plug-in if you would
    like independently controlled morphed or CPU skinned objects, or model the morphed and skinned
    objects in a separate file from the object you would like hardware instanced.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Normal Unifier</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The Normal Unifier only works if the two adjacent objects which are to have their normals
    unified share the same world transform.</li>
</ul>
