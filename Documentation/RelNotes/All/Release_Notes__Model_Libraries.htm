<h1>Entity Model Libraries Release Notes</h1>

<a name="Added_and_Changed_Models" id="Added_and_Changed_Models"></a><h2>Added and Changed Models</h2>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.2</h3>

<ul>The <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Actor.htm">Actor</a>,
    <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Mesh.htm">Mesh</a>,
    <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Placeable.htm">Placeable</a>,
    <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Renderable.htm">Renderable</a>
    <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/PhysXModelLibrary__PhysXScene.htm">PhysXScene</a>
    models have been converted to built-ins. <em>All models should be re-exported by opening each
    EMT project in Toolbench and selecting "Save" from the File menu.</em> Toolbench does not
    automatically detect the switch to a built-in model, so commands that save only changed models
    are not adequate. Failure to re-save models that mix-in new built-ins will result in incorrect
    entity behavior.
</ul>

<h4>Standard Model Library</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The Position, Rotation and Scale properties of an entity with the 
    <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Actor.htm">Actor</a>
    model now contain the pose of the accumulation root node of an animated character
    that has such a node (characters with active accumulation). This information is
    updated on a frame-by-frame basis as the character moves. When these properties are
    set in non-tool mode they set the root of the scene graph such that the actor's
    accumulation root will move to the desired location. Furthermore, we discourage
    the use of geometry in a NIF file that is unaffected by the accumulation root, as such
    geometry will not be in the pose reported by the Placeable properties.</li>

    <li>The IsKfmAssetShared property of the 
    <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Actor.htm">Actor</a>
    model is now ignored. All actors are shared.</li>

    <li><a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Actor.htm">Actor</a>
    now mixes in <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Nameable.htm">
    Nameable</a>, to help with debugging at run-time.</li>
</ul>    

<h4>PhysX Model Library</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/PhysXModelLibrary__PhysXScene.htm">
    PhysXScene</a> model gained the SimActive read-only property for determining if
    a simulation time step is currently in progress.</li>
</ul>    


<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1</h3>

<h4>Standard Model Library</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The entity asset preloading system has been substantially changed. See the description of
    the new <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Preloadable.htm">Preloadable</a></span>
    model and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/egf/egf__EntityManager.htm">egf::EntityManager</a></span> for more details.
    <em>All flat models will need to be re-exported</em>.</li>
    <li>The bindings in bapiLua::LuaTraits have been improved to provide additional type safety.
    Previously crashes could result from passing incompatible data to a built-in API method but now
    these cases should simply generate a Lua error with a descriptive error string.</li>

	<li>The following additions have been made to the Standard Model Library in regards to lighting:
		<ul>
			<li>Added a Lightable model, which specifies the maximum number of lights by type an entity can support. Defaults to a maximum of 3 point, 2 spot, and 3 directional lights.</li>
			<li>Added a UpdateLightingOnMove property to the Light model. When this is set to false (default), adjusting any of the light's properties will not force lighting to be recomputed for all entities.</li>
			<li>Added a LightPriority property to the Light model. The Light Service now computes the 'influence' of a light on an entity, which takes its priority into account. When choosing which lights will affect an entity, lights with the greatest influence win.</li>
			<li>Added support for explicit Always Affected/Never Affected lists to the Light model. This allows you to manually override lighting.</li>
	 </ul>
   </li>
  
  	<li>The Light Service will now only consider light entities that mix-in the Lightable model 
	for lighting. The Standard Model Library has been updated so that the Actor, Mesh, and Terrain
	models now mix-in the Lightable model. Applications will need to update their local copy of 
	the StandardModelLibrary with the shipped StandardModelLibrary. If you do not make this update,
	the Light Service will ignore all entities, and nothing will be affected by lights.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The Entity Model Libraries are new in this release.</li>
