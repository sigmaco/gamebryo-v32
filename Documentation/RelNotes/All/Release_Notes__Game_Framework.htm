<h1>Game Framework Release Notes</h1>

<a name="Added_Features_and_Fixed_Bugs" id="Added_Features_and_Fixed_Bugs"></a>
<h2>Added Features, Changed Behavior, and Fixed Bugs</h2>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.2</h3>

<h4>Entity and behavior</h4>
<ul>
<li>New entity lifecycles were added for OnEnterWorld and OnExitWorld. By default created entities
    will automatically enter the world in order to match legacy behavior, but may optionally be
    created out of the world in order to better control when they begin to render and simulate.
    Entities can be moved in and out of the world as many times as needed and the corresponding
    lifecycles will execute on each transition. For further details, see
    <a href="../../Programmer/Entities/entity_lifecycle.htm">Entity Lifecycles</a>.</li>

<li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">EntityManager</span> now sends two new local messages to inform
    services as to when entities enter or exit the world. Services should consider listening to
    these new messages instead of the current entity added and removed messages in order to avoid
    spending time simulating entities that are out of the world. For details on these new messages,
    see the <a href="..\..\Reference\QuickRef_Services\svc_qckref_entity_mgr.htm">Entity Manager
    Quick Reference</a>.</li>

<li>The OnCreate behavior now has an optional boolean parameter, named "AutoEnterWorld," to inform
    the behavior whether the entity will automatically enter the world after OnCreate finishes. This
    parameters is automatically handled by the framework itself so there is no required action.
    This parameter can also be passed to various Entity creation methods such as <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">BehaviorAPI.CreateEntity</span> from script or to <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    EntityManager::CreateEntity</span> from C++ to turn auto-entry on or off when dynamically
    creating entities.</li>

<li>Many memory growths during block loading have been fixed. Memory was previously being held
    until shut down that should have been freed once the block was loaded.</li>

<li>Callbacks associated with block loading and unloading are now more reliably invoked. In
    particular, the callbacks used when a block was first loaded will now receive all messages
    associated with the unloading of a block. Typically this means that the call to unload a block
    will not need to pass a callback unless that callback is different from the one used when
    loading the block. Using the same callback for both load and unload will now result in the
    callback being invoked twice.</li>

<li>When asynchronously creating an entity from either C++ or script you can now optionally provide
    a list of initial property values that should be set on the entity as soon as it is created. In
    many cases this can remove the need to implement an OnCreate behavior which provides improved
    performance. For further details, see <a href="../../Programmer/Entities/entity_creating.htm">
    Creating entities</a>.</li>

<li>One entity may now be attached to another, so that its position will track that of the
    target entity. The target must have a scene graph for this to functionality to be available,
    while the attached entity simply requires the Placeable model. See the documentation for
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/ecr/ecr__SceneGraphService.htm">ecr::SceneGraphService</a></span>,
    the built-in script function <span class="NDLSystemFont">AttachEntity</span> in
    <a href="../../Reference/Namespaces/bapiCoreRuntime.htm">the ecr bindings</a> and an
    <a href="../../Programmer/Entity_Interaction/entity_interaction_examples.htm">example</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Built-in Models</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Two new macros (EE_BUILTINMODELPROPERTY_ACCESSOR_REF and EE_BUILTINMODELPROPERTY_READONLY_ACCESSOR_REF) were
    added to egf::BuiltinModelHelper.h to support 'Get' accessors that return properties by const reference instead of
    by value. This is used to avoid unnecessary temporary variables when returning these property values. For example,
    efd::utf8string properties can now be returned by const reference in 'Get' built-in model property accessor methods.
     See the <a href=
    "../../Convert/Previous/Converting_to_Gamebryo_3_2_Overview.htm#BuiltinModelAccessorReturnValues">Conversion Guide</a> for
    details.</li>
    
    <li>The <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Placeable.htm">Placeable</a>
    model is built-in in this release. The built-in provides a callback interface that services
    may subscribe to for notifications of Placeable property changes. This avoids the need for
    services to handle entity update messages for position properties. The built-in also provides
    functionality to set the Placeable properties directly. Services may use this if they move
    entities in C++ code; it provides a mechanism to set the value and not receive the callback,
    which simplifies calling code. Currently, the Scene Graph Service and the Animation Service
    make use of this functionality.</li>

    <li>The <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Renderable.htm">Renderable</a>
    model is built-in in this release. The built-in provides a callback interface that services
    may subscribe to for notifications of Renderable property changes. This avoids the need for
    services to handle entity update messages for Renderable properties. The built-in also provides
    functionality to set the Renderable properties directly. Services may use this if they adjust
    the visibility of entities in C++ code; it provides a mechanism to set the value and not
    receive the callback, which simplifies calling code.</li>

    <li>A new
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/egf/egf__IPropertyCallbackInvoker.htm">IPropertyCallbackInvoker</a></span>
    class has been added to provide common callback functionality for
    built-in models that use callbacks to notify other systems of property changes. This class is useful
    in cases where a built-in model is primarily a data container while some other system is responsible
    for responding to property changes. It is used by the Placeable and Renderable built-in models.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Lua Scripting</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The DataStream module was replaced by the ParameterList module. Existing DataStreams passed
	to Lua functions must be converted to using the new ParameterList module.  See the
	<a href="../../Convert/Previous/DataStream_Deprecation.htm">DataStream Deprecation</a> conversion
	guide for details.</li>
	
    <li>Foundation utility types used as Entity property types are now bound directly in Lua. The
        following classes now have Lua functionality similar to their C++ counterparts: Point2,
        Point3, Point4, Color, ColorA, Matrix3, and Quaternion. See the <a href=
        "../../Programmer/Scripting/scripting_intro.htm">Lua Scripting</a> section for more details.
        These changes require additional defines when compiling SWIG-generated wrapper files.  See
        the <a href=
        "../../Convert/Previous/Converting_to_Gamebryo_3_2_Overview.htm#ExternalSWIGLuaRuntime">
        Conversion Guide</a> for details.</li>
    
    <li>The 'point3.lua' script found in Media/Samples/Common/Lua has been removed. Functionality
        found in this script was incorporated into the Point3 class exposed directly in Lua. See the
        <a href="../../Convert/Previous/Converting_to_Gamebryo_3_2_Overview.htm#Point3LuaRemoval">
        Conversion Guide</a> for details.</li>

    <li>Entities are now bound directly in Lua. Applications that previously used the EntityID as a
        UInt64 should switch to the new Lua Entity proxies. See the <a href=
        "../../Convert/Previous/Converting_to_Gamebryo_3_2_Overview.htm#AutoconversionEntityID">
        Conversion Guide</a> for details.</li>

    <li>Lua scripts ending with a comment no longer have trouble running.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_entity_loader_svc.htm">EntityLoaderService</a></h4>
<ul>
    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/egf/egf__EntityLoaderService.htm">
    egf::EntityLoaderService</a></span> has been significantly improved to more reliably send the
    expected callback messages. Notably, the callbacks used when a block is loaded will now be
    notified when the block is unloaded regardless of how the block is unloaded.</li>
    <li>The same block file can now be loaded multiple times by specifying an instance number. See
    <a href="../../Programmer/Blocks/block_loading.htm">Loading Blocks</a> for details.</li>
    <li>A block can be optionally rotated or offset when loaded. Any rotation or offset provided
    will be applied to every entity in the block that mixes-in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    Positionable</span> standard model.</li>
    <li>When loading a block you can now specify which callback results should send a message or
    invoke a behavior. For example, you may only wish to be notified in the event of failure or you
    may wish to avoid receiving block loading progress messages.</li>
    <li>All block loading options can be specified when loading blocks from script.</li>
    <li>For additional details on block loading options including C++ and scripting examples, see
    <a href="../../Programmer/Blocks/block_options.htm">Block Loading Options</a>.</li>
    <li>New documentation has been added covering block files in more detail and offing advice for
    using block files. See <a href="../../Programmer/Blocks/block_intro.htm">Block Files:
    Introduction</a> for a listing of available block documentation.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_scene_graph_svc.htm">Scene Graph Service</a></h4>

<ul>
    <li>The Scene Graph Service was modified to make use of the
        <a href="../../Reference/ecr/ecr__MeshModel.htm">Mesh built-in model</a>. An entity
        with such a model is now detected when the built-in is added to the entity, and the process
        of loading assets for the entity begins at that point. This is earlier in the entity
        life cycle than the prior behavior. Similary, entity removal for Mesh-based entities is
        detected when the Mesh built-in is removed from the entity.
        </li>

    <li>The Scene Graph Service was modified to make use of the
        <a href="../../Reference/egf/egf__PlaceableModel.htm">Placeable built-in model</a>
        and now uses the callback mechanism to handle updates to entity pose. An additional parameter has
        been added to the various API calls that add entity scene graphs to disable the pose update
        for such entities. Pose update should be disabled if the service adding the entity itself
        handles callbacks from the Placeable model. For example, the Animation Service disables
        Scene Graph Service Placeable updates so that it can apply updates to the accumulation root
        of an animated character instead of the NIF root.</li>
    
    <li>The Scene Graph Service was modified to make use of the
        <a href="../../Reference/ecr/ecr__RenderableModel.htm">Renderable built-in model</a>
        and now uses the callback mechanism to handle updates to entity visibility.</li>

    <li>Added a new
        <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/ecr/ecr__IAttachedObjectsProperty.htm">IAttachedObjectsProperty</a></span>
        class to hold data for built-in models that include the properties for attaching Nif
        Objects to a scene graph.
        </li>

    <li>A new API method, <span class="NDLSystemFont">EnablePlaceableFeedback</span>, has been
        added. Placeable Feedback sets the properties of a Placeable model (on any entity) to match
        the pose of a given scene graph node, which may be located anywhere in a scene graph. A
        corresponding <span class="NDLSystemFont">DisablePlaceableFeedback</span> was also added.
        The Placeable Feedback functionality should be used by other services that wish to have an
        entity track a particular scene graph node. It provides a method for attaching one entity to
        another, with the potential for no frame lag in the update. The Animaiton Service uses this
        functionality to receive updated accumulation root locations and hence report the actual
        position of the character as the entity's position.</li>
    
    <li>The service was modified to handle entity Enter/Exit world events. An entity is known to
        the service and may be accessed by other services even when out of world, but it is not
        rendered or updated when out of world.</li>

    <li>Added the <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetEntityFromSceneGraphNode</span> method to provide
        the entity that holds a given node anywhere in its scene graph.</li>
 
    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateSceneGraphUnmanaged</span> method has been renamed to
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateExternalSceneGraph</span> to better reflect its
        functionality. The method also gained a parameter to enable updating of the external scene
        graph.</li>

    <li>Almost all of the methods in the Scene Graph Service that took an
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">egf::EntityID</span> now take
        an <span class="NDLSystemFont">egf::Entity*</span> instead.</li>
    
    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">FlushUnusedPreloadedAssets</span> method has been removed
        because it serves no purpose. Unneeded assets will be removed when the entity using them is
        removed, or they are explicitly un-cached.</li>

    <li>Internal code for managing rapid iteration of NIF assets has been moved from the Scene Graph
        Service into the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
        "../../Reference/ecr/ecr__SceneGraphCache.htm">SceneGraphCache.htm</a></span> class in order
        to simplify the Scene Graph Service implementation.</li>
        
    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/ecr/ecr__SceneGraphService.htm">
    SceneGraphService::GetEntityFromObject</a></span> function has been fixed and now works as
    documented.
    </li>
    
</ul>

<h4><a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_animation_svc.htm">Animation Service</a></h4>

<ul>
    <li>The Animation Service asset handling code has been completely re-written to simplify the
        implementation. Some changes to the APIs and behavior resulted from this:
        <ul>
            <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Cache</span> member function changed to fill a
                vector of handles to cached actors. See the <a href=
                "../../Convert/Previous/Converting_to_Gamebryo_3_2_Overview.htm">Conversion
                Guide</a> for information on this change.</li>

            <li>The code for loading and rapidly iterating on Actor releated assets has been moved
                to the new
                <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/egmAnimation/egmAnimation__KFMCache.htm">egmAnimation::KFMCache</a></span>
                class. A method has been added to the Animation Service to obtain the cache object.</li>
                
            <li>Memory usage will increase slightly as the cache holds an unmodified copy of every
                actor, whereas previously one entity's actor served as the unmodified copy.</li>
            
            <li>Calls to set the current active animation should always be routed through the
            animation service rather than directly setting the
            <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> active animation. Failure to use
            Animation Service functionality will result in failure to maintain the
            active sequence across rapid iteration events.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>The Animation Service now handles
        <a href="../../Programmer/Entities/entity_lifecycle.htm">Entity Enter/Exit world</a>. Entities are created when their
        <a href="../../Reference/egmAnimation/egmAnimation__ActorModel.htm">Actor built-in model</a>
        is added to the entity, and removed when the Actor built-in is removed.
        However, the actors are not displayed nor updated until EntityEnterWorld occurs. Note that
        the target animation may be set when the entity is out of world and it will apply when the
        entity enters the world.</li>

    <li>The Position, Rotation and Scale properties of an entity with the <a href=
        "../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Actor.htm">Actor</a> model now
        contain the pose of the accumulation root node of an animated character that has such a node
        (characters with active accumulation). This information is updated on a frame-by-frame basis
        as the character moves. See <a href="Release_Notes__Model_Libraries.htm">Model Library
        Release Notes</a> for more information. The Animation Service class gained a tool mode
        argument to its constructor in order to disable this new feature in tools.</li>

    <li>The Actor Added message is only sent when the scene graph for the actor is
        successfully set. The Actor Removed message is sent when the scene graph for the actor
        is removed. Hence, rapid iteration of an actor's scene graph will result in Actor Added
        and Actor Removed messages even when the KFM file does not change on disk.</li>
        
    <li>Actor Add and Removed messages are now sent on a special category that may be obtained
        using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetMessageCategory</span> method in the Animation
        Service class. Services that receieve such messages must subscribe to the new category
        after the Animation Service has had <span class="NDLSystemFont">PreInit</span> called,
        as would be the case in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Init</span> function of the
        receiving service.</li>

    <li>Actor Add and Removed messages are now sent using <span class="NDLSystemFont"
        >SendLocal</span> instead of <span class="NDLSystemFont">SendImmediate</span>. This is to
        comply with best practices and avoid ambiguity in the message ordering. Actor Added messages
        will now always come after Scene Graph Added messages for the actor's scene graph, and Actor
        Removed will follow Scene Graph Removed.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_camera_svc.htm">Camera Service</a></h4>

<ul>
    <li>A method has been added to the Camera Service to enable an existing scene graph camera
        to be added to the set tracked by the service. This enables a camera that is present in
        a loaded scene graph to be used with the service. Previously, only entity-based
        cameras were available.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_render_svc.htm">Render Service</a></h4>

<ul>
    <li>The following functions of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/ecr/ecr__RenderService.htm">ecr::RenderService</a></span> and
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/ecr/ecr__RenderContext.htm">
    ecr::RenderContext</a></span> classes were changed to deal with entity pointers instead of
    entity IDs: <span class="NDLSystemFont">AddRenderedEntity</span> and
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">RemoveRenderedEntity</span>.</li>
    
    <li>Two new callback functions were added to <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/ecr/ecr__IRenderServiceDelegate.htm">ecr::IRenderServiceDelegate</a>
    </span>: <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnRenderedEntityAdded</span> and
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnRenderedEntityRemoved</span>.
    These functions are called on delegates when an entity scene graph is added or removed from
    the render service.  This allows other services that deal with rendered objects to be informed
    when rendered objects appear or disappear from the world.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_light_svc.htm">Light Service</a></h4>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/ecr/ecr__LightService.htm">
    ecr::LightService</a></span> has been modified to support entities entering and exiting the
    world.  The implementation takes advantage of the new callback functions in the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">IRenderServiceDelegate</span> class rather than using the scene
    graph added and scene graph removed messages.  Thus, the functionality of the previous
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">HandleSceneGraphAddedMessage</span> and
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">HandleSceneGraphRemovedMessage</span> have been moved to the new
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnRenderedEntityAdded</span> and
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnRenderedEntityRemoved</span> functions.</li>
</ul>

<h4>PhysX</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
        "../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_scene_svc.htm">PhysX Scene Service</a></span>
        has been refactored to use a
        <a href="../../Reference/egfPhysX/egfPhysX__PhysXSceneModel.htm">built-in model</a>
        for the <a href=
        "../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/PhysXModelLibrary__PhysXScene.htm">PhysXScene</a> model.
        As part of this work, some of the APIs for accessing scenes in the PhysX Scene Service have
        changed, and the timing of messages has also been affected. Most importantly, most methods
        to access scenes by entity ID have been removed. Get the scene name from the entity and use
        that to find it in the PhysX Scene Service. Internally, the built-in model now handles most
        aspects of scene management while the service handles messaging and external access to the
        scenes.</li>
        
    <li>Several system services have been removed and their functionality replaced by Frame Events.
        The <span class="NDLSystemFont">egfPhysX::StartSimulationService</span> and
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">egfPhysX::FinishSimulationService</span> classes have been
        replaced by frame events, named <span class="NDLSystemFont">SceneService!Simulate</span>
        and <span class="NDLSystemFont">SceneService!FetchResults</span>, managed by the
        <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
        "../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_scene_svc.htm">PhysX Scene Service</a></span>.
        The <span class="NDLSystemFont">ecrPhysX::UpdateDestinationsService</span> and
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">ecrPhysX::UpdateSourcesService</span> classes have been
        replaced by frame events, named <span class="NDLSystemFont">PropService!UpdateDestinations</span>
        and <span class="NDLSystemFont">PropService!UpdateSources</span>, managed by the
        <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
        "../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_prop_svc.htm">PhysX Prop Service</a></span>.
        See the <a href="../../Convert/Previous/Converting_to_Gamebryo_3_2_Overview.htm">
        Gamebryo 3.2 Conversion Guide</a> for information on modifying an application to accommodate
        this change.
    </li>

    <li>Message sending from the <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_prop_svc.htm">
        PhysX Prop Service</a> has been changed. Previously, messages were sent as raw
        <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/efd/efd__StreamMessage.htm">efd::StreamMessage</a></span>
        objects that needed to be unpacked by the application. Now, there is a specific message
        class for <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/ecrPhysX/ecrPhysX__NiPhysXSceneAdded.htm">
        NiPhysXSceneAdded</a></span> messages. There is a generic message class,
        <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/ecrPhysX/ecrPhysX__PhysXPropMessage.htm">
        PhysXPropMessage</a></span> that is wrapped to provide the
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">PhysXPropAddedToScene</span> and
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">PhysXPropRemovingFromScene</span> messages. Services that
        receive any of these messages must be updated to handle the new types.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="../../Reference/eon/eon__ReplicationService.htm">Replication Service</a></h4>
<ul>
    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/eon/eon__IReplicationGroupPolicy.htm">
    eon::IReplicationGroupPolicy</a></span> has been refactored to give custom implementations much
    greater power. Previously the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ReplicationService</span> did most of
    the work while <span class="NDLSystemFont">IReplicationGroupPolicy</span> mearly provided
    configuration settings. Now the <span class="NDLSystemFont">IReplicationGroupPolicy</span> does
    the majority of the work which can allow custom implimentations to completely replace or highly
    optimize the message passing used during replication.</li>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1.1</h3>

<h4><a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_animation_svc.htm">Animation Service</a></h4>

<ul>
    <li>A bug that resulting in incorrect accumulation settings on Actor-based entities has been
        fixed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>PhysX</h4>

<ul>
    <li>PhysX-based particle systems may now be used with the Game Framework provided the PhysXScene
        entity that is controlling simulation has the BlockOnFetch property true.</li>
        
    <li>A bug in the
        <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_trigger_svc.htm">
        Trigger Service</a> that caused memory corruption when an entity or scene was removed
        has been fixed. Memory holding issues in this class have also been fixed.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">AddEntityActor</span> and
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">RemoveEntityActor</span> methods in the
        <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_trigger_svc.htm">
        Trigger Service</a> have been changed. Trigger Service ownership of the entity's actor
        is now set when the entity is added. If owned, the Trigger Service will release
        the entity's actor when the entity is removed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Toolbench</h4>
<ul>
    <li>World Builder can now be used to create whiteboxes. See <a href="..\..\Tools\WorldBuilder\wb_entity_whiteboxing.htm">Working with Whiteboxes</a> for more information
        on authoring whiteboxes and <a href="..\..\Programmer\CoreRuntimeServices\core_services_egmWhitebox.htm">The egmWhitebox Library</a> for
        runtime service information.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1</h3>

<h4>Asset Loading</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Most of the asset types supported by Gamebryo are now background loaded by default. This
    has a significant impact on applications. See the <a href=
    "../../Convert/Previous/Converting_to_Gamebryo_3_1_Overview.htm">Conversion Guide</a> for
    details.</li>

    <li>The entity asset preloading system has been substantially changed. See the description of
    the new <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Preloadable.htm">Preloadable</a></span>
    model and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/egf/egf__EntityManager.htm">egf::EntityManager</a></span> for more details.
    <em>All flat models will need to be re-exported</em>.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">egf::EntityManager::RegisterRequiredAssetPreload</span> and
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">BehaviorAPI::PreloadRequiredAssetByProperty</span> functions have
    been removed as part of the new entity preloading system.</li>

    <li>The egf::FlatModelManager::FindOrLoadModel function is now deprecated. Use <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/egf/egf__FlatModelManager.htm#classegf_1_1_flat_model_manager_1021ebae92d387c74e82adcf46726e8e6">
    egf::FlatModelManager::PreloadModel</a></span> if you need to load flat models dynamically at
    runtime.</li>

    <li>The <a href=
    "../../Reference/egf/egf__EntityLoaderService.htm">egf::EntityLoaderService</a>, the <a href=
    "../../Reference/ecr/ecr__SceneGraphService.htm">ecr::SceneGraphService</a>, and the <a href=
    "../../Reference/egmAnimation/egmAnimation__AnimationService.htm">egmAnimation::AnimationService</a>
    are now all dependent on the AssetFactoryManager and will fail to initialize of the
    AssetFactoryManager is not available.</li>

    <li>The <a href="../../Reference/egf/egf__FlatModelManager.htm">egf::FlatModelManager</a> no
    longer pre-caches the location of flat model files during initialization. Flat models are
    loaded when loading world files or creating new entities at runtime. They can also be preloaded
    programatically. See <a href=
    "../../Convert/Previous/convert_background_asset_load_3_1.htm">Converting to background Asset
    Loading</a> for further details.</li>

    <li>The <a href="../../Reference/egfLua/egf__SchedulerLua.htm">egfLua::SchedulerLua</a> class
    no longer pre-caches the location of all Lua behavior scripts during initialization. Lua
    scripts are loaded when loading flat model files or creating new entities at runtime. They can
    also be preloaded programmatically. See <a href=
    "../../Convert/Previous/convert_background_asset_load_3_1.htm">Converting to background Asset
    Loading</a> for further details.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Scripting and Lua</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The bindings in bapiLua::LuaTraits have been improved to provide additional type safety.
    Previously crashes could result from passing incompatible data to a built-in API method but now
    these cases should simply generate a Lua error with a descriptive error string.</li>

    <li>The third parameter to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">EE_SWIG_LUA_TYPE_WRAP</span> macro
    has been removed. This macro was used in Swig .i files for Lua. Instead a new method named
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">IsType</span> has been added to all <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">bapiLua::LuaTraits</span> specializations. This method allows greater control
    over what Lua objects can be converted to what C++ data types.</li>

    <li>The Lua implementations of BehaviorAPI.GetProperty and BehaviorAPI.SetProperty can now be
    extended to support custom property types by implementing instances of the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/egfLua/egf__ILuaPropertyHandler.htm">egf::ILuaPropertyHandler</a></span> class
    and registering them with <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/egfLua/egf__SchedulerLua.htm#classegf_1_1_scheduler_lua_1e69622b36874d9f7c3aaf61b304985a6">
    egf::SchedulerLua::RegisterPropertyHandler</a></span>. This is demonstrated in the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Programmer/Entity_Properties/entity_property_adding.htm">CustomTypeExample2</a></span>
    sample.</li>

    <li>Fixed a bug in the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Programmer/Scripting/lua_lib_ecr.htm#ClosestObjectOnRay">ecr.ClosestObjectOnRay</a></span>
    built-in API function where the Entity ID returned was always invalid.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Input Service</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_input_svc.htm">Input Service</a></span> now
    supports binding of input actions directly to entity behaviors. The action map callbacks for
    both behavior or message callbacks can now be configured at run time. In addition the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/ecrInput/ecrInput__InputHandler.htm">InputHandler</a></span> built-in model
    can be used to provide a data driven binding between the behaviors on an entity and actions
    which allows for full rapid iteration of action handling. This new functionality deprecates the
    "<span class="NDLSystemFont">EventCategory</span>" attribute on the "<span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Event</span>" tag in .actionmap files. See <a href=
    "../../Programmer/CoreRuntimeServices/core_services_ecrInput.htm">The ecrInput Library</a>
    documentation for details.</li>

    <li>Added support for mice in Action Maps via <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ActionClsID="MOUSE"</span>, implemented in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/ecrInput/ecrInput__InputServiceMouse.htm">ecrInput::InputServiceMouse</a></span>.</li>

    <li>Modified the <a href="../../Reference/ecrInput/ecrInput__InputService.htm">Input
    Service</a> to load action maps in the background. This also added a new message type,
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/ecrInput/ecrInput__InputActionMapsLoaded.htm">ecrInput::InputActionMapsLoaded</a></span>
    that is sent when an action map has completed loading or failed to load. Samples that use
    action maps were also updated.</li>

    <li>The <a href="../../Reference/ecrInput/ecrInput__InputService.htm">Input Service</a> now
    supports the specification of an action map in the config files, through <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Config/config_qckref.htm#InputService">InputService.ActionMapURN</a></span>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Light Service</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The following additions have been made to the StandardModelLibrary in regards to lighting:
        <ul>
            <li>Added a Lightable model, which specifies the maximum number of lights by type an
                entity can support. Defaults to a maximum of 3 point, 2 spot, and 3 directional
                lights.</li>
            <li>Added a UpdateLightingOnMove property to the Light model. When this is set to false
                (default), adjusting any of the light's properties will not force lighting to be
                recomputed for all entities.</li>
            <li>Added a LightPriority property to the Light model. The Light Service now computes
                the 'influence' of a light on an entity, which takes its priority into account. When
                choosing which lights will affect an entity, lights with the greatest influence win.
                </li>
            <li>Added support for explicit Always Affected/Never Affected lists to the Light model.
                This allows you to manually override lighting.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Added a tool version of the Light service that always acts as if the UpdateLightingOnMove 
    property is set to TRUE.</li>

    <li>The Light Service will now only consider light entities that mix-in the Lightable model 
    for lighting. The StandardModelLibrary has been updated so that the Actor, Mesh, and Terrain
    models now mix-in the Lightable model. Applications will need to update their local copy of 
    the StandardModelLibrary with the shipped StandardModelLibrary. If you do not make this update,
    the Light Service will ignore all entities, and nothing will be affected by lights.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Scene Graph Service</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The behavior of the Scene Graph Service has been clarified in cases where a NIF file is
    loaded without a valid top level <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span>. Such cases
    arise due to file load errors or the use of a texture NIF for a scene graph. An
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/ecr/ecr__SceneGraphAddedMessage.htm">
    ecr::SceneGraphAddedMessage.htm</a></span> message is only sent when the scene graph
    has valid top level objects. Internally, asset data is held for the asset but no objects are
    present in the data. If the empty scene graph was loaded in response to an property
    change or asset change, and an existing scene graph is already in use, that existing scene
    graph will be removed and a corresponding message sent. If an asset cannot be located at
    all (no file name is available) the asset will be totally removed from the system and can
    only be reinstated with a game restart or reset. The same rules apply to scene graphs used
    for attachments.
    </li>

    <li>Preloading of scene graphs now includes preloading of any scene graph attachments.
    </li>
    
    <li>An asset locate is no longer performed when an asset that was cached using a multi-file
    urn is subsequenly requested alone. This reduces the delay in creating an entity with a
    scene graph, assuming the scene graph has been pre-cached and the cache operation has
    completed.
    </li>
    
    <li>The functions <span class="NDLSystemFont">ecr::SceneGraphService::ReloadAsset(const
    efd::utf8string&amp;, efd::DataStream*)</span> and <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ecr::SceneGraphService::CreateSceneGraphURN(const efd::utf8string&amp;, const
    efd::Bool, const efd::Bool)</span> have been removed.</li>
    
    <li>A parameter, <span class="NDLSystemFont">delayRender</span>, has been added to several
    public API functions that create scene graphs in order to support entity creation but not
    display. An additional function, <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ecr::SceneGraphService::DisplayEntity</span>, has been added to cause delayed
    render objects to be displayed. It must be explicitly invoked when delayed render is
    requested.</li>

    <li>A new function, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/ecr/ecr__SceneGraphService.htm#classecr_1_1_scene_graph_service_1a816f578cdbe8766f627d33df404b9ff">
    ecr::SceneGraphService::GetAttachedSceneGraph</a></span>, has been added to enable access to an
    attached scene graph.</li>

    <li>Fixed a bug in SceneGraphService where loading PhysX content in a non-PhysX based
    application caused a crash during cloning. This was likely to occur when adding MangledMetal
    assets into a non-PhysX application such as HelloWorld.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Animation Service</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Actors that are preloaded or cached in <span class="NDLSystemFont">AnimationService</span>
    now respect the accumulation property of the entity.</li>

    <li>Under some circumstances the scene graph for an animated entity could be displayed before
    the entity discovery message was received and data was updated. This issue has been fixed so
    that objects only appear upon entity discovery and their parameters are correctly set before
    display.</li>

    <li>An asset locate is no longer performed when an asset that was cached using a multi-file
    urn is subsequenly requested alone. This reduces the delay in creating an entity with an
    animated scene graph, assuming that KFM has been pre-cached and the cache operation has
    completed.
    </li>

    <li>The previously public strings, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/egmAnimation/egmAnimation__AnimationService.htm">egmAnimation::AnimationService</a>::kAnimationTag</span>
    and <span class="NDLSystemFont">kAnimationKFTag</span> are now protected.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/egmAnimation/egmAnimation__AnimationService.htm#classegm_animation_1_1_animation_service_1aa097d58a6bc9b06067f2e7e00da38a1">
    egmAnimation::AnimationService::GetAnimationIdFromName</a></span> method now returns
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager::INVALID_SEQUENCE_ID</span> when an unrecognized
    sequence is specified instead of 0 which is a valid sequence id.</li>
</ul>

<h4>PhysX</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_prop_svc.htm">PhysX Prop Service</a></span> will
    now try to add a new prop to the PhysX scene as soon as the prop is discovered instead of
    waiting until the Prop Service's OnTick method. If the scene is in simulation when the prop is
    discovered, then it will be added to the scene during the OnTick method as it did
    previously.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_prop_svc.htm">PhysX Prop Service</a></span>
    now modifies the name of each collision mesh in a given prop by prepending the file path
    to the mesh name. This significantly reduces the chances of mesh naming conflicts between
    props from different files.
    </li>

    <li>Fixed a bug in the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_physx_terrain_svc.htm">PhysX Terrain
    Service</a></span> that prevented RTTI from working correctly. The PhysX Terrain Service was
    improperly registering itself using the Terrain Service class ID.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Miscellaneous Changes</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Rapid iteration for built-in model property default values (in other words, changes to
    built-in model properties made in the Entity Modeling Tool) has been implemented. Rapid
    iteration of built-in model properties in a block file worked previously and continues to work
    the same. Rapid iteration of built-in model properties should now work exactly like normal
    properties.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_visual_tracker_svc.htm">Visual Tracker
    Service</a></span> now supports multiple pages of trackers and has scatter graph support. The
    scatter graph support is used to provide a page that displays a top-down view of the currently
    created entities. Pages can be cycled through by triggering a "<span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">VISUAL_TRACKER_ACTION</span>" action in the InputService.</li>

    <li>Convenience functions that allocate and register common sets of system services have been
    added to simplify application startup code. These are useful when the default settings are
    correct for your application. See <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Namespaces/efd.htm">efd::CreateFoundationServices</a></span>,
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Namespaces/egf.htm">egf::CreateGameServices</a></span>,

    and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/Namespaces/eon.htm">eon::CreateOnlineServices</a></span>
    for details about which services are allocated by which methods.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_render_svc.htm">ecr::RenderService</a></span> now
    has a configuration parameter, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Config/config_qckref.htm#RenderService">RenderService.ShaderCachePath</a></span>,
    for setting the shader cache path and no longer takes this path as a constructor
    parameter.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_rapid_iteration_svc.htm">Rapid Iteration System
    Service</a></span> now creates its owning <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">efd::MessageService</span> for communication with Toolbench.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/egf/egf__NotificationService.htm">Notification Service</a></span> no longer
    takes a <span class="NDLSystemFont">propertyGroup</span> parameter in any of its methods. This
    parameter previously did not function correctly and only the value zero reliably worked.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/egf/egf__IBuiltinModelImpl.htm">egf::IBuiltinModelImpl</a></span> class is no
    longer a templated class; see the <a href=
    "../../Convert/Previous/Converting_to_Gamebryo_3_1_Overview.htm#IBuiltinModelImpl">conversion
    guide</a> for details. In addition this class now supports associative array style property
    bindings. See the <a href="../../Reference/Macros/efd_macros_builtin_model.htm">Built-in Model
    Macros</a> documentation for details.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/egf/egf__EntityLoaderService.htm#classegf_1_1_entity_loader_service_1026614d0db717cabfd09da00da31e6a2">
    egf::EntityLoaderService::RequestEntitySetUnload</a></span> method now supports both urn and
    logical IDs to identify the world file to unload. This fixes a bug in LightSpeed 3.0 where one
    could load a world file with either a urn or a logical Asset ID but could only unload that
    world using the logical Asset ID. For example, if you used 'urn:emergent-world-file:world' to
    load your world, you can now use this same urn to unload it.</li>

    <li>Several new functions have been added to <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/efd/efd__MessageService.htm#categorization_functions">efd::MessageService</a></span>
    for simplifying generation of public, private and unique Categories.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Tools/DataDrivenEnum/DataDrivenEnum_usage.htm">DDE Header Generator</a></span> now
    supports the "Bitfield" type which will automatically assign enum values to bits of an unsigned
    integer type. Those enum value can also be combined with the bitwise or (|) operator in data
    driven enum files.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1 Specific Notes</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/egf/egf__FlatModelManager.htm">efd::FlatModelManager::FindOrLoadModel</a></span>
    function no longer loads flat model files that are not already loaded if using the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">efd::AssetFactoryManager</span>. If this function is required by your
    application, you can work around this problem by using the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">FlatModelManager::PreloadModel</span> function to ensure the model is available
    at runtime.</li>

    <li>Care should be taken when using the Standard Model Library <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Preloadable.htm">Preloadable</a></span>
    module to preload entity assets. These assets are loaded based on properties found in the
    entity model when the entity is created. Because these assets are loaded asynchronously, it is
    possible to change these properties in the time between the start of the asset preload request
    and the completion of the preload operation. If your application changes entity assets at
    runtime, you should validate that the assets associated with your entities match the asset
    property values. If there is a mismatch, you should ensure the assets are reloaded using the
    updated property values. You cannot assume assets loaded during preload match the current asset
    property values if these properties change at runtime.</li>
    
    <li>When script encryption is enabled for the PS3, the presence of an unencrypted script can cause
    an assert instead of a general failure to load the asset.  Under no circumstances will the unencrypted
    script be loaded, but it's presence in the asset web will cause the library to assume that it's available
    until it actually attempts to load and fails due to the lack of encryption.  To avoid this issue,
    make sure that scripts are encrypted during deployment when encryption is enabled.</li>
</ul>

<h3>All Gamebryo LightSpeed Releases</h3>

<h4>Asset Runtime Services</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The Asset Controller automatically scans directories in your <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root Directory&gt;</em></span> for new assets. For
    efficiency, it only scans the directories that have timestamps that are newer than the last
    scan time. If you use file system archiving, revision control, or mirroring software that
    modifies directory timestamps, new changes may be undetected by the Asset Controller. The
    workaround is to cause a full scan by deleting the file <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-metadata/awebckpt.nt</span>
    and then running the Asset Controller.</li>

    <li>New projects inherit the default asset tagging policies, which include the use of
    non-persistent logical asset IDs. This has the advantage of not requiring you to check-in and
    share source metadata files among developers. The disadvantage is that you will not be able to
    re-arrange your assets into a new directory structure without also updating all of the logical
    asset ID references in your game content (block and model files). The other alternative is to
    enable persistent logical IDs by setting <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">LogicalIdTagger.PersistentIds=True</span> in the file <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root
    Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-config/LogicalIdTagger.ini</span></li>

    <li>Using multiple classification tags (for example, combining a platform classification with a
    locale specification such as "urn:D3D10:French") in the 'GlobalTagSpace' parameter for the
    AssetLocatorService constructor will return non-deterministic asset lookup results for some use
    cases. Selection via multiple classifications should be avoided until this is corrected.
    Selection with a single classification tag (for example, use just a locale specification such
    as "urn:French") produces the expected results.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Entity, Property and Behavior</h4>
<ul>
    <li>A block file cannot remove individual entries from map or list style properties that are
    specified in the model file, it can only override existing entries or add new entries. Specific
    map or list entries can be removed at runtime if needed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Input Service</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When an <span class="NDLSystemFont">ACTION_COMBO</span> event times-out partway through,
    the actions that have activated to progress the combo to its current point are reprocessed and
    messages are sent for them in cases where they appear in other events. For example, say one
    event is the combo actions Start-Select and another event is the action Start. When the user
    presses Start, the combo will begin waiting for the Select to fire. Depending on the time-out,
    it may wait several frames before deciding that no Select is ever coming. The Start message is
    then sent in response to the Start only event. The delayed messages that are sent in this
    situation have invalid magnitude and coordinate data, and may not reflect the current state of
    the activating button. In general, the handling of combo events that time-out is poorly defined
    and we recommend avoiding events that are sub-sets of other events, and certainly do not rely
    on the state stored in messages that result from combo time-outs.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lua Scripting</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Immediate behaviors that are called from C++ using <span class=
        "NDLSystemFont">Entity::CallImmediate</span> or from script via <span class=
        "NDLSystemFont">BehaviorAPI.CallBehavior</span> cannot be debugged using the Lua Behavior
        Debugger.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">table.foreach()</span> Lua method is deprecated in Lua 5.1
        and should not be used. This method is not compatible with coroutines and can result in a
        crash if used. Instead use the <span class="NDLSystemFont">pairs</span> or <span
        class="NDLSystemFont">ipairs</span> method with a <span class="NDLSystemFont">for</span>
        loop.</li>
</ul>

<a name="PhysX_Framework_Known_Issues" id="PhysX_Framework_Known_Issues"></a>
<h4>PhysX</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When a scene graph (NIF file) is attached to another using entity properties, its
    physics properties are not recognised by the PhysX services. For example, an axe with a
    physics rigid body associated with it will not be instantiated into the physics scene
    when the axe is attached to a character's hand. A custom service is required to work
    around this problem, or modifications or sub-classing of the PhysXProp service to handle
    scene graph attachment messages.
    </li>
    
    <li>The origin of PhysX trigger shapes (cubes, cylinders, and capsules) is at the center of
    their lower face, while the origin of the standard visualizers in World Builder is at the
    center of their volume. This leads to PhysX instantiating shapes significantly above where they
    are displayed in World Builder if Entities mixing in PhysXShape are set to use the Cube
    visualizer. The PhysXModelLibrary uses the correct PhysXBox visualizers, but MangledMetal does
    not.</li>

    <li>OnPhysXTrigger callbacks are only supported for rigid bodies.</li>

    <li>If you change the scale of an entity in response to the OnEnter event of a trigger
    it will immediately generate another OnEnter event for the trigger. This can lead to
    expensive cyclical behavior invocation.
    </li>
    
    <li>The activation or deactivation of a physical sequence (rag-doll) from script may sometimes
    happen within a PhysX simulate/fetchResult block, which produces error messages and prevents
    the transition to/from rag-doll from occurring. Setting the BlockOnFetch property of the
    <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/PhysXModelLibrary__PhysXScene.htm">PhysXScene</a>
    entity model may help reduce the frequency with which this problem occurs.
    </li>
    
    <li>Static props from the Maya export pipeline may cause runtime warning messages from
    PhysX.</li>

    <li>Props that use assets containing PhysX-based particle systems require the BlockOnFetch
    property of the controlling PhysXScene entity to true.</li>

    <li>The PropService has C++ built-ins to control PhysX debug rendering, but there are no Lua
    bindings to allow script to access them. Using NVIDIA's Visual Remote Debugger often provides
    better debugging support.</li>

    <li>Runtime state of PhysX scenes is not maintained across renaming during rapid iteration. A
    PhysXScene entity that is simulating when its SceneName property is changed will stop
    simulating. You will need to have a script call bapiPhysXBase.StartSimulating(), or reload your
    game, to resume physics.</li>
	
    <li>A bug in the
        <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_trigger_svc.htm">
        Trigger Service</a> allows you to set the size property for a PhysX trigger box to negative values.
		This creates an inverted trigger volume that never generates trigger reports yet generates correct
		debug geometry. This results in what appears to be correct PhysX volumes not triggering when
		expected.  To avoid this issue, ensure all of your PhysX trigger volumes are specified using 
		positive numbers only.</li>
		
	
</ul>

<h4>Rapid Iteration</h4>
<ul>
    <li>If a game uses the Rapid Iteration service (egf::RapidIterationService) and attempts to
    read from a different asset web root than the Asset Controller is servicing, then all asset
    requests will fail once the connection to Asset Controller is made. This can be be a problem if
    a Game Solution is opened in Toolbench, and a game is subsequently run that points to a
    different asset web root, as Toolbench will modify the asset web root serviced by Asset
    Controller to the asset web root indicated by the GSL.</li>

    <li>Composition changes that are made to a model in EMT require a game reset. A composition
    change is any change that modifies the mix-ins that are used by the model. Entities that are
    based on models whose composition is changed will be removed from the simulation, but will
    return when you perform a Game Reset from Toolbench.</li>

    <li>Rapid iteration of entity properties directly in World Builder causes the affected entities
    to reset to those new property values. Any in-game property updates that occurred since the
    start of the application are over-written.</li>

    <li>Rapid iteration cannot remove individual entries from map or list style properties, it can
    only add new entries. Default values can be removed from the model file during rapid iteration
    but this may not effect the runtime property if the property has has been modified by any block
    file or runtime change.</li>

    <li>Setting up to perform Rapid Iteration is fairly simple, but there are subtle differences
    between the platforms. See the <a href="../../Tutorials/Rapid_Iteration/rapid_intro.htm">Rapid
    Iteration</a> documentation for more information.</li>

    <li>Rapid iteration on the name of a PhysXScene entity may require the game to be restarted for
    simulation to be correct.</li>

    <li>Rapid iteration on an actor with PhysX props may cause the actor to be incorrectly
    animated. You can work around this issue by resetting the game.</li>

    <li>Changes to the material masks in Scene Designer are not properly updated when viewing the
    terrain on a console or remote PC. This is due to the fact that only the material xml file is
    changing and getting uploaded. The mask files are not uploaded correctly. When working with a
    local file system, changes are properly reflected.</li>

    <li>Rapid iteration in World Builder on entities that mix in a built-in model will result in
    all properties from the built-in model being changed to their flat model default value, even if
    that matches their current value. Further, any built-in model properties that are overridden in
    the block file will be changed twice on a rapid iteration, once to their default and then again
    to the override value.</li>

    <li>In some situations, entity links can break during rapid iteration. For example, this occurs
    when the target entity of a link was deleted at run-time and then the block is rapidly iterated
    but the source entity was not modified. The reload re-creates the deleted entity but does not
    update the linked property on the source entity because that entity was not modified.</li>

    <li>During a Toolbench world reset, all existing entities are destroyed and recreated, however
    the existing entities are destroyed immediately and by-pass the normal OnDestroy
    lifecycle.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Scene Graph Service</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The NIF attachment mechanism will apply both parent and child scale during attachment. This
    means that if an object with an attachment point had Scale=2 and the object to be attached had
    Scale=3, then the effective scale of the attached object will be 6. This can be worked around
    by authoring art with a uniform scale (typical assets having Scale=1) or by applying the
    inverse of the parent scale when an object is attached.</li>
</ul>

<h4>SWIG</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Various projects use <a href="http://www.swig.org/" target="_blank">SWIG</a> to generate
    script binding code for built-in API methods. The build commands used to run SWIG do not have
    proper dependency checking. As a result, when changing header files that are included in a SWIG
    .i file, it may be necessary to manually rebuild the .i files. When adding .i files to your own
    projects, we recommend that dependencies be manually specified.</li>
</ul>

  <h4>
    Terrain</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Currently, most functionality within the terrain service does not support multiple
      terrains being loaded simultaneously. For this reason, it is not recommended to
      have two terrains loaded at the same time as doing so may cause unexpected issues.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>
    Environment
  </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A specific time of day file must be defined for each entity.</li>
  </ul>
