<h1>Undo/Redo system</h1>

<p>One of the services Toolbench provides to plug-in authors is
an undo/redo framework for content. The UI exposing this
functionality lives in the core Toolbench assembly
Emergent.Toolbench.Undo.dll, but its underpinnings are in the
action system implemented in Emergent.Toolbench.Actions.dll.</p>

<h2>Supporting Undo</h2>

<p>The Toolbench action system breaks functionality down into
specific tasks that can be tracked for features like undo/redo
and automation, including macro record/playback, scripting, and
automated functional testing. Actions are commands that can be
presented to the user in menus or toolbar buttons. They can also
be assigned shortcut keys.</p>

<table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
    <tr align="left">
        <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD">
            <p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>

            <div class="NDLNote">
                Actions do not <b>always</b> represent commands
                performed via menus or toolbars. In some cases
                actions are wrappers around arbitrary code such
                as property changes to certain classes.
            </div>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Actions are the preferred way to expose functionality from a
plug-in. Other plug-ins that may build on your plug-in can use
these actions to execute features in a way recognized by the
content system, ensuring that undo/redo functions as expected.
Executing operations directly sidesteps the action system and
potentially corrupts content system features.</p>

<p>All actions must implement the IActionHandler interface, which
includes the method Execute. Actions that modify content should
implement the IUndoableActionHandler, which inherits from
IActionHandler and adds Undo and Redo methods, plus a Description
field. The Description is used when the action history is
displayed.</p>

<p>All content is given an associated history aspect which
implements the IActionHistoryAspect interface. This aspect stores
a list of all undoable actions that have been performed on the
content. The undo/redo UI queries this aspect for information
about the undo stack and tells it when to undo and redo stored
actions.</p>

<p>Be sure that performing undo and redo on your action actually
recreates the original result of the operation. For example,
consider an action that creates a new object with a generated ID.
Undoing this action would remove the created object. Redoing the
action should recreate the object with the same ID. This
may mean storing additional data in the action.</p>

<p>Sometimes actions will trigger the execution of additional
actions. This cascade of operations is rolled up by the action
system and presented as a single user-initiated event for UI
purposes. Although this bundling happens automatically, action
implementers do need to be aware that the action system will not
attempt to unwind a cascade of executed actions in case of action
failure. For actions that kick off chains of actions the best
practice is to do thorough validation before allowing the initial
action to proceed.</p>
