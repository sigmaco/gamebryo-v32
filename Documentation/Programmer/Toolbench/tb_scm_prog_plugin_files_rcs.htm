<h1>Placing Toolbench Plug-in Files Under Revision Control</h1>

<p>This guide will explain how plug-in authors can make their plug-ins Revision Control aware
by using the IRevisionService from the Emergent.Toolbench.RevisionControl plug-in.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>Before doing any operations you'll first need a reference to the revision service.</p>
<pre>IRevisionService rcs = Platform.GetService&lt;IRevisionService&gt;();</pre>

<p>The commands that your plug-in will be responsible for executing are Edit/Delete/Rename.  The
reason Add is not in that list is that typically you'll just call Edit.  Add is a subset of Edit
in the revision service, so there's usually never a reason to explicitly call Add.</p>

<pre>rcs.Edit(@"c:\A.txt");</pre>
<pre>rcs.Delete(@"c:\A.txt");</pre>
<pre>rcs.Rename(@"c:\A.txt", @"c:\B.txt");</pre>

<p>The revision service layer will take care of things like asking if read-only files need to
be overwritten.  It's important to remember that the actual operation will happen at some point 
after the last transaction is closed.  However, it is important that you do things like call Edit
before you do any file IO so that we can do things like blow off read-only locks.  It's also
recommended that your plug-in uses both the FileTransaction and DirtyFileWriter classes that are
part of the Toolbench kernel.</p>

<p>It's very important that you do not mix System.IO.File commands and IRevisionService commands.
We execute all RevisionService commands on a separate thread.  So the commands are
non-deterministic but are guaranteed to occur unless cancelled or aborted by the user.  If that 
happens then the associated file IO actions will not occur.  However by convention if there is an 
error executing a command we still perform that commands file operation.</p>

<h2>Transactions</h2>

<p>If your plug-in needs to perform many revision control commands in a group, you'll need to 
wrap those commands in a transaction.  Transactions can have any number of sub/child transactions
and they can be aborted individually without aborting all other transactions.  By default when
saving we automatically open a single transaction at the beginning.  If you're performing more than
a single operation outside of a save, you'll need to open a transaction before any commands are 
executed.  This is because if no transactions have been opened when a command is executed, we 
automatically create a transaction containing a single command.  So executing two commands back to 
back with no transaction to group them would cause the revision control wait dialog to be 
triggered.</p>

<p>To start a transaction:</p>
<pre>rcs.StartTransaction();</pre>

<p>To end a transaction:</p>
<pre>rcs.EndTransaction();</pre>

<p>If during your transaction an exception is thrown or you find you need to abort the 
transaction, just use:</p>
<pre>rcs.AbortTransaction();</pre>
