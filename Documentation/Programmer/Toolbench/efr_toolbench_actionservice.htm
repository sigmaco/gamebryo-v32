<h1>Action Overview</h1>

<p>The action system in Toolbench provides plug-in writers with a
mechanism for creating operations other plug-ins can use. By
creating an action you can make an operation undoable,
automateable and potentially scriptable.</p>

<h2>Action Executor</h2>

<p>The ActionExecutor is responsible for executing actions in
Toolbench. Any action it executes is forwarded to any action
processors registered with the action system, provided the action
executor has not been suspended. Currently if a plug-in has an
action processor it will be loaded immediately with the action
plug-in and begin receiving any actions that are executed.</p>

<h2>Action Processor</h2>

<p>The IActionProcessor interface is used by plug-in authors to
create their action processors that the action executor will send
actions to.  Action processors are a way plug-in authors can add
functionality to the action system.  For example, the undo system
is implemented in part with an action processor.  The undo action
processor sniffs incoming actions to figure out if it should
place them onto the undo stack.</p>

<h2>Interfaces</h2>

<ul>
    <li>IActionHandler

        <ul>
            <li>All actions must implement this interface at some
            level.  Actions only implementing this interface can
            only do the bare minimum, which is execute.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>IContentModifyingAction

        <ul>
            <li>Actions with this interface will cause the
            content to be dirtied automatically if an action of
            this type is executed on the content.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>IUndoableActionHandler

        <ul>
            <li>Actions with this interface can be undone or
            redone once executed.  Undoable actions are also
            content modifying actions. Note, it is the
            responsibility of the action to maintain the
            necessary state necessary for performing a redo.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>ISerializableAction

        <ul>
            <li>Actions with this interface support being
            serialized and deserialized at a later time to
            perform the exact same action again.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>All 3 special IActionHandler interfaces have support for
dynamically changing the assumed capability of the interface. 
For example, the IUndoableActionHandler has a property that
returns whether or not the action is undoable.  This is so the
system supports a situation where the action could become
conditionally undoable, most of the time the properties will just
return true.</p>

<p>An action that does not always return true for its undo
capability is the entity select actions in the World Builder
plug-in suite. There is a setting to enable or disable the
ability for selection events/actions to be undoable. Therefore,
the selection related actions check this setting in order to
determine the state of the undoable nature of the action.</p>
