<h1>ActionSet (Extension-Point)</h1>

<h3>Emergent.Toolbench.Workbench.ActionSet</h3>

<p>This extension point allows developers to create menus,
toolbar items and actions all in a data-driven manner. By
expressing all of the information needed to create the menus and
toolbar items here, there is no reason to load the assembly to
display any of these items.</p>
