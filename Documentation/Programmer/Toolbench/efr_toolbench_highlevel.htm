<h1>Toolbench High-Level Overview</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Toolbench has a delay-loaded plug-in based architecture, very
similar to the design strategy of Eclipse
(http://www.eclipse.org). So where possible we do not load
assemblies and plug-ins until it becomes absolutely necessary.
Toolbench is also very Service Architecture oriented and several
plug-ins take advantage of this to expose their functionality
through services other plug-ins can consume.</p>

<h2>Boot Loaders</h2>

<p>There are two boot loaders that come with Toolbench; one for
launching Toolbench in Windowed mode and another for Console
mode. These boot loaders exist so that the core of Toolbench can
be separated from the way Toolbench will be used.</p>

<h2>Core Plug-ins</h2>

<p>The core of Toolbench is Platform and if a plug-in developer
needs to interact with anything in the core of Toolbench they
will go through Platform almost exclusively. The Platform can be
thought of as the Toolbench kernel. Some notable things the
Platform exposes for plug-in writers are a registry of all
plug-ins; a method of accessing resources contained in plug-in
satellite assemblies without loading the main plug-in; plug-in
activation; service management; and notifications.</p>

<p>When a boot loader is started it initializes the Platform
which then proceeds to load plug-in manifests, start essential
services and launch the user&rsquo;s runnable plug-in. Note, boot
loaders are "runnable" plug-ins.</p>

<h2>Plug-in Composition</h2>

<p>A plug-in is composed of generally two parts; the "plugin.xml"
manifest file and the .Net Assembly containing the compiled code
and resources for the plug-in. However, the only truly required
thing a plug-in must have is the manifest file. This primarily
has been done because so much of Toolbench is driven by just data
that sometimes no code is ever required to enhance a part of
Toolbench.</p>

<a name="PluginManifest" id=
"PluginManifest"></a><h2>Plug-in Registry</h2>

<p>On startup Toolbench will scan its plug-in directory for any
manifest files it can find. The PluginRegistry is responsible for
this scanning process and maintains a PluginDescriptor for any
plug-in it finds during this process. The PluginDescriptor stores
all the information about a plug-in that was contained in the
plug-in manifest.</p>

<p>The scanning and loading process happens in several steps.
First all the manifest files are loaded into XML DOM objects and
validated against a schema to ensure the document is formatted
correctly. Then for each manifest we parse the plug-in's
definition, dependencies, assembly file name, localization
information and finally the extension points which will be
explained later.</p>

<p>This information is stored in the plug-in's PluginDescriptor
which is then stored in the PluginRegistry. Now that the
PluginRegistry has a valid definition for every known plug-in as
well as every extension point, it proceeds to parse plug-in
extensions in each manifest. Each extension is validated against
a separate schema specified by the corresponding extension point
and if the extension is valid it is stored. If the validation
fails there is a detailed error message that is logged containing
the XML of the extension that failed parsing and a message
why.</p>

<p>Finally several debug only validation steps occur, these are
compiled out of the application in release mode.</p>

<p>The first validation step checks to make sure that plug-ins do
not contain local copies of other plug-in's assemblies in their
plug-in directory. This is to prevent loading multiple
assemblies of the same plug-in as well as prevent build issues
that can crop up from one plug-in copying resources to another
plug-in's directory, possibly stomping data.</p>

<p>The second validation step exists to make certain that each
plug-in lists every other plug-in it depends on in the dependency
section of its plug-in manifest. Note: This is a recursive
process, so if every plug-in you depend on is depended on by
another plug-in your plug-in depends on, your plug-in can depend
on just that one plug-in. That way the assemblies a plug-in
depends on in code are always loaded into the application domain
before your plug-in.</p>

<p>For this to occur, every plug-in assembly is loaded in a
reflection-only context; a light-weight, but not ideal option for
standard operation. Each reflection loaded assembly is then
scanned for any assembly it depends on. This list is then matched
against all known assemblies registered with other plug-ins to
see if there are any assemblies a plug-in depends on that have a
corresponding plug-in that is not recursively traceable in the
plug-in&rsquo;s dependencies.</p>

<p>This is all to make sure that Toolbench could never get into a
state where under certain conditions startup order of plug-ins
could potentially crash Toolbench.</p>

<h2>Extensions and Extension Points</h2>

<p>To facilitate extending Toolbench we have integrated the
concept of Extensions and Extension Points into Toolbench.
Plug-ins use these to extend other plug-ins as well as offer ways
for other plug-in writers to extend their plug-in. Extensions and
Extension Points define a contract of sorts between one plug-in
and another plug-in. This contract is completely unique to a
given plug-in in that there are no strict interfaces that all
plug-ins must adhere to.</p>

<p>Extension Points are added by plug-in writers to their
manifests to inform other authors that by extending this
extension point they can add some new functionality to their
plug-in. When specifying your extension point authors can
optionally provide an XML schema to validate the extension that
implements the extension point so that they don't have
write a lot of error checking code. Any extension failing the
schema of an extension point will not show up as parsed data for
a plug-in to read.</p>

<p>Extensions are the implementation of Extension Points and
plug-in writers will add them to their manifests when they need
to add some new functionality.</p>

<p>When placing your extension points in your plug-in it is a
recommended pattern that you define an internal class that acts
as a container for all your extension point identifiers.</p>

<pre>
internal class ExtensionPoints
{
    public const String MyExtPoint = "Company.Toolbench.Sample.MyExtPoint";
}
</pre>

<p>If possible, you will want to make sure that your extension
points allow users to include multiple extensions inside the
extension definition. This is to minimize the amount of XML
plug-in writers will need to write and ensures related items in a
plug-in manifest stick together.</p>

<pre>
&lt;extension point="Company.Toolbench.Sample.MyExtPoint"&gt;
    &lt;myext id="MyExt.Sample.1" name-key="Extension1"/&gt;
    &lt;myext id="MyExt.Sample.2" name-key="Extension2"/&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;
</pre>

<p>Usually extension points are consumed by services; generally
these services are started in your Plug-in Entry Point. Then when
the service is initialized you will want to scan the extension
points you care about, loading any extensions that exist for it.
Here is some sample code for reading the sample extension
provided above, with and without LINQ.</p>

<p>With LINQ:</p>

<pre>
var myExts =
    // All the extensions using this extension point
    from extension in Platform.GetExtensions(ExtensionPoints.MyExtPoint)
    // The node representing the root of the extension
    from myExtData in extension.ConfigurationData
    // Create an object representing the extension
    select new MyExt(myExtData);

// Create a dictionary of the extensions based on their Id
m_myExts = myExts.ToDictionary(myExt =&gt; myExt.Id);   
</pre>

<p>Without LINQ:</p>

<pre>
foreach(IExtension extension in Platform.GetExtensions(ExtensionPoints.MyExtPoint))
{
    foreach(IElementData myExtData in extension.ConfigurationData)
    {
        MyExt myExt = new MyExt(myExtData);
        m_myExts.Add(myExt.Id, myExt);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Services are certainly not the only method by which extension
implementations can be consumed. For example, consider a
PaintBrush style application. The core plug-ins for such an
application may define an extension point for brushes and an
extension point for effect generators. Out of the box, our
PaintBrush application has a plug-in containing extensions for
the brushes and effects it stores by default. However, due to the
nature of extension points, it is trivial for additional plug-in
authors to add their own custom brushes.</p>

<p>When designing extension points there are a few common
practices that plug-in authors should keep in mind. Some of these
are mentioned previously:</p>

<ul>
    <li>File paths for things like icons should always be
    relative to the plug-in directory of the plug-in that is
    defining the extension. To get the directory for a plug-in,
    on any IElementData you can call
    myElementData.PluginDescriptor.InstallPath to get the plug-in
    directory where this IElementData was found.</li>

    <li>Where possible always accept multiple extensions to be
    defined in the same extension definition, like in the above
    example.</li>

    <li>Use the XML schemas.  They will save you a lot of hassle
    dealing with improperly defined extensions and, for the
    fragments of XML your extension is concerned with, the
    schemas are usually very small.</li>

    <li>Allow extensions to be aggregated together. For example,
    assume one plug-in defines a toolbar with toolbar items in it
    and gives the toolbar a unique identifier. If another plug-in
    defines a new toolbar with the same unique identifier,
    combine the toolbar items defined in that toolbar item with
    the items defined in the first plug-in. Sometimes it doesn't
    make sense and in those cases log warnings or errors, but
    where possible permit this kind of aggregation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extension Registry</h2>

<p>Platform provides some convenience methods for accessing
extensions as you saw in the last example. However, if you want
more information about the existing extensions and extension
points you will want to check out the ExtensionRegistry. It holds
all the data relating to extensions and their points that were
located in the plug-in manifests. To access the ExtensionRegistry
just use the static property: <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Platform.ExtensionRegistry</span></p>

<h2>Plug-in Activator<br></h2>

<p>The PluginActivator's primary responsibilities are
loading plug-ins and creating objects through reflection. The
activator initializes plug-ins and watches the .Net Application
Domain for assembly loads so that it can maintain a mapping of
namespaces to assemblies. It does this to ensure it can quickly
locate the correct Type object matching a full class name that a
plug-in might need to create an instance based on data contained
in an extension.</p>

<h2>Services<br></h2>

<p>Many Toolbench plug-ins register services with the system to
expose shared functionality to other plug-in writers. There are
convenience methods on Platform for getting or adding
services.<br></p>

<p>To create a service your class will need to implement the
IService interface. To add the service to Toolbench you will want
to call:<br></p>

<pre>
Platform.AddService(new MyService(), typeof(IMyService));
</pre>

<p>It is highly recommended that your service class is marked as
internal and that you provide an interface specifically for your
service that a user of the service will use when calling:</p>

<pre>
IMyService myService = Platform.GetService&lt;IMyService&gt;();
</pre>

<h2>Logging</h2>

<p>The logging system in Toolbench works through the Extension
Point system. The Logger scans plug-ins for the extension point
"Emergent.Toolbench.LogTarget". This extension point allows the
logger to send any log message to an external log target. Log
targets could be files, a UI, or even a network stream. When a
message is sent to the logger, it is forwarded to all known log
targets.</p>

<p>Some logging examples in Toolbench:</p>

<pre>
Logger.Error("My Error Message");
</pre>

<h2>Notifications</h2>

<p>We encourage plug-in authors to provide events in their
classes for other plug-ins to attach to, but this isn't an option
for a plug-in that hasn't loaded yet.  So Toolbench offers a
basic notification system for very high-level simple events. To
handle this scenario the NotificationRegistry tracks extensions
to the "Emergent.Toolbench.NotificationHandler" extension
point.</p>

<p>The NotificationHandler extension point allows your plug-in to
setup a handler to a particular notification, with the option to
load the plug-in or not when the notification occurs. All
notification handler classes must implement the
INotificationHandler interface.  To facilitate a basic level of
filtering, notification handlers can have a param attribute
specified in their extension. This attribute will prevent the
handler from being called if the param string does not match one
provided by the caller of Platform.Notify.  If a notification
handler does not specify a param attribute, or leaves the
attribute empty, the notification will be considered callable
whenever the notification occurs, provided the plug-in is loaded
or will be if it specifies that it should be.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Toolbench.PluginLoading (param="plug-in id")

        <ul>
            <li>This notification occurs whenever a plug-in
            begins loading, and will pass the plug-in id of the
            plug-in loading.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Toolbench.PluginLoaded (param="plug-in id")

        <ul>
            <li>This notification occurs once a plug-in is
            successfully loaded, and will pass the plug-in id of
            the plug-in that loaded.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To define a notification handler:</p>

<pre>
&lt;extension point="Emergent.Toolbench.NotificationHandler"&gt;
    &lt;handler id="Toolbench.PluginLoading"
             class="Emergent.Toolbench.MyPlugin.NotificationAlert"
             param="Emergent.Toolbench.OtherPlugin"
             load-plugin="true" /&gt;

&lt;/extension&gt;
</pre>

<p>Example notification handler:</p>

<pre>
public class NotificationAlert : INotificationHandler
{
    #region INotificationHandler Members

    public class NotificationAlert : INotificationHandler
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Loading: " + e.Parameter);
    }

    #endregion
}
</pre>

<p>To perform a notification:</p>

<pre>
Platform.Notify("Unique.Notification.Id");
</pre>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>Because .Net already offers such a good localization system
through their satellite assembly approach we chose to design
resource gathering in Toolbench around this method. By adding
some extra metadata to the plug-in manifest, a plug-in writer can
tell Toolbench how to access their satellite assemblies. With
this information other plug-in writers can design their extension
points around the idea that the data for the extension may
actually be located in one of that plug-in's satellite
assemblies.</p>

<p>Note that this release of Toolbench has not been fully
internationalized. This section serves the purpose of
demonstrating how Toolbench is expected to be internationalized
and to allow plug-in authors to prepare by placing things like
literal strings into resource pages.</p>

<p>For a plug-in to be recognized as having satellite assemblies
the plug-in will need to have the following element in its
plug-in manifest.</p>

<pre>
&lt;localization fallback-culture="en-US" resource-base="Emergent.I18nSample.Properties.Resources"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>So in addition to a "name" attribute on an extension point
there might be a "name-key" attribute which the extension point
consumer could use to load a localized name for the extension
point based on the data in a satellite assembly and the currently
active culture.</p>

<p>To access the resources of a plug-in, developers will access
Platform.Resources; it handles resource caching and resource
fallback. So in case the current culture has no equivalent
satellite assembly or resource it will fallback to the parent
culture's resources until there are no more parent cultures. When
this occurs it will use the ultimate fallback culture specified
in that bit of metadata provided in the plug-in manifest.</p>

<p>For future internationalization purposes, it is a recommended
pattern that as a plug-in author one always provides a "Name" and
"Name-Key" pair in extension points in case the consumer of the
extension point does not want to create satellite assemblies for
their resources and instead just wants to inline the data into
their plug-in manifest because they may not have a need to
localize any of their data.</p>

<p>The following is a sample of how resources can be accessed in
another plug-in:</p>

<pre>
foreach(IExtension extension in Platform.GetExtensions(ExtensionPoints.MyExtPoint))
{
    foreach(IElementData myExtData in extension.ConfigurationData)
    {
        String extName = Platform.Resources.GetString(
            myExtData.PluginDescriptor, myExtData.GetAttribute("name-key"));
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Startup Process</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A boot loader is started which starts the Platform
    running.</li>

    <li>Platform initializes members and creates any directories
    for things like settings. It also registers some extension
    points through code (ex. LogTarget) because Toolbench core
    does not have a corresponding manifest.</li>

    <li>The plug-in registry is then built. While building the
    plug-in registry, the extension registry is also built with
    any extensions or extension points that were found.</li>

    <li>Based on a local settings file in the execution directory
    or by command line arguments a runnable extension is chosen
    to be started.</li>

    <li>The runnable extension's corresponding class that
    implements the IRunnable interface is instantiated and is
    run.</li>

    <li>From here a plug-in like Workbench would start the
    Application loop and return when the main window was
    closed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Plug-in Entry Point</h2><a name="PluginEntryPoint" id=
"PluginEntryPoint"></a>

<p>When writing a plug-in the author can <b>optionally</b>
specify a class at the top of their plug-in manifest. This class
must be derived from the PluginBase class. This class will be
instantiated when the plug-in is loaded and is effectively the
plug-in's entry point. There are overridable methods for
starting and stopping the plug-in that allow you to do things
like start and stop services or perform any other similar actions
that should be performed on startup of your plug-in.</p>

<p>Our recommended pattern for plug-in entry points is:</p>

<pre>
    
    public class Plugin : PluginBase
    {
        private static IPluginResources m_resources;
        private static IPluginDescriptor m_descriptor;

        public override void Start()
        {
            m_descriptor = Descriptor;
            m_resources = Resources;
        }

        public static IPluginDescriptor StaticDescriptor
        {
            get { return m_descriptor; }
        }

        public static IPluginResources StaticResources
        {
            get { return m_resources; }
        }
    }    
</pre>

<p>By following this pattern, you provide yourself with
convenience accessors for both your plug-in's descriptor as
well as any available resources in a satellite assembly that you
may want to bind to in the UI.</p>
