<h1>Particle System Simulator</h1>

<p>All simulation of particles in a particle system is 
 performed by an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSSimulator.htm">NiPSSimulator</a></span> 
 object that is attached to the main <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSParticleSystem.htm">NiPSParticleSystem</a></span> 
 object. Simulation of particles includes updating particle positions based 
 on velocity, applying forces to particles, simulating collisions between 
 particles and a collider object, and killing off particles whose ages 
 have exceeded their life spans. An <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSSimulator</span> 
 object is required by <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span>. 
 The particle system will not function properly without a simulator attached.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSSimulator</span> is derived 
 from <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshModifier.htm">NiMeshModifier</a></span> 
 and takes advantage of <a href="../NiFloodgate/Introduction_to_NiFloodgate.htm">Floodgate</a> 
 to execute its simulation tasks. Rather than performing all of the simulation 
 work itself, however, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSSimulator</span> holds 
 a set of <a href="Particle_System_Simulator_Steps.htm">simulator steps</a>, 
 each of which performs some aspect of the simulation. Each step provides 
 a Floodgate kernel and its required input and output streams. In its <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> function, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSSimulator</span> 
 queries each simulation step for its kernel and streams and performs a 
 remapping operation to ensure that the steps are ordered appropriately 
 by Floodgate during execution. Each input stream for a step is replaced 
 by the output stream from a previous step, if that output stream refers 
 to the same particle data as the input stream. This ensures that steps 
 that occur earlier in the simulator's set of steps will have their output 
 used as input to the next step. Floodgate uses this information to schedule 
 the previous step in a prior stage from the subsequent step. If two steps 
 do not modify and use the same data streams, they can be run concurrently. 
 Because the simulator performs this remapping operation itself, each simulator 
 step does not need to know about any other step.</p>

<p>The final simulator step is treated slightly differently. 
 The last step in the simulator's set of steps is always ensured to run 
 in a later stage from all other steps. This is because work may need to 
 get done in the final step that must be done last. This ordering is ensured 
 by the use of a dummy Floodgate stream that is set as an output for all 
 other steps and an input for the last step.</p>

<p>The Floodgate task submitted by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSSimulator</span> 
 object operates directly on the particle data contained in <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span>. 
 As such, that data must not be accessed by any other code while the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSSimulator</span> task is running. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem::ForceSimulationToComplete</span> 
 function can be called to ensure that the simulator has completed and 
 that it is safe to access the particle data.</p>
