<a name="Creating_a_Particle_System"></a><h2>Creating a Particle 
 System</h2>

<p>To create a particle system, use the static <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSParticleSystem.htm">NiPSParticleSystem</a>::Create</span> 
 function. This function will create a simulator and all the necessary 
 steps for it, along with optionally creating and adding an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSBoundUpdater.htm">NiPSBoundUpdater</a></span> 
 object (for computing a dynamic bounding volume). It also provides an 
 option to create a default generator. Modifications can be made to the 
 particle system after this function has been called.</p>

<a name="Particle_Data"></a><h2>Particle Data</h2>

<p>The per-particle data necessary to properly simulate 
 the particle system is stored in aligned arrays in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSParticleSystem.htm">NiPSParticleSystem</a></span>. 
 This data includes positions, colors, velocities, radii, and other parameters 
 for the particles. A maximum number of particles is passed into the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> constructor that is used 
 to set the size for the data arrays. It cannot be changed at any time 
 after the particle system has been created, and thus the particle data 
 arrays are never reallocated after creation. This number should represent 
 the maximum number of particles that will ever exist in the system. If 
 the system attempts to emit new particles after the maximum number of 
 particles has been reached, no additional particles are created. In addition 
 to this maximum number, the particle system also keeps track of the number 
 of active particles. This number should be used as an upper limit when 
 indexing into particle data arrays.</p>

<p>The particle data arrays are owned by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> 
 object and are not protected against concurrent access with locking structures 
 due to performance implications. Since <a href="../NiFloodgate/Introduction_to_NiFloodgate.htm">Floodgate</a> 
 kernels could be running on other cores simultaneously with application 
 code, it is possible that an application could attempt to access the particle 
 data at the same time as a particle system simulator or generator. Because 
 of this, it is required that applications call the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ForceSimulationToComplete</span> 
 function to ensure that it is safe to access the particle data before 
 doing anything with it. The particle system internally ensures that its 
 Floodgate kernels are not improperly accessing the data.</p>

<a name="Simulator_and_Generator"></a><h2>Simulator and Generator</h2>

<p>Because <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> 
 is derived from <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span>, it can have <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshModifier.htm">NiMeshModifier</a></span> 
 objects attached to it. In particular, it must have an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSSimulator.htm">NiPSSimulator</a></span> 
 object attached. This mesh modifier performs all the simulation work for 
 the particle system, resulting in updated particle data arrays that can 
 be consumed by a particle generator mesh modifier. The generator uses 
 the particle data to generate and update renderable geometry for the particles. 
 The standard generator that ships with Gamebryo is <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSFacingQuadGenerator.htm">NiPSFacingQuadGenerator</a></span>.</p>

<p>During its update, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> 
 will kick off its simulator to perform the simulation of the system. It 
 will then return, allowing the simulator to execute asynchronously during 
 the remainder of the scene graph update. If the particle system is determined 
 to be visible by a culling operation, the simulator is forced to complete 
 at that point. If the particle system is not drawn, the simulator is completed 
 on the next update. After the simulator has completed, the particle system 
 object does some work to remove particles that have died and to spawn 
 new particles prior to rendering. Particles that have been added to the 
 system during simulation are not actually added until the beginning of 
 the subsequent update. Once these operations are complete, a generator 
 is kicked off to generate the renderable geometry for the particles. This 
 geometry is stored as data streams on the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> 
 object itself. The generator is allowed to execute asynchronously until 
 immediately before the particle system object is rendered.</p>

<a name="Resetting_the_System"></a><h2>Resetting the System</h2>

<p>If the time passed into the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem::Update</span> 
 function is less than the last time that was passed in, this condition 
 is detected and all particles are removed from the system. The same functionality 
 can be obtained manually by calling the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ResetParticleSystem</span> 
 function. An <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSResetOnLoopCtlr.htm">NiPSResetOnLoopCtlr</a></span> 
 time controller object can be attached to the particle system to cause 
 it to remove all of its particles automatically when it loops.</p>

<a name="World_Space_Particles_vs__Model_Space_Particles"></a><h2>World-Space 
 Particles vs. Model-Space Particles</h2>

<p>By default, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> 
 computes and stores the particles in world space. This means that the 
 translation and rotation of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> 
 object do not have any effect on the positions or velocities of the particles, 
 allowing it to reside anywhere in the scene graph. There is an option 
 to store particles in model space, if desired. In this case, moving the 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> object has the effect 
 of moving the entire cloud of active particles with it. This may be desirable 
 in certain situations. For example, if you have a character inside a train 
 holding a smoking cigarette. Because it is inside the train, the entire 
 cloud of cigarette smoke would appear to move with the train to an observer 
 standing on the ground outside, but it would not move with the tip of 
 the cigarette relative to the train. The vast majority of situations will 
 call for world-space particles, but the option for model-space particles 
 is available, if needed.</p>

<p><b>NOTE</b>
: When <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> is set to use world-space 
 particles, its world scale still has an effect on the positions of the 
 particles. Thus, just because the system is set to "world-space" 
 does not mean that the positions of the particles as stored in their particle 
 data array do not need to be multiplied by the world transform of the 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> object. It does mean, 
 however, that the world translate and the world rotate on that object 
 will always be the identity. The world scale is preserved to allow the 
 size and position of each particle to scale appropriately when the entire 
 system is scaled. When the world scale is changed for a world-space particle 
 system, an inverse scale is applied to all currently active particles 
 to ensure that they do not change position. All newly emitted particles 
 will observe the new scale.</p>

<p><b><a name="StaticBoundNote"></a>ALSO 
 NOTE</b>
: When a world-space particle system has a static bounding 
 volume (i.e., does not have an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSBoundUpdater.htm">NiPSBoundUpdater</a></span> 
 attached to it), its bounding volume will be transformed by the original 
 world transform (before its translate and rotate are cleared), causing 
 the bounding volume to move with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> 
 object when it is transformed. If this was not done, the bounding volume 
 would always remain in the same location, regardless of where the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> object was moved. This may 
 be okay in certain circumstances, but it is not intuitive behavior for 
 a static bounding volume, especially if the particle emitter is moved 
 along with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> object. 
 If the bounding volume is dynamic, it will be properly computed in world 
 space each frame by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSBoundUpdater</span> 
 and will not move with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> 
 object.</p>

<a name="Emitters_and_Spawners"></a><h2>Emitters and Spawners</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> 
 owns a set of <a href="Particle_System_Emitters_and_Spawners.htm#Particle_Emitters">emitters</a> 
 and a set of <a href="Particle_System_Emitters_and_Spawners.htm#Particle_Spawners">spawners</a>. 
 The emitters are used to specify initial parameters for particles that 
 are added to the system. The spawners are used to spawn new particles 
 from existing particles when they die or collide with colliders. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> also references a death 
 spawner. The presence of this spawner determines whether or not new particles 
 should get spawned when particles are killed. If this pointer is NULL, 
 no spawning on death will occur. The death spawner does not have to point 
 to a spawner that is owned by the same particle system. A spawner owned 
 by a different particle system can be used to spawn entirely different 
 particles when particles die.</p>

<a name="Mesh_Particles"></a><h2>Mesh Particles</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span> 
 represents a set of particles whose geometry is created by a generator 
 mesh modifier and stored on that object in data streams. Some particle 
 systems, however, require particles to be instances of a complex mesh 
 or a scene graph. Such a system uses an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSMeshParticleSystem.htm">NiPSMeshParticleSystem</a></span> 
 object instead. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSMeshParticleSystem</span> 
 internally stores a container <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiNode.htm">NiNode</a></span> 
 object whose children are the mesh particles in the system. Mesh particles 
 can be any <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a></span>, 
 including an entire scene graph, and may optionally contain animations 
 and time controllers (or even particle systems) themselves. Care must 
 be taken when using mesh particles, however, to ensure that performance 
 does not suffer too badly. By definition, each mesh particle constitutes 
 at least one draw call, and an entire scene graph of objects may be several 
 draw calls per particle. Ideally, a mesh particle should be just a single 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> object rather than an entire scene 
 graph. When the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSMeshParticleSystem</span> 
 object is updated, it iterates through all the mesh particles, calling 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> on each one, passing in the particle's 
 age as the time. This allows mesh particles to internally animate independently 
 from each other.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSMeshParticleSystem</span> 
 holds pools of mesh particles that can be reused after they die, thereby 
 reducing the overhead of cloning and deleting particles. These pools can 
 be pre-filled when loading a NIF file to eliminate the performance hit 
 of allocating the pools when the first particle dies. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSMeshParticleSystem</span> 
 also stores an array of master particles. When a new mesh particle is 
 added, the appropriate master particle is cloned and added to the container 
 node. Multiple master particles may be stored to support spawning a different 
 mesh type upon particle death or collision with a particle collider. The 
 number of master particles must match the number of generations for the 
 particle system (the number of times that collision or death will spawn 
 new particles). Thus, multiple types of mesh particles can exist in the 
 particle system at the same time.</p>

<p>Because mesh particles are stored as scene graph children 
 of a container node, the renderable geometry for these particles does 
 not reside in data streams on the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSMeshParticleSystem</span> 
 object. As such, an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSMeshParticleSystem</span> 
 object will not have a generator mesh modifier attached and will automatically 
 exclude itself from rendering. Instead, it will render its container node 
 of mesh particles.</p>

<a name="Running_Up_a_Particle_System"></a><h2>Running Up a 
 Particle System</h2>

<p>When particle systems are exported from the art packages 
 and are saved to disk, the number of active particles is not saved out. 
 In fact, none of the per-particle data is saved to disk for a particle 
 system. A particle system is inherently a simulation, and saving out its 
 full state at any given moment would be wasteful and unnecessary in the 
 vast majority of cases. Thus, if particles should already exist when the 
 first frame is rendered, the particle system needs to be "run up". 
 This involves determining the minimum time at which particles should start 
 getting emitted and updating the particle system from that time until 
 the time of the first rendered frame at some fixed interval.</p>

<p>A function exists in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSParticleSystem.htm">NiPSParticleSystem</a></span> 
 that will return the time it takes to run up a given particle system. This function, NiPSParticleSystem<span class="NDLSystemFont">::GetRunUpTime()</span> 
 can be useful when running up particle systems because it provides the 
 minimum time at which particles should be emitted. Particle emitters can 
 have a negative start time specified for them in Max and Maya. This results 
 in animation keys on the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSEmitParticlesCtlr.htm">NiPSEmitParticlesCtlr</a></span> 
 with negative time values. These negative values, in combination with 
 running up the particle system, can be used to ensure that some particles 
 already exist at time 0.0 when the application begins.</p>
