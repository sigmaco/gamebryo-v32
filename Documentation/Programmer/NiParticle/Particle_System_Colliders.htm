<h1>Particle System Colliders</h1>

<p>The Gamebryo particle system allows for collider objects 
 to be specified that can deflect particles and cause them to die and/or 
 spawn new particles on collision. The simulation of these colliders is 
 implemented by the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSSimulatorCollidersStep.htm">NiPSSimulatorCollidersStep</a></span> 
 simulator step. This step holds a set of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSCollider.htm">NiPSCollider</a></span> 
 objects, each of which represents a single collider object. Colliders 
 are applied in the order in which they appear in this set.</p>

<p>A particle collider modifies the velocity and position 
 of particles that it detects to have collided with it. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSCollider</span> 
 object holds data members that define the collider object and provide 
 some behavior options, such as how much bounce should be applied upon 
 collision or whether or not the particle should die or spawn more particles 
 when it collides. It also provides a block of data to the simulator step 
 that holds all the information necessary to detect and handle collisions 
 with the collider. The data blocks from all the colliders are combined 
 into a large buffer by the step and are sent to its <a href="../NiFloodgate/Introduction_to_NiFloodgate.htm">Floodgate</a> 
 kernel.</p>

<p>Upon execution, the kernel creates a list of data blocks 
 for the potential colliders. It iterates through the list, passing each 
 data block to a helper function defined in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSColliderHelpers.htm">NiPSColliderHelpers</a></span> 
 that detects a collision between each particle and the collider. The collider 
 that reports the closest collision for each particle will have its handler 
 function in <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSColliderHelpers</span> called 
 to actually update the position and velocity of that particle, and then 
 be removed from the list of collider. The process is then repeated with 
 the remaining colliders, until there are no more colliders or no collision 
 is found. The result is that each particle has one opportunity to collide 
 with each collider on each frame, which correctly handles particles bouncing 
 into corners.</p>

<p>The code relating to a particular particle collider 
 resides in several locations. First, a structure containing the necessary 
 data for the collider is defined in the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSColliderDefinitions.htm">NiPSColliderDefinitions</a></span> 
 class. This is defined separately from the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSCollider</span> 
 class because it must be included and used by the Floodgate kernel, which 
 may have different compiler requirements depending on the platform. An 
 enumerated type is also defined in <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSColliderDefinitions</span> 
 corresponding to the collider. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSCollider</span> 
 object holds an instance of its data structure as a member variable and 
 provides accessors for changing the collider parameters. The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSSimulatorCollidersKernel.htm">NiPSSimulatorCollidersKernel</a></span> 
 Floodgate kernel must know about the collider in order to properly parse 
 its data block from the larger buffer, and corresponding functions must 
 exist in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSColliderHelpers.htm">NiPSColliderHelpers</a></span> 
 to actually detect and handle the collision. Adding a new type of collider 
 to the system requires making changes in all of these locations if that 
 collider is to be executed as part of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSSimulatorCollidersStep</span> 
 simulator step. Alternatively, a new simulator step could be created that 
 implements the new collider separately.</p>

<p>A <a href="Particle_System_Emitters_and_Spawners.htm#Particle_Spawners">particle 
 spawner</a> can be associated with each particle collider, if desired, 
 to support spawning new particles when a particle collides with that collider. 
 This spawner does not have to belong to the same particle system that 
 the collider is a part of. This allows particles with vastly different 
 characteristics to be spawned from any collider.</p>
