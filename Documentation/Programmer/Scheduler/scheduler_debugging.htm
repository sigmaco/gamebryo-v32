<h1>Debugging the Scheduler</h1>

<p>Most of the Scheduler debugging problems you might face will be related to invoking the behaviors that your application depends upon. Entities that are created by the game will interact by sending events, which are often intended to invoke other behaviors. This is a very dynamic system, and there is potential to have unresolved behavior invocations that manifest as run-time errors.</p>

<p>To track down these kinds of errors, you will likely depend on entries in your application's log file that are created by the Scheduler. These messages will have the module value of either "Scheduler" or "Entity," which will allow you to filter the logs to just these messages. Below is a list of some common errors you might encounter.</p>

<ol>
<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">Behavior id=&lt;XXXX&gt; not contained in flat model '&lt;FlatModelName&gt;' for this entity</span><br>
Occurs when an entity is trying to call a behavior that does not exist for another entity because the other entity's model does not include the behavior.
</li>
<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">The entity &lt;EntityId&gt; does not mix-in the proper model &lt;MixinModelName&gt; to be allowed to execute the requested behavior &lt;BehaviorName&gt;.</span><br>
Occurs when an entity is trying to call a behavior that does not exist for another entity because the other entity lacks a mix-in model that includes this behavior.
</li>
<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">Unable to initialize scripting for &lt;ScriptEngineName&gt;</span><br>
Occurs when the Scheduler cannot load the needed libraries to initialize a scripting engine. If this failure occurs, you will receive additional errors later when the Scheduler attempts to invoke the behaviors that need this scripting engine. These errors will be similar to: <span class="NDLSystemFont">Scripting Runtime &lt;ScriptEngineId&gt; not found, skipped behavior.</span>
</li>
<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">DestroyEntity() - Specified Entity &lt;EntityId&gt; not owned by scheduler.</span><br>
Occurs when another Entity or a System Service tries to destroy an Entity that is not owned by the Scheduler. The Scheduler cannot destroy an entity that is owned by another Scheduler. This may only be accomplished through passing an event to the Entity that would cause it to be destroyed in the context of its own Scheduler.
</li>
</ol>
