<h1>Introduction to the NiMaterial System</h1>

<p>The Gamebryo material system is a mechanism for an application to serve up
<a href="../NiShader/Introduction_to_Gamebryo_s_Shader_System.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span></a> instances based off of the state of the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span> object being rendered.
Application developers often need to apply a similar effect to a variety of
objects, and a single <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> isn't
sufficient to describe all the rendering conditions that it needs to handle.
Rather than force an artist to apply a slightly different <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> to each geometry object, a single <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMaterial</span> can be used that will provide an appropriate
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> object at runtime for each object
that's drawn.</p>

<p>A simple material can look at a mesh and determine if it was skinned or
unskinned. It could then select between skinned and unskinned instances of the
shader that it loaded from a shader library. Other more complicated materials
are also possible, such as systems that actually generate vertex and pixel
shader program code on the fly. This sort of shader program code generation can
be done either additively or subtractively. An additive system takes a variety
of high-level shader language program fragments and stitches them together to
make a complete shader program. A subtractive system will have an entire shader
program and removes pieces from it using compile-time preprocessor
commands.</p>

<h2>NiMaterial vs NiShader</h2>

<p>It is important to understand the distinction that Gamebryo makes between an
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMaterial</span> and an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span>. An <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span>
contains the entire render state for how a specific geometry object will be
drawn. It can span multiple render passes if necessary, but it is intended to
describe to the renderer how to draw a certain object in a certain set of
circumstances. A single <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> instance
can be shared among multiple geometry objects, if their structure and rendering
circumstances coincide, but for the most part, an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> should not be able to easily handle different
situations. For example, a single <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span>
may be able to draw an unskinned object that has a base map and a dark map. If
the same <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> object is applied to a
geometry that is missing a dark map, or is skinned, then the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> may fail. That is expected, because that
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> was not written to be able to
handle those circumstances.</p>

<p>In this role, an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> is very well
described by an <a href="../NiShader/Introduction_to_NSF_NSB_Shaders.htm">NSF
shader</a> or <a href="../NiShader/Introduction_!FX_Shaders.htm">FX shader</a>.
These shaders can be used to create a variety of effects, but they can only
effectively be used in specific circumstances, when the expected textures and
vertex data are present and when only a certain number of lights will be used,
for example.</p>

<p>An <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMaterial</span>, on the other hand, is
responsible for deciding which <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span>
should be used in a given circumstance, even possibly going so far as to create
an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> if none exist. An <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMaterial</span> can examine an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> object and its properties to make the decision,
but it can also consider other parameters, such as the capabilities of the
hardware, a user-supplied setting, or anything else.</p>

<p>One way to think about it is that an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMaterial</span> describes a given visual effect, while an
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> is one implementation of that
effect. A single <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMaterial</span> can actually
describe an entire family of effects, if the material writer wants.</p>

<p>Note that there are instances of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span>-derived classes in Gamebryo that do
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMaterial</span>-level work and are capable of
handling different rendering situations. This behavior is left over from
earlier versions of Gamebryo that lacked the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMaterial</span> system. For backwards compatibility, these
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> classes were left intact, but the
preferred behavior for <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> classes is
as described here, with <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMaterial</span> objects
handling any necessary decision-making.</p>

system in detail, as well as the integration into the renderer. To really
understand the way the system works, these sections are a must read.</p>
