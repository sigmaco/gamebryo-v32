<h1>NiFragmentMaterial</h1>

<p>This class is designed to be the base class for an additive
shader fragment system. The general idea behind an additive
shader system is that a programmer will write several HLSL or Cg
functions whose inputs and outputs can be connected together to
define a complete shader program. The connected graph that is
formed from the links between program fragments is called a
<a href=
"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=808602&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;coll=GUIDE"
target="_blank">shade tree</a>.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFragmentMaterial</span>
encapsulates Gamebryo's implementation of a shade-tree framework.
The pipeline for generating a compiled shader is as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Generate the descriptor for the geometry object. This
    will produce an <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiMaterialDescriptor</span> object, which is
    a 128-bit bitfield that encodes all relevant information
    about the state of the object as it pertains to generating
    its shade-tree. This process is encapsulated in the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">GenerateDescriptor</span> method.
    A common checklist of items that can be examined would be:

        <ul>
            <li>Is the object skinned?</li>

            <li>What per-vertex data exists on the object?</li>

            <li>Is the object lit? How many lights are affecting
            it? What types of lights are affecting it?</li>

            <li>What textures are applied to the object? What UV
            sets do they use?</li>

            <li>Are there tangent-space bases per-vertex?</li>

            <li>Is the object affected by specularity?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Search through the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> cache to determine if this
    material configuration has been encountered before. This is
    usually one of the first things done in the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">GenerateShader</span> method. If this
    material configuration has been encountered before, simply
    re-use the previously generated shader.</li>

    <li>Search through the list of failed shaders to see if this
    material configuration is even possible for the current
    hardware. If the shader failed previously, return NULL and
    the renderer will use its internal error shader.</li>

    <li>Break the material descriptor into one or more sets of
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiGPUProgramDescriptors</span>.
    These classes are 128-bit bitfields that encapsulate all that
    needs to be done to generate the correct <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiGPUProgram</span> for a given pass in this
    material configuration. The decomposition of material
    descriptor to program descriptors is performed in the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">GenerateShaderDescArray</span>
    method.</li>

    <li>Create the appropriate <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> derived class for the current
    renderer.</li>

    <li>Determine the packing requirements for that shader.</li>

    <li>For each set of <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiGPUProgramDescriptors</span> in this
    material instance, generate a rendering pass object.

        <ol>
            <li>Determine how this pass will blend with the
            previous pass (<span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">SetAlphaOverride</span> method)</li>

            <li>Generate the GPU programs for the pass
            (<span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">GenerateShaderPrograms</span>
            method). See <a href=
            "NiFragmentMaterial.htm#Creating_the_Shade_Tree">Creating
            the Shade Tree</a> for more information.

                <ol>
                    <li>Generate the vertex program (<span class=
                    "NDLSystemFont">GenerateVertexShaderProgram</span>
                    method)</li>

                    <li>Generate the pixel program (<span class=
                    "NDLSystemFont">GeneratePixelShaderProgram</span>
                    method)</li>

                    <li>For each program generated, create an
                    <span class=
                    "NDLSystemFont">NiShaderConstantMap</span>
                    and add all uniform variables to it
                    (<span class=
                    "NDLSystemFont">AddResourceToShaderConstantMap</span>
                    method).</li>

                    <li>If an error occurred, return the
                    appropriate error code.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>If successful in the previous steps, initialize the new
    shader and return. Otherwise, call an appropriate fallback
    handler and retry.</li>
</ol>

<h4>The Pipeline</h4>

<p>In the above pipeline, a shade tree is generated and compiled
for each <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiGPUProgram</span>. In
Gamebryo, a shade tree is encapsulated in an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMaterialConfigurator</span> object. A derived
class will look at the bits set in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiGPUProgramDescriptor</span> and determine which
uniform constants need to be wired to which nodes in the tree.
Uniform constants are encapsulated in the class <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMaterialResource</span>. Nodes in the tree are
encapsulated in the class <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMaterialNode</span>. Connections between the
input and output resources of a given node and other nodes or
uniform constants are encapsulated in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMaterialResourceBinding</span> class. Once all
of the connections (aka bindings) are established between all of
the nodes added to the tree, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Evaluate</span> method of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMaterialConfigurator</span> is called to
generate the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiGPUProgram</span> and
a set of the uniform input resources required to feed the program
appropriately.</p>

<h4>NiMaterialFragmentNodes</h4>

<p>When constructing a shade tree, it is necessary to create
nodes that have code snippets associated with them. These types
of nodes are called <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMaterialFragmentNode</span>s. A given node will
have a set of code snippets that correspond to different program
languages or hardware models for programs. This allows a shader
code writer a fair amount of flexibility with respect to
determining how their nodes will behave on different platforms
and hardware models. For instance, on a card with lesser shader
model support, the lighting algorithm may be significantly less
accurate but much faster. Higher model cards may be able to take
advantage of newer instructions or more complicated algorithms.
Each implementation of the fragment node must obey the set of
inputs and outputs for the overall fragment node. A shade tree is
not complete until all the inputs for all the nodes used are
satisfied. In many cases, a fragment node will define default
values for its input resources, allowing the shade tree to avoid
setting those resources if they are not different than the
defaults.</p>

<h4>NiMaterialNodeLibraries</h4>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMaterialNodes</span> can be
added to an application through <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMaterialNodeLibrary</span> objects. These
objects contain a set of material nodes that can be instantiated
into a shade tree. This allows the shade tree nodes to be
completely data-driven. There are currently two ways of
generating libraries, parsing an external XML file or converting
that XML file into a C++ class and linking it with your
application. The latter option is used by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiStandardMaterial</span> (a derived class of
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFragmentMaterial</span>
implementing the default rendering pipeline in Gamebryo). An XML
file in NiMain\StandardMaterialNodeLibrary contains all of the
fragments used in the material. Whenever a fragment is changed,
added, or removed, a batch file is used to call the <a href=
"../../Tools/NiMaterialNodeXMLLibraryParser/NiMaterialNodeXMLLibraryParser_Intro.htm">
DeveloperTools/NiMaterialNodeXMLLibraryParser</a> executable,
which will create a C++ class representing that library.
Alternatively, an application can parse the XML library itself
using the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMaterialNodeXMLLibraryReader/Introduction_to_NiMaterialNodeXMLLibraryReader.htm">
NiMaterialNodeXMLLibraryReader</a> class library.</p>

<h4>NiMaterialResources</h4>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMaterialResources</span> can be
one of a multitude of data types, including boolean values,
unsigned integers, floats, point2s, point3s, point4s, matrix3s,
matrix4s, colors, and textures and can be added to a shade tree
for many reasons. As stated previously, each node adds its own
set of input and output resources. Other resources can come from
one or more of the following locations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Constant . this type of entry is a constant entry in
    which the data does not change over time.</li>

    <li>Predefined . this type of entry is one of a pre-defined
    type that Gamebryo provides. This type of mapping includes
    values for common transformations, material colors, etc. See
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShaderConstantMap</span> for
    these values.</li>

    <li>Attribute . this type of entry is a value that is
    attached to the geometry being rendered. This type of mapping
    allows for per-object settings of constant values. An example
    would be a team color that is used in a shader. These values
    can be exposed to the artist in the tool-chain allowing for
    tweaking of values relevant to the 'look' of your rendered
    objects. The important thing to note is that these values
    will be PER-OBJECT.</li>

    <li>Global . this type of entry is similar to the Attribute
    method, but it is a global, application-registered data
    value. This mapping is useful for registering things such as
    light-related values, time of day, and other "global"
    variables.</li>

    <li>Object . this type of entry represents an object in the
    scene, such as a light or a projected texture effect.
    Different parameters, like light position or a texture, can
    be obtained from these entries. See <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiShaderConstantMap</span> for these
    values.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Fallbacks" id="Fallbacks"></a><h2>Fallbacks</h2>

<p>Occasionally, an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiFragmentMaterial</span> will fail to correctly
generate a working shader. This will often be because it
generated a GPU program that failed to compile. In such
circumstances, the material may want to try to recreate the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiGPUProgramDescriptors</span> in
step 4 of the process described above, simplifying them in the
process, and attempt to create the shader again. The material may
try to simplify the descriptors by breaking the effect up into
multiple passes, or by eliminating certain lights or
textures.</p>

<p>Materials can provide callback functions to act as fallbacks.
These callback functions will have this signature:</p>
<pre>
typedef bool (*SHADERFALLBACKFUNC)(
    NiMaterialDescriptor* pkMaterialDescriptor, ReturnCode eFailedRC,
    unsigned int uiFailedPass, RenderPassDescriptor* pkRenderPasses,
    unsigned int uiMaxCount, unsigned int&amp; uiCount,
    unsigned int&amp; uiFunctionData);
</pre>

<p>When the fallback function is called, it will get passed in
the full <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiMaterialDescriptor.htm">NiMaterialDescriptor</a></span>,
which describes the total effect. It also gets a <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiFragmentMaterial.htm#ReturnCode">ReturnCode</a></span>
that reports why the previous compilation attempt failed, the
identity of the pass that failed, and the array of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiFragmentMaterial.htm#RenderPassDescriptor">
RenderPassDescriptor</a></span> objects that contain descriptions
of all the passes. With this information, the fallback can try to
identify where the problem is, and what steps to take to rectify
it.</p>

<p>The fallback function needs to first determine whether or not
it can address the problem. If it can't, then it should return
false. Otherwise, the function should make its changes by
modifying the array of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiFragmentMaterial.htm#RenderPassDescriptor">
RenderPassDescriptor</a></span> objects. It can make a change to
every render pass in the array, or it can change only the pass
that failed, or it can add new passes or remove passes. It is
important, though, that when the function returns, the array of
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiFragmentMaterial.htm#RenderPassDescriptor">
RenderPassDescriptor</a></span> objects contains valid
descriptions of every pass - even the ones that may not have
failed. This is because for each fallback attempt, the material
will completely recreate the shader, in case the fallback
function made changes to those passes that had previously passed.
When fallback function returns successfully, it can put the new
pass count in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">uiCount</span>
parameter. Then, the material will attempt to continue creating
the shader from step 5.</p>

<p>Many fallback techniques operate best iteratively. For
example, consider a fallback technique that takes a failed pass
and moves half its lights to a new pass. If a pass with 8 lights
fails to compile, that pass can be broken up into two passes with
4 lights. If 4 lights is still too many, though, the fallback
function could get called again on the first pass (splitting that
pass into two passes with two lights) and then on the second pass
(splitting that pass similarly). Finally, the shader may get
created successfully.</p>

<p>This process can be achieved by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiFragmentMaterial</span> by the way it handles
the Boolean value returned from the fallback function. If the
function returns <span class="NDLSystemFont">false</span>, then
the material will consider that fallback function to have failed,
and will either move on to a new fallback function or return no
shader. But if the fallback function returns <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">true</span>, then the material will attempt to
create the shader from the modified render pass description
array, and if that attempt fails again, the material will call
the same fallback function again. In fact, the material will
continue to call the same callback function until the shader
creation succeeds, or the fallback function returns <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">false</span>.</p>

<p>The fallback function can even communicate with itself across
various attempts: the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">uiFunctionData</span> parameter is initialized to
0 the first time a fallback function is called, and the value is
passed in to each subsequent call to that fallback function. This
way, a fallback function can leave feedback to future iterations
of itself.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFragmentMaterial</span>
keeps a linear array of fallback functions that have been
registered with it, and will iterate through that list in order.
Refer to the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiFragmentMaterial.htm">NiFragmentMaterial</a></span>
class reference for the functions that can be used to add a new
fallback function to this list or manipulate it.</p>

<p>When the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFragmentMaterial</span>
is attempting a fallback function for the first time, it will
first call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GenerateShaderDescArray</span> to regenerate the
array of render pass descriptors. This may seem counterintuitive,
since the reason the fallback function is getting called is
because that array is known to fail, but it is done this way so
that each fallback function has the same starting point, and so
they won't interfere with each other's operations. This also
means that if an application wants one fallback function to
operate on the results of another fallback function, then the
first fallback function will need to call the second callback
function itself first. This can be a viable strategy, and is a
good use of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">uiFunctionData</span>
parameter to pass data from one iteration of a function to
another. For example, fallback function 2 can simply return the
results of fallback function 1 until fallback returns false. At
that point, fallback 2 can set a flag in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">uiFunctionData</span>, and from that point on,
fallback 2 can do its own work.</p>
