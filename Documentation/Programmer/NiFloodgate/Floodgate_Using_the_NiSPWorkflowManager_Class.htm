<h1>Floodgate Using the NiSPWorkflowManager Class</h1>

<p>Sometimes it is more efficient to batch several tasks 
 together in a single workflow, even though those tasks are started at 
 different locations in an application. Mesh Modifiers provide the most 
 common example of this in Gamebryo, where there are many meshes and no 
 one mesh has many tasks. Rather than create and queue many small <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflow.htm">NiSPWorkflow</a></span> 
 objects, it is more efficient to batch the tasks for many meshes.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager</span></a> class provides functionality 
 for batching <a href="../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPTask.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPTask</span></a> objects into a single workflow. 
 Applications submit tasks that an <a href="../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager</span></a> object adds to a workflow. 
 When the workflow is full, or when the application requests it, the workflow 
 is submitted to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStreamProcessor</span> 
 object for execution.</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>The constructor for an <a href="../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager</span></a> object takes two arguments. 
 The first controls the minimum number of tasks that must be added to a 
 workflow before the workflow is automatically submitted. This value can 
 be tuned to trade-off the total number of outstanding workflows against 
 the size of each workflow against the delay before a given task is submitted. 
 Larger values lead to fewer workflows of larger size that might take longer 
 to be submitted (because they require more tasks to fill them up).</p>

<p>The second argument is an estimate of the number of 
 task IDs that will be submitted. See below for the meaning of a task ID.</p>

<h2>Submitting Tasks</h2>

<p>Tasks are added to a workflow using the <a href="../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager::AddTask</span></a> function. 
 This assigns the task to a workflow. If the workflow is full, it might 
 be submitted for execution. The workflow is returned by the function so 
 that applications can track outstanding jobs.</p>

<p>Some tasks are related and must appear in the same workflow. 
 For example, one task may have a output streams that is used as the input 
 for another task. These two tasks must be in the same workflow for their 
 dependency to be recognized. Tasks that are related are added using the 
 <a href="../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager::AddRelatedTask</span></a> function, 
 which never causes the submission of a workflow. Hence, multiple calls 
 to the <a href="../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager::AddRelatedTask</span></a> function 
 end up in the same workflow. The <a href="../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager::FinishRelatedTasks</span></a> 
 function is used to tell the manager that it is safe to submit the workflow 
 for processing. The workflow will then be submitted if it is full.</p>

<h2>Delayed Submission</h2>

<p>Sometimes it is desirable to delay the start of processing 
 for a task. For example, a task that is launched during scene graph update 
 that relies on a finished update should not be executed until the end 
 of update. This is the case for skinning mesh modifiers. The <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm">NiSPWorkflowManager::AddTask</a></span> and <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm">NiSPWorkflowManager::AddRelatedTask</a></span> functions 
 have an argument that causes the workflow to not be submitted, even if 
 full. Rather, the workflow is placed on an internal queue. The queue must 
 later be flushed using the &nbsp;<a href="../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager::FlushTaskGroup</span></a> 
 function.</p>

<h2>Task Group IDs</h2>

<p>Tasks that appear in the same workflow will be submitted 
 for execution at the same time, and will be completed at the same time. 
 Tasks that produce results for different parts of an application, say 
 AI processing and rendering, should not be forced to execute together 
 as this might force the application to block on a result that is not needed. 
 For example, Gamebryo mesh modifiers sometimes produce results for the 
 culling phase and sometime produce results for rendering. It is unnecessary 
 to put these tasks in the same workflow, and to do so would block the 
 culling phase on results that are not needed until rendering.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager</span></a> object supports a Task 
 Group ID associated with each task. Only tasks with the same ID will be 
 placed in the same workflow. The manager can simultaneously manage many 
 task groups - the approximate number should be given in the constructor. 
 Operations can also be restricted to certain task IDs or to IDs that appear 
 the same when masked. For example, all <a href="../NiMesh/Introduction_to_Mesh_Modifiers.htm">mesh 
 modifiers</a> use their <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiSyncArgs.htm">NiSyncArgs</a></span> 
 to construct a task ID. This forces the manager to only combine tasks 
 that must start and complete at the same time.</p>

<h2>Thread Safety</h2>

<p>Floodgate <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflow</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPTask</span> objects are not inherently 
 thread safe. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager</span> 
 class should be used to enforce thread safety when multiple threads are 
 constructing workflows.</p>

<p>Create one <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager</span> 
 object per-thread and restrict calls for each thread to that thread's 
 object. For example, when using <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm#UpdateFunctions">NiAVObject::Update</a></span> 
 from separate threads, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> call 
 from each thread should use a thread-local <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshUpdateProcess.htm">NiMeshUpdateProcess</a></span> 
 object containing a thread-local <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager</span> 
 object. An <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiBatchedUpdateProcess.htm">NiBatchedUpdateProcess</a></span> 
 object may be used in place of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshUpdateProcess</span>.</p>

<h2>Floodgate and the Game Framework</h2>

<p>Several system services in the Game Framework require an
   <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager</span> object. The
   <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_scene_graph_svc.htm">
   Scene Graph Service</a> provides access to an object that other services use. For example, the
   <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_render_svc.htm">Render Service</a> and
   related classes use the Scene Graph Service's workflow manager for culling operations.
   We recommend that application-specific services also use this workflow manager when one is
   required.
