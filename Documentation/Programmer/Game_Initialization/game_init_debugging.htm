<h1>Debugging game initialization</h1>

<p>A number of things could go wrong during game initialization.
A good place to start is the game's log file. The game writes
errors and warnings to the log destination that is specified in
your application main. See the <a href=
"../Logging/logging_intro.htm">Logging, Asserts, and Debuggers:
Introduction</a> for details on how to setup logging.</p>

<p>A log file will only contain messages for the levels that are
specified in your config file. So, you should make sure that you
have all modules showing logs up to error level 3 (UPTO_ERR3).
See <a href="../Logging/logging_tuning.htm">Tuning logging,
asserts, and debugging performance</a> for details on how to
change log levels.</p>

<p>Now that we have log files showing errors, look for the |Err*|
keywords in your log. The module name will help narrow down the
area, and the message will show what went wrong. For example:</p>
<pre>
TimeStamp|Level|Module|File|Line|Message|
2009/01/22 19:00:06.062|<b>Lvl1</b>|ConfigManager|||Creating a
ConfigManager instance 0x00A19444|
2009/01/22 17:17:06.128|<b>Err2</b>|ConfigManager|||Error: Could
not find Config1.ini|
</pre>

<h2>Common problems and their solutions</h2>

<h3>Loading the correct world</h3>

<p>Make sure that the Asset Locator Service (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_asset_locator_svc.htm">
efd::AssetLocatorService</a></span>) is fetching the correct
block file. Double check that you are specifying the correct file
in your load world request. See <a href=
"game_init_load_assets.htm">About loading assets</a>.</p>
<pre>
|Err1|Asset Locator Service found no assets that matched URI 'urn:MyInvalidWorld'|
</pre>

<h3>Loading the correct Config file</h3>

<p>Make sure that the Configuration Manager (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_config_mgr.htm">efd::ConfigManager</a></span>)
is using the correct config file. Look for messages similar to
the following to make sure that the game has loaded the desired
config file.</p>
<pre>
|Lvl1|ConfigManager|Creating a configuration source 'Config.ini' (0x0266E7B4) of type 2|
</pre>

<p>If not, check your main function to see if you are passing the
right path to your Configuration Manager instantiation:</p>
<pre>
efd::IConfigManagerPtr spConfigManager = EE_NEW ConfigManage ("Config.ini", 0, NULL, false);
</pre>

<h4>Using a corrupt asset metadata</h4>

<p>Make sure your asset metadata is up to date. When you find a
error in the log file that indicates that an asset could not be
found while in fact you know it is in the right place and that
your asset web path is pointing to the right directory, it means
that your metadata is out of date. See <a href=
"../AssetRuntimeService/asset_runtime_best_practice.htm">Asset
Runtime Service Best Practices</a> to ensure that this happens
before you run the game. </p>

<h3>Using the correct scripting path and loading the correct
built-ins</h3>

<p>Make sure that you have all of the helper scripts in your
scripting path. Your scripting engine and behaviors might be
using helper scripts that are usually not found next to the
game's executable. If behaviors are not running, this could mean
that the scripts were not found (for example, or my character
isn't animating). Look for errors similar to the following in
your log file:</p>
<pre>
|Lua error: [string "require("scheduler");scheduler.init()"]:1: module 'scheduler' not found:
no field package.preload['scheduler']
no file '.\Data\Scripts\scheduler.lua'
no file '.\Data\Scripts\scheduler.lc'
no file '..\ML\SDK\Win32\Lua\scheduler.dll'
no file '..\ML\SDK\Win32\Lua\scheduler.lua'
</pre>
<pre>
|Scheduler.lua failed to load. Check your LUA_PATH to make sure
scheduler.lua is available. Also ensure the Lua and Lua Built-in
sections are defined in the config.ini file. Lua scripting is now
disabled.|
</pre>

<p>The fix is to verify that you have specified the correct
script paths in your config file:</p>
<pre>
[ScriptEngine.Lua]
LoadBuiltin#=egfLua!luaopen_BehaviorAPI
LoadBuiltin#=egmAnimationLua!luaopen_egmAnimation
SystemScriptPath1=./Data/Scripts ...
</pre>

<h3>Using the correct product version</h3>

<p>Make sure that your PATH and EMERGENT_PATH points to the
correct SDK. If you have multiple versions of the product
installed, you might be using a different version of the SDK or a
generated one if you compiled and did not use the binary.</p>

                If your application is crashing on shutdown, make
                sure that you are releasing smart pointers
                referenced by other services and that you are
                destroying your system services in the right
                order.
