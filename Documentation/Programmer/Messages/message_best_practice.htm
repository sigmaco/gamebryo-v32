<h1>Best practices for working with messages</h1>

<p>Emergent recommends the following best practices when you are working with messages:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Any class derived from <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/efd/efd__IBase.htm">efd::IBase</a></span>
    may subscribe to receive messages, and the
    <a href="../../Reference/efd/efd__MessageService.htm">Message Service</a>
    stores the subscribing objects as
    <a href="../../Reference/efd/efd__SmartPointer.htm">smart pointers</a>. Hence, a
    smart pointer to the subscribing object is released during an <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    Unsubscribe</span> call, which will lead to destruction of the object unless another object
    still holds a smart pointer. Similarly, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span>
    method of the Message Service releases all the smart pointers to subscribing services. It is
    easy to introduce shutdown crashes with this arrangement. Follow these rules when creating
    objects that subscribe to messages:
    <ul>
        <li>A smart pointer to the subscribing object should always be held by some other object
        that lives beyond the unsubscribe call. This prevents the premature deletion of the
        subscribing object. Note that the Service Manager holds smart pointers to system service
        objects, so this problem almost never arises with system services as subscribers.
        </li>
        <li>The subscribing object must never make use of the message service during destruction.
        Doing so may cause the subscribing object to try to access the message service while the
        latter is shutting down.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Use data-driven enums to create unique ClassID values. Every message class must have a
    unique ClassID and must properly use Foundation RTTI.</li>

    <li>Do not make assumptions about the order in which multiple handlers are invoked for a single
    message. If there is an order dependency, consider having one object call a method on the other
    object, or fire off another message that indicates that the first object has met the required
    dependency.</li>

    <li>Make use of <span class="NDLSystemFont">StreamMessage</span> and <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">MessageWrapper</span> when prototyping. This requires minimal boilerplate code
    and makes it trivial to add or remove data members. If needed, messages can be optimized to use
    a custom message class in the future, but be sure to update the message handler macros.</li>

    <li>Write handler methods with a signature to expect the most derived message class possible.
    This avoids having to do unnecessary dynamic casting. The internal MessageService data
    structures are optimized to route messages of different types directly to a method with minimal
    use of dynamic casts.</li>

    <li>Avoid using switch statements in handlers to distinguish between message classes. Instead,
    use a different handler method per message class. It is more efficient and requires less
    explicit casting.</li>

    <li>Do not send more than a few dozen messages per tick (frame). Local messages help with loose
    coupling of large systems, but they are not intended to completely replace method calls and
    virtual functions as the interface between components.</li>

    <li>Consider carefully how to decompose message sets into categories. You can use categories
    for more than object or entity destinations. You can use them for area of effect, subsystem
    encapsulation, partitioning between multiple game instances or players in a single process, and
    much more. The existing decomposition of bits used by LightSpeed systems is not the only way to
    organize Category space.</li>

    <li>Do not edit or reuse a delivered message. Other handlers may still want to process it.
    Message parameters are declared const for this reason. If you need to do side-effect-free
    modifications to a message (like iterating or uncompressing and so on), consider using the
    mutable keyword on the members of the message affected.</li>

    <li>Avoid rapid subscription changes. Most commonly, system service subscriptions will be set
    up at initialization time and torn down at shutdown time. Subscriptions might also change in
    response to uncommon events such as joining an online game or entering a new area of the
    world.</li>

    <li>Do not confuse a message with an event. Events are entity behavior invocations that are
    scheduled in game time by <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_scheduler.htm">egf::Scheduler</a></span>.
    Messages are a more general system utility; they operate using real-time delays and continue to
    be delivered even if the Scheduler is paused or not fully running. Messages can be used for any
    sort of notification.</li>

    <li>Use nouns to name messages (for example, FooCommand, BarResponse, EnterStateBazRequest).
    Use verbs to name handler methods (for example, DoFoo, ProcessBar, EnterStateBaz).</li>

    <li>Recognize the difference between <span class="NDLSystemFont">Send</span> and <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">SendImmediate</span>. Send causes the message to be delivered on the next tick.
    This can be invaluable to avoid deep recursion and re-entrancy problems. SendImmediate acts
    like a loosely coupled function call or synchronous callback.</li>

    <li>Avoid sending immediate messages from inside another message handler. When you are inside a
    message handler, other handlers for the current message may or may not have been called yet. If
    you send another immediate message during the previous handler, consumers who wanted to receive
    both the current message and the message you are sending can get those messages in any order.
    The resulting order could even change when the application is recompiled. This can lead to
    timing problems that are difficult to debug and differences in behavior for different build
    configurations.</li>
