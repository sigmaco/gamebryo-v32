  <h1>
    NiTerrain Storage</h1>
  <p>
    The terrain engine manages a large amount of data, in order to do this efficiently,
    the data must be stored on disk in an easily accessible manner. This section describes
    the storage system for terrain data, how to configure it, and how to extend it.</p>
  <h2>
    Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
    The terrain engine stores all of its data within a 'terrain archive path'. This
    archive path defines a single directory within the application's data directory,
    under which all of a specific terrain asset's data is stored. Depending on the file
    format that has been configured, different files within this directory will be used
    to define each sector and one file to define the basic parameters of the terrain
    asset across all sectors. Generally, only one terrain asset may be stored within
    a specific directory.</p>
  <p>
    Within each file stored on disk, there are several fields of data that require storage.
    Some of these fields are compulsory, whilst others are optional, these may be generated
    on the fly when streaming the sector, or that will simply not be available when
    rendering. The following table describes each data field that is stored and what
    happens if it is not available.</p>

    The above data is saved and loaded from disk through two interfaces, <span class="NDLSystemFont">
      NiTerrainFile</span>, and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSectorFile</span>.
    See <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainFile.htm">
      NiTerrainFile</a></span>, and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainSectorFile.htm">
        NiTerrainSectorFile</a></span> for more detailed information on these interfaces
    can be found in the class reference.</p>
  <p>
    One feature of the terrain eng 
    class reference for more detailed information.</p>
  <p>
    One feature of the terrain engine is the ability to customize the on disk 
    storage format of terrain data through the use of a 'storage policy'. If 
    necessary, a developer may choose to implement their own 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainFile</span>/<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSectorFile</span> classes, and configure the terrain to use them 
    through an appropriate storage policy. This allows the developer to choose 
    exactly which data is stored on disk, and which data is generated at runtime, 
    potentially minimising disk access and utilizing unused processing power during 
    loading, or even optimizing how that data is stored on disk.data policy allows a developer to
    link their own data loading/unloading to the terrain's streaming system. This feature
    is used to implement the PhysX integration into the terrain engine, allowing the
    physX data to be loaded when individual sectors are loaded/unloaded. This might
    be extended to load further data or integrate another physics system.</p>
  <p>
    Futher details on configuring these storage extensions are found in the following sections.</p>
  <h2>
    Configuring a Storage Policy
  </h2>
  <p>
    In order to configure the terrain to use a different file format the developer may
    specify a "storage policy" on the terrain object. A storage policy defines a set
    of functions to use when opening terrain files and sector files for read and write.
    The terrain object will then use these functions to create instances of the 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainFile</span>
    and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSectorFile</span> classes through which it will stream its data to/from disk.
    For information on the signatures of these functions, please consult the class reference.</p>
  <p>
    The following code shows how a user may configure a terrain storage policy and apply
    it to a particular terrain object. Please note that this configuration of the terrain
    object should happen before any loading occurs on the object and changes during
    runtime may have undefined effects on the operation of the terrain engine.</p>
    
<pre>NiTerrain::StoragePolicy kTerrainStorage;
kTerrainStorage.m_kOpenSectorRead = &amp;NiTerrainSectorFileRaw::Open;
kTerrainStorage.m_kOpenSectorWrite = &amp;NiTerrainSectorFile::Open;

NiTerrain* pkTerrain = GetTerrain();
pkTerrain-&gt;SetStoragePolicy(kTerrainStorage);</pre>
  <p>
    Please note that whilst the file format is customizable, some functions of the game
    framework for terrain assume the use of the default storage format. Such as Rapid
    Iteration, and many of the terrain tools within Toolbench. These assumptions however
    only revolve around the naming conventions of the files themselves, so provided
    custom formats comply to the same naming conventions as the defaults, there should
    be no problems.</p>

  <h2>
    The Default Storage Format
  </h2>
  <p>
    The default storage format for the terrain engine is implemented through the 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainFileVersion2.htm">NiTerrainFileVersion2</a></span> class and the 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainSectorFileVersion6.htm">NiTerrainSectorFileVersion6</a></span> class. Whilst providing support for 
    the latest file format, these classes also provide backwards compatibility with previous 
    versions of the terrain file formats to allow their data to be converted to the new format.
    The default format is designed to store all the data from the table of data fields
    to minimize the amount of processing of terrain data during the load process.</p>
  <p>
    The latest version of the terrain file format is drastically different to that of
    previous versions. Some of the features of the current terrain file format are listed
    here to provide an insight into how the data is stored on disk.</p>
  <h3>
    NiTerrainFileVersion3
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A single XML file 'root.terrain' within the terrain archive for a single terrain.
    </li>
    <li>
      Only one terrain may be stored within a particular archive path.
    </li>
    <li>
      A list of surface references are kept as an index of surfaces for the entire terrain.
    </li>
    <li>
      All the basic configuration of the terrain data is stored within this file.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    NiTerrainSectorVersion6
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A single binary file 'sector_X_Y.dof' within the terrain archive for each sector.
    </li>
    <li>The format stores each data field in the file in a 'block' format. Each data field
      is represented by a 'block' in the file. </li>
    <li>2D arrays of data such as heightfields and maps are stored as 2D images of varying
      formats and may support compression in the future or by extension. </li>
    <li>Other data is stored as simple array fields of data. </li>
    <li>Data is no longer stored in a quadtree style, geometry-centric format. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Note: Whilst the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSectorVersion6</span> file format does have points from which
    compression may be implemented for the 2D image blocks, no compression has been
    implemented for this version. If a developer determines that compression is necessary
    for their application, they may extend the file format to support a compression
    technique of their choosing. A lossless technique such as PNG style compression
    may be a good choice. Please consult the documentation on <a href="#ImplementingCompression">
  	implementing compression </a> for further information.</p>
  <p>
    A typical terrain with 4 sectors using this file format may have the following folder
    heirachy:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>TerrainArchivePath\ </li>
    <ul>
      <li>root.terrain </li>
      <li>sector_0_0.dof </li>
      <li>sector_1_0.dof </li>
      <li>sector_1_1.dof </li>
      <li>sector_0_-1.dof </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When a terrain object is created, the storage policy is configured by default to
    use this default file format. To explicly configure the terrain to use this format,
    the following code may be used:</p>
  <pre>NiTerrain::StoragePolicy kTerrainStorage;
kTerrainStorage.m_kOpenSectorRead = &amp;NiTerrainSectorFile::Open;
kTerrainStorage.m_kOpenSectorWrite = &amp;NiTerrainSectorFile::Open;
kTerrainStorage.m_kOpenTerrainRead = &amp;NiTerrainFile::Open;
kTerrainStorage.m_kOpenTerrainWrite = &amp;NiTerrainFile::Open;

NiTerrain* pkTerrain = GetTerrain();
pkTerrain-&gt;SetStoragePolicy(kTerrainStorage);</pre>
  <p>
    Similarly, the following code may be used to reset the terrain to its default file
    format:</p>
  <pre>NiTerrain::StoragePolicy kTerrainStorage;
NiTerrain* pkTerrain = GetTerrain();
pkTerrain-&gt;SetStoragePolicy(kTerrainStorage);</pre>
  <h2>
    The 'Developer' Storage Format
  </h2>
  <p>
    A completely separate file format has been released with the engine to help in the
    development and debugging process that may be useful for other developers when using
    the terrain system. This format is intended to allow developers to view/edit the
    data stored in the sectors of the terrain via external tools to aid in the debugging
    or tools process. This format is not recommended for released applications or the
    sole storage format of assets as it will not be supported through backwards compatibility
    in future releases of the engine.</p>
  <p>
    This format customization is only applicable to sector files, and as such, the storage
    of basic terrain data is simply dealt with via the default file format. The following
    dotpoints describe the features of this file format:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A multi-file format. Several files are stored, one for each data field. </li>
    <li>All non-PhysX data fields are supported. </li>
    <li>All files are stored in a directory below the terrain archive path to allow the
      files to be easily purged from release data sets. </li>
    <li>The following files are stored: </li>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">ToolData\Sector_X_Y.Heights.uint16.raw</span> </li>
      <ul>
        <li>A raw file containing 16-bit unsigned integers representing the heightfield of
          the sector. </li>
      </ul>
      <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">ToolData\Sector_X_Y.Normals.float2.raw</span> </li>
      <ul>
        <li>A raw file containing 2 channels of 32-bit floats representing the X and Y components
          of the sector's normals. </li>
      </ul>
      <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">ToolData\Sector_X_Y.Tangents.float2.raw</span> </li>
      <ul>
        <li>A raw file containing 2 channels of 32-bit floats representing the X and Z components
          of the sector's tangents. </li>
      </ul>
      <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">ToolData\Sector_X_Y.LD_NormalMap.rgb24.tga</span> </li>
      <ul>
        <li>A tga file containing 3 channels of bytes representing the low detail normal map
          used for the sector. </li>
      </ul>
      <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">ToolData\Sector_X_Y.LD_DiffuseMap.rgba32.tga</span> </li>
      <ul>
        <li>A tga file containing 4 channels of bytes representing the low detail diffuse
          map used for the sector. </li>
      </ul>
      <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">ToolData\Sector_X_Y.Config.xml</span> </li>
      <ul>
        <li>An XML file describing the basic configuration of the data stored in the sector.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">ToolData\Sector_X_Y.Bounds.xml</span> </li>
      <ul>
        <li>An XML file describing the bounding information for each cell within the sector.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">ToolData\Sector_X_Y.SurfaceIndex.xml</span> </li>
      <ul>
        <li>An XML file describing the what surfaces are used on each leaf of the sector.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">ToolData\Sector_X_Y.BlendMasks.rgba32.tga</span> </li>
      <ul>
        <li>A tga file containing 4 channels of bytes representing the blend masks for each
          surface on each cell. Note: this image contains all the blend masks for the sector
          stitched together with pixel duplication on the borders of each cell. </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This format (or similar formats) may also prove useful for providing meaninful differentials
    between different versions of art assets. It is not recommended as the main storage
    format though, as mergers between different versions of each sector's files could
    lead to undefined results and data loss.</p>
  <p>
    A typical terrain with 2 sectors using this file format may have the following folder
    heirachy:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">TerrainArchivePath\ </span> </li>

    To explicly configure the terrain to use this format, the following code may be
    used:</p>
  <pre>NiTerrain::StoragePolicy kTerrainStorage;
kTerrainStorage.m_kOpenSectorRead = &amp;NiTerrainSectorFileDeveloper::Open;
kTerrainStorage.m_kOpenSectorWrite = &amp;NiTerrainSectorFileDeveloper::Open;
kTerrainStorage.m_kOpenTerrainRead = &amp;NiTerrainFile::Open;
kTerrainStorage.m_kOpenTerrainWrite = &amp;NiTerrainFile::Open;

NiTerrain* pkTerrain = GetTerrain();
pkTerrain-&gt;SetStoragePolicy(kTerrainStorage);</pre>
  <h2>
    Setting Up a Custom File Format
  </h2>
  <p>
    A developer may implement their own terrain file format by implementing the 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainFile</span>
    and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSectorFile</span> interfaces in their own classes. An appropriate static 'open'
    method should then be defined to allow the terrain engine to instantiate these objects
    on demand.</p>
  <p>
    When developing your own format, please consult the table of data fields in the
    introduction to understand what fields are required and which are optional, and
    consult the class reference for the interfaces for detailed information on each
    function being implemented. In particular, the 'precache' function on the NiTerrainSectorFile
    class is used to both determine what data is available in the file, and to preload
    the requested data from the disk. By loading the data from disk in this function,
    the developer can be assured that only one sector's data is being loaded from disk
    at a time, minimising disk access contention.</p>
  <p>
    A user's custom data format may then be assigned to a terrain object using the instructions
    demonstrated in the other sections of this documentation.</p>
  <h2>
    <a name="ImplementingCompression"></a>Implementing Compression
  </h2>
  <p>
    Whilst compression is not implemented in the current version of the terrain's sector
    file format, it can be added with minimal changes to the existing format, though
    it would require a source license to the engine. The following steps would need
    to be taken:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Extend the implementations of the following functions within the 
      <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSectorFileVersion6::ImageDataBlock</span>
      class to implement the compression algorithms of your choice: </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <pre>virtual bool NiTerrainSectorFileVersion6::ImageDataBlock::CompressFromStream(
                         ImageCompressionMode::VALUE eCompressionMode,
                         efd::UInt8* pBuffer, efd::UInt32 uiBufferLength,
                         efd::UInt32 uiWidth, efd::UInt32 uiHeight, efd::UInt16 uiNumChannels,
                         efd::UInt16 uiBytesPerChannel);</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <pre>virtual bool NiTerrainSectorFileVersion6::ImageDataBlock::CompressFromImageData(
                        ImageCompressionMode::VALUE eCompressionMode,
                        NiPixelData* pkSource);</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <pre>virtual bool NiTerrainSectorFileVersion6::ImageDataBlock::DecompressToImageData(
                        NiPixelData*&amp; pkSource);</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <pre>virtual bool NiTerrainSectorFileVersion6::ImageDataBlock::DecompressToStream(
                        efd::UInt8* pBuffer, efd::UInt32 uiBufferLength);</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Override the implementations of the 'write' functions of the data fields you wish
      to compress, specifying the compression mode you wish to use for that datafield
      as an argument to the ImageDataBlock.<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    A potential candidate for the compression algorithm may be the PNG compression algorithm,
    as it is both lossless, and provides a good level of compression. Please be careful
    when using 'lossy' compression techniques to compress the height, lighting and blending
    data, as this may cause inconsistencies and seams to appear between cells and sectors
    of the terrain.</p>
  <h2>
    Converting Between File Formats
  </h2>
  <p>
    Although no specific tool is provided to allow a developer to convert between different
    file formats, one technique to convert between formats is to set the 'read' functor
    of the storage policy to the open function of one format, and point the 'write'
    function of the storage policy to the open function of another format. The developer
    may then force the terrain to load data and save it out again, causing it to write
    out the loaded data in a new file format.</p>
  <p>
    Another variation of this technique may to write a file format that is two formats
    in one. This could be done by writing a version of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSectorFile</span> that uses
    two further <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSectorFile</span> objects that are generated when the open function
    is called. This would allow the terrain engine to write out two separate versions
    of the file format at once, whilst reading from only one format.</p>
  <h2>
    Configuring a Custom Data Policy
  </h2>
  <p>
    Custom data policies are intended for use as a hook into the terrain's streaming
    system that will allow a developer to know when they can load data related to a
    specific sector of the terrain. One such use for this system is the implementation
    of a PhysX integration to the terrain (Note: this integration is included). Developers
    may find this extension point useful to further extend the physics of the terrain,
    or implement their own terrain-aware algorithms within their applications.</p>
  <p>
    When developing a custom data policy, there are a number of things to be aware of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Only one custom data policy may be applied to the terrain at once. Though this
      does not mean a developer can't define a 'multi-policy policy' that simply references
      a list of custom data policies to use on the terrain. </li>
    <li>Configuration of the custom data policy should happen before any terrain loading
      occurs </li>
    <li>The custom data policy must be derived from <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrain::CustomDataPolicy</span>. </li>
    <li>The custom data policy object may be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously,
      as it is heavily bound to the terrain streaming system. Be sure to use appropriate
      locks and syncronization mechanisms to avoid difficult and intermittant problems.<br>
    </li>
    <li>The functions prefixed with 'begin' and 'end' are only called by the 'update'
      thread (the renderer thread). This allows certain renderer functions to be called,
      and assumptions about the current state of objects to be assumed whilst these functions
      are called (note, that whilst the update thread is executing a begin function, other
      threads may still be executing other functions on the object).&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Once the custom data policy has been defined and implemented. It may then be assigned
    to the terrain object when it is created using code similar to the following.</p>
    
<pre>NiTerrain* pkTerrain = GetTerrain();
TerrainDataPolicy* pkTerrainData = EE_NEW TerrainDataPolicy();
pkTerrain-&gt;SetCustomDataPolicy(pkTerrainData);</pre>
