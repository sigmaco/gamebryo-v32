  <h1>
    NiTerrain Painting and Deformation</h1>
  <p>
    This section of the documentation discusses the use of the 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrain.htm">NiTerrain</a></span> interfaces
    to paint and deform the terrain programatically. For information on how to use the
    tools provided in toolbench, please refer to the artist's guide to the terrain toolbench
    plugin.</p>
  <p>
  The terrain engine supports painting and deformation through a set of interfaces
  on the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrain</span> object. These functions allow both the ability to read data from
  the terrain's deformable information, and to write new data through transactions
  with the interface. Transactions are defined as either a read or a write operation
  and revolve around 'deformation buffers'.</p>
 <p>
  Currently the terrain supports changes to the heightfield and blend masks. The toolbench
  plugin for terrain utilizes these interfaces to provide a painting system for building
  scenes with terrains. The following functions make up the terrain deformation interface.
  </p>
<pre>bool NiTerrain::GetHeightMap(NiRect&lt;efd::SInt32&gt; kTerrainSpaceRegion, 
    HeightMapBuffer* pkBuffer, NiTerrainDataSnapshot* pkSnapshot = NULL);
  
bool NiTerrain::SetHeightMap(HeightMapBuffer* pkBuffer);
  
bool NiTerrain::GetSurfaceMask(const NiSurface* pkSurface, 
    NiRect&lt;efd::SInt32&gt; kTerrainSpaceRegion, SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkMaskBuffer, 
    SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkMaskSumBuffer = NULL, NiTerrainDataSnapshot* pkSnapshot = NULL);
  
bool NiTerrain::GetSurfaceMask(efd::SInt32 uiSurfaceIndex, 
    NiRect&lt;efd::SInt32&gt; kTerrainSpaceRegion, SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkMaskBuffer, 
    SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkMaskSumBuffer = NULL, NiTerrainDataSnapshot* pkSnapshot = NULL);
  
bool NiTerrain::SetSurfaceMask(const NiSurface* pkSurface, SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkBuffer,
    SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkMaskSumBuffer);
  
bool NiTerrain::SetSurfaceMask(efd::SInt32 uiSurfaceIndex, SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkBuffer,
    SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkMaskSumBuffer);
  
void RestoreDataSnapshot(NiTerrainDataSnapshot* pkSnapshot);</pre>
  
  <p>
    These functions abstract the duplication of data within the terrain engine that
    is required to eliminate seams between meshes and morphing and relevant lighting
    data, allowing the developer to naively set the data and be confident that the desired
    effect will be acheived in the geometry or blendmasks.</p>
  <p>
    All write operations are limited to operating when the Terrain engine is in 'toolmode',
    which may be configured at the beginning of an application through the following
    static function.</p>
  <pre>static void NiTerrain::SetInToolMode(bool bInToolMode);</pre>
  <p>
    Please consult the <a href="Introduction_to_NiTerrain_Library.htm">Terrain documentation</a> and

  <h2>
    Deformation Buffers
  </h2>
  <p>
    Deformation buffers generic objects used to store data of a specific type for a
    specific region of the terrain. Two types of deformation buffers exist in the painting
    and deformation system, these include the HeightMapBuffer object and the SurfaceMaskBuffer
    object.</p>
  <p>
    Each deformation buffer object stores the following information about its stored
    data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The terrain space region that the buffer represents - represented in floats to identify the deviation from the requested data</li>
    <li>The range of sectors that the buffer spans. </li>
    <li>The relative data point indexes for those sectors that the buffer spans. </li>
    <li>The width and height of the buffer. </li>
    <li>A buffer containing a copy of the data in the described region. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainDeformationBuffer.htm">NiTerrainDeformationBuffer</a></span> object is a templated class, allowing the type of
    data stored within it to be customized according to the data field being modified.
    As such, HeightMapBuffers store a buffer of UInt16 values, and the SurfaceMaskBuffer
    object stores a buffer of UInt8 values.</p>
  <h2>
    Heightmap Painting
  </h2>
  <p>
    The process of changing the terrain's heightmap is fairly simple and can be burned
    down into three steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Fetch the current heightmap data from the terrain. </li>
    <li>Modify the data that needs changing. </li>
    <li>Push the new heightmap data back to the terrain. </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>
    Step 1
  </h3>
  <p>
    The first step in this process is acomplished by using the following function defined
    on the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrain</span> class.</p>
    
<pre>bool NiTerrain::GetHeightMap(NiRect&lt;efd::SInt32&gt; kTerrainSpaceRegion, 
    HeightMapBuffer* pkBuffer, NiTerrainDataSnapshot* pkSnapshot = NULL);</pre>
  <p>
    There are three main parameters to this function, the first parameter (kTerrainSpaceRegion)
    defines the region of the terrain that the user wishes to fetch the heightmap data
    for. The second parameter defines the buffer object that the data is to be copied
    into, and the third allows snapshots of the existing terrain data to be appended
    for storage (details on the data snapshot system can be found later in this section
    of the documentation).</p>
  <p>
    The main task involved in this step is defining the region of the terrain to get
    the data for. This involves selecting the inclusive region of verticies to get the
    height data for from the terrain object. The following diagram is used to illustrate
    how the data region is calculated:</p>
  <div class="FigureContainer">
    <img alt="Calculated data region" src="images/dataregioncalc.png">
    <p class="FigureCaption">
      Diagram: <i>Calculated data region</i></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    In the above diagram, a Multi-sector 8x8 terrain is depicted. In the diagram sector
    [0,0] is in the bottom left corner, the intersection of each blue line is the location
    of a vertex, the terrain space index of each vertex is determined by the numbers
    allong the axis of the diagram, the red, dashed lines represent the borders of sectors
    and the shaded yellow area represents the region of the terrain we wish to fetch
    the data for.</p>
  <p>
    The 'terrain space region' for the shaded area in the diagram would be defined by
    the following rectangle object:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>kTerrainSpaceRegion.m_left = 5 </li>
    <li>kTerrainSpaceRegion.m_bottom = 3 </li>
    <li>kTerrainSpaceRegion.m_right = 11 </li>
    <li>kTerrainSpaceRegion.m_top = 11 </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Note: The specified region is an inclusive range, thus the returned buffer object
    will return data for the specified verts within the region including the extreme
    values. This also means that if a region with the values all equal to '0' then only
    the data for the vert at [0,0] would be returned in the buffer object. It is also
    important to note that if the specified region overlaps areas of the terrain where
    no sectors exist, then those areas of the buffer will contain 0 values.</p>
  <p>
    The following code demonstates the execution of this step:</p>

<pre>NiRect&lt;NiInt32&gt; kRegion;
kRegion.m_left = 5;
kRegion.m_right = 11; 
kRegion.m_top = 11;
kRegion.m_bottom = 3;

HeightMapBuffer buffer;
NiTerrain* pkTerrain = GetTerrain();
pkTerrain-&gt;GetHeightMap(kRegion, &amp;buffer);</pre>
  <h3>
    Step 2
  </h3>
  <p>
    The data from the HeightMapBuffer object may now be modified according to the deformation
    required by the application. The data from the buffer may be accessed through the
    HeightMapBuffer::GetBuffer() function. Each UInt16 value in the buffer represents
    one vert The following code snippet demonstrates increasing the height of the verts
    in the specified region by 10 points.</p>
    
<pre>NiUInt16* puiHeights = buffer.GetBuffer();
for (NiUInt32 iX = 0; iX &lt; buffer.GetWidth(); ++iX)
{
    for (NiUInt32 iY = 0; iY &lt; buffer.GetHeight(); ++iY)
    {
        NiUInt32 uiIndex = iX + iY * buffer.GetWidth();
        puiHeights[uiIndex] += 10;
    }
}</pre>
  <p>
    Users may feel free develop their own algorithms for modifying the heights returned
    in the heightmap buffer object.</p>
  <h3>
    Step 3
  </h3>
  <p>
    The final step of the heightmap deformation process is to push the data back to
    the terrain. This is done through the following function interface:</p>
    
<pre>bool NiTerrain::SetHeightMap(HeightMapBuffer* pkBuffer);</pre>
  <p>
    By calling this function, the terrain will take the heightmap buffer object and
    copy the information it stores back into the relevant sectors. These sectors will
    then request that the streaming system regenerate all the relevant information from
    the heightmap, such as normals, tangents, and the low detail normal map. Note that
    these new calculations are only performed upon the area that has been defined by
    the heightmap buffer (the region given back in step 1). This function blocks until
    the terrain's data has been completely updated and finished recalculating.</p>
  <p>
    The following code would be used to complete the example code of this section:</p>

<pre>pkTerrain-&gt;SetHeightMap(&amp;buffer);</pre>
  <h2>
    Surface Mask Painting
  </h2>
  <p>
    Like heightmap sculpting, surface mask painting is composed of a few steps, though
    with a few extra complexities that need to be taken into account at each stage.
    These steps are as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Fetch the current surface mask data for the surface from the terrain. </li>
    <li>Modify the surface mask data in the buffer and update the sum mask data buffer.
    </li>
    <li>Push the surface mask information back to the terrain. </li>
    <li>Force an update of the terrain's textures. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Note: All surface mask painting operations occur in the context of a single surface
    at a time. To paint multiple surfaces at once, follow steps 1 through 4 for each
    surface, then execute step 5 once.</p>
  <h3>
    Step 1
  </h3>
  <p>
    Similar to the first step when deforming the heightmap of the terrain, surface mask
    painting first requires the user to fetch the set of data that exists on the terrain.
    This is done using one of the following functions:</p>
    
<pre>bool NiTerrain::GetSurfaceMask(const NiSurface* pkSurface, 
    NiRect&lt;efd::SInt32&gt; kTerrainSpaceRegion, SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkMaskBuffer, 
    SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkMaskSumBuffer = NULL, NiTerrainDataSnapshot* pkSnapshot = NULL);

bool NiTerrain::GetSurfaceMask(efd::SInt32 uiSurfaceIndex, 
    NiRect&lt;efd::SInt32&gt; kTerrainSpaceRegion, SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkMaskBuffer, 
    SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkMaskSumBuffer = NULL, NiTerrainDataSnapshot* pkSnapshot = NULL);</pre>
  <p>
    Note: These functions are functionally identical except for the first parameter
    that they take. The second function simply takes the terrain wide surface index
    of the surface being queried. The surface index of a particular surface can be queried
    from the terrain object via a call to the following function:</p>
    
<pre>NiInt32 NiTerrain::GetSurfaceIndex(const NiSurface* pkSurface);</pre>
  <p>
    Once again, the function takes a terrain space region to describe the region of
    data to be fetched from the terrain. Like the heightmap functions, this terrain
    space region is specified in terms of verticies on the terrain, however, the surface
    mask pixels rarely directly line up with the verticies of the terrain, in this case,
    the region is expanded to include any partial pixels that the region overlaps. The
    following diagram illustrates how the region is expanded to include the partially
    covered pixels.</p>
  <div class="FigureContainer">
    <img alt="Partly covered pixels" src="images/partlycoveredpixels.png">
    <p class="FigureCaption">
      Diagram: <i>Partly covered pixels</i></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    In the above diagram, a Multi-sector 8x8 terrain is depicted. In the diagram sector
    [0,0] is in the bottom left corner, the intersection of each blue line is the location
    of a vertex, the terrain space index of each vertex is determined by the numbers
    allong the axis of the diagram, the red dashed lines represent the borders of sectors,
    the green dashed lines represent the borders of the pixels in the blend mask of
    the terrain, the shaded yellow area represents the region of the terrain we wish
    to fetch the data for, and the shaded red area shows how that region is extended
    to include partially covered pixels.</p>
  <p>
    The 'terrain space region' for the shaded area in the diagram would be defined by
    the following rectangle object:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>kTerrainSpaceRegion.m_left = 4 </li>
    <li>kTerrainSpaceRegion.m_bottom = 4 </li>
    <li>kTerrainSpaceRegion.m_right = 10 </li>
    <li>kTerrainSpaceRegion.m_top = 12 </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Due to the expansion of the region to cover the overlapped pixels, the user could
    expect the buffer to contain a 9x12 buffer of surface mask pixels for the surface.<br />
    Note: If the surface being queried does not exist at the pixels being queried (the
    underlying leafs may not contain the surface) then the returned pixel values will
    be 0.</p>
  <p>
    The main other difference to the heightmap defomation process in this step is the
    inclusion of a second buffer object in the function call. This parameter is the
    pkMaskSumBuffer object. Whilst this object is optional, it is recommended to retrieve
    at least one copy of the mask sum buffer when painting the surface mask buffer as
    it will help in painting algorithms. This buffer will be the same size as the mask
    buffer, but will instead contain the sum of all the mask values of all the surfaces
    at that pixel. A value of 0 represents no surfaces affecting that pixel, and a value
    of 255 indicates that the pixel is completely painted.</p>
  <p>
    The following code demonstates the execution of this step:</p>
    
  <pre>NiRect&lt;NiInt32&gt; kRegion;
kRegion.m_left = 4;
kRegion.m_right = 10; 
kRegion.m_top = 12;
kRegion.m_bottom = 4;
      
SurfaceMaskBuffer buffer;<br>
SurfaceMaskBuffer sumBuffer;
NiTerrain* pkTerrain = GetTerrain();
pkTerrain-&gt;GetSurfaceMask(pkSurface, kRegion, &amp;buffer, &amp;sumBuffer;</pre>

  <h3>
    Step 2
  </h3>
  <p>
    In this step the user must modify the buffers to acheive the desired painting outcome.
    The user should modify the mask buffer to contain the values the surface mask should
    have and the sum mask buffer should be adjusted according to how the adjustment
    of the mask should be acheived. The sum buffer is used to determine how the changes
    to the surface mask will affect the other surfaces that are also painted upon the
    same pixels. The following examples demonstrate how the sum mask buffer can be changed
    to acheive different results.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Set the sum mask buffer to a lower value </li>
    <ul>
      <li>All surfaces on the terrain in those areas will be gradually unpainted from the
        surface </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Set the sum mask buffer to a higher value </li>
    <ul>
      <li>All surfaces on the terrain in those areas will be gradually increased in strength
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Increase the sum mask buffer by the same amount that the surface mask buffer is
      increased by </li>
    <ul>
      <li>The surface will increase in strength in the area </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Keep the sum mask buffer constant whilst increasing the surface mask buffer
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>The surface will increase in strength and decrease the other surface's strengths
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The following code demonstrates a simple painting algorithm and implements a hybrid
    of the last two techniques listed above:</p>
    
<pre>efd::UInt8* pMaskData = buffer.GetBuffer();
efd::UInt8* pMaskSumData = sumBuffer.GetBuffer();
for (efd::UInt32 uiIndex = 0; uiIndex &lt; pMaskBuffer-&gt;GetSize(); ++uiIndex)
{
    efd::UInt8 uiOldValue = pMaskData[uiIndex];
    efd::UInt8 uiNewValue = efd::Clamp(uiOldValue + 10, 0, 255);
 
    efd::UInt8 uiOldSum = pMaskSumData[uiIndex];
    efd::UInt8 uiNewSum = efd::Clamp(uiOldSum - uiOldValue + uiNewValue, 0, 255);

    pMaskData[uiIndex] = uiNewValue;
    pMaskSumData[uiIndex] = uiNewSum;
 }</pre>
  <h3>
    Step 3
  </h3>
  <p>
    Once the surface mask has been modified appropriately, the data must be sent back
    to the terrain object. This is done by executing the following code:</p>
    
  <pre>pkTerrain-&gt;SetSurfaceMask(pkSurface, &amp;buffer, &amp;sumBuffer);</pre>
  <p>
    By calling this function, the data stored in the buffer is sent out to the various
    related textures to create the rendered effect of changing the blend mask. It is
    worth noting, that by calling this function, the terrain object will attempt to
    add the specified surface to the relevant leafs in the area, if the surface cannot
    be added to a leaf (because the leaf cannot accomodate another surface) then the
    data from that region of the buffer will be ignored. It is also worth noting that
    if the surface mask for a surface on a particular leaf becomes completely blank,
    then that surface will be removed from the leaf automatically to make room for other
    surfaces to be painted in its place.</p>
  <h3>
    Step 4
  </h3>
  <p>
    The final step when painting surface masks is to update the low detail textures
    of the terrain so they match the result of using the new blend mask, and send an
    update pass through the terrain to ensure all the texturing data is up to date after
    the paint operation has finished. This step is executed using the following code:</p>
    
<pre>pkTerrain-&gt;RenderLowDetailTextures();
pkTerrain-&gt;Update(0.0f);</pre>
  <p>
    Note: When painting multiple surface masks at once, this step only needs to be performed
    once.</p>
  <h2>
    Data Snapshots
  </h2>
  <p>
    Data snapshots are used as a mechanism to store the current state of the terrain,
    generally before it has been painted and changed. The main application for this
    information is to store the state of the terrain at the beginning of painting actions
    efficiently, so that that state may be restored at a later point in time, such as
    required by an undo/redo system.</p>
  <p>
    The main functions relevant to data snapshots are:</p>
    
<pre>bool NiTerrain::GetHeightMap(NiRect&lt;efd::SInt32&gt; kTerrainSpaceRegion, 
    HeightMapBuffer* pkBuffer, NiTerrainDataSnapshot* pkSnapshot = NULL);

bool NiTerrain::GetSurfaceMask(const NiSurface* pkSurface, 
    NiRect&lt;efd::SInt32&gt; kTerrainSpaceRegion, SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkMaskBuffer, 
    SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkMaskSumBuffer = NULL, NiTerrainDataSnapshot* pkSnapshot = NULL);
      <br>
bool NiTerrain::GetSurfaceMask(efd::SInt32 uiSurfaceIndex, 
    NiRect&lt;efd::SInt32&gt; kTerrainSpaceRegion, SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkMaskBuffer, 
    SurfaceMaskBuffer* pkMaskSumBuffer = NULL, NiTerrainDataSnapshot* pkSnapshot = NULL);</pre>
  <p>
    Each of these functions may be given a data snapshot object as its last parameter,
    when supplied to the function, the snapshot will be queried to check if data for
    the selected region has already been stored, if the data already exists within the
    snapshot, it will not be modified. If the data does not already exist, then it will
    be added.</p>
  <p>
    In the event that the user then wishes to restore the state of the terrain stored
    in the snapshot, the following function may be called:</p>
    
  <pre>void RestoreDataSnapshot(NiTerrainDataSnapshot* pkSnapshot);</pre>
  <p>
    This will then restore the terrain to the stored state.<br>
    Note: If the snapshot contains surface mask data, then step 4 of the surface mask
    painting process must be executed after calling this function.</p>
  <h2>
    Painting Across Multiple Sectors
  </h2>
  <p>
    Whilst the painting system abstracts away a lot of the concerns involved in painting
    across multiple sectors. The following set of guidelines should always be followed
    when painting:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When painting or deforming terrain on the edge of sectors, make sure the adjacent
      sector is loaded as well. </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Data is replicated across the seams of sectors, without the adjacent sectors loaded
        when the painting actions are made seams and cracks may appear between the sectors.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Be sure to save all the relevant sectors to disk once your changes are complete
      or they will not persist and may cause cracks and seams at a later time. </li>
    <li>The row of pixels on the very edge of a sector in the surface mask are replicated
      to the sector adjacent to the row. Be sure to have the adjacent sector loaded when
      modifying these pixels. </li>
  </ul>
