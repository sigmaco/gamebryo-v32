<h1>NiTerrain Paging System</h1>

  <p>The terrain paging system refers to the automatic process of loading and unloading sectors of 
  terrain according to some predefined algorithm. This algorithm may simply be a selection set of 
  sectors to load to full detail, or perhaps a more complicated process determined by a reference 
  camera's distance to a sector.</p>
  
  <p>This system is implemented through the definition of a 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainSectorSelector.htm">NiTerrainSectorSelector</a></span> object. Each 
  instance of a <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrain.htm">NiTerrain</a></span> must have an implementation of this class assigned to it, and by default, 
  the terrain will use the <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainSectorSelectorDefault.htm">NiTerrainSectorSelectorDefault</a></span> implementation. Sector selectors are 
  responsible for creating a selection set of sectors and generating a list of 'page' commands for 
  the terrain streaming to execute.</p>
  <h2>
    Configuring the sector selectors
  </h2>
  <p>This release of the terrain engine supplies two implementations of 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSectorSelector</span>. 
  These implementations are; the default sector selector, and the paging sector selector. These 
  implementations are intended as reference implementations and provide very basic functionality 
  with little features.</p>
  
  <p>Configuration of a sector selector object involves assigning the selector object to the terrain 
  through code like the following:</p>
  
  <pre>NiCamera* pkCamera = GetPagingReferenceCamera();
NiTerrain* pkTerrain = GetTerrain();
NiTerrainSectorSelector* pkTerrainPager = NiNew NiTerrainSectorPager(pkTerrain , pkCamera);
pkTerrain-&gt;SetSectorSelector(pkTerrainPager);</pre>
  
  <p>Like other configurable points on the terrain object, the sector selector object should be 
  applied to the terrain before loading begins.</p>
  <h2>
    The default sector selector
  </h2>
  <p>The default sector selector provides a very basic sector selector implementation. The default 
  operation of this selector is to simply load a 2D range of sectors, starting with sector [0,0] and 
  extending 1 sector in each direction. This will cause only sector [0,0] of a terrain asset to load 
  automatically when the scene is loaded. All sectors within the configured range are loaded to 
  their maximum level of detail.</p>
  
  <p>Both the starting sector, and the range of sectors to load are configurable through the class 
  interface. See the class reference for details on how to configure this selector further.</p>
  
  <p>This sector selector is appropriate for simple terrains within a scene that do not require 
  dynamic loading/unloading.</p>
  <h2>
    The paging sector selector
  </h2>
  <p>The paging sector selector provides a basic implementation of automatically loading sectors 
  based upon the current location of a camera object. Sectors within a range around the camera are 
  considered for loading, the closest sectors are loaded to the highest level of detail, whilst
   sectors surrounding those are loaded to progressively lower levels of detail. As the camera moves 
   around the scene, sectors are automatically streamed in and out of memory providing the 
   appearance of a seamless landscape.</p>
  
  <p>Please see <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainSectorSelector.htm">
    NiTerrainSectorSeletor</a></span> class reference for details on how to configure this selector.</p>
  
  <p>This sector selector is intended as an example implementation of what the sector selector 
  system is capable of achieving, though it has not been highly tested, nor does it provide a fully 
  featured configurable interface. It is recommended that this selector not be used in a released 
  application, but developers are encouraged to take inspiration from it and extend it to their own 
  purposes.</p>
  <h2>
    Extending the paging system
  </h2>
  <p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSectorSelector</span> class's algorithm revolves around a single virtual function 
  "UpdateSectorSelection". This function is called every time the terrain object is updated 
  (generally once every frame). Generally, this function would calculate which sectors should be 
  loaded at the present time, and add them to the selection by calling the function "AddToSelection" 
  with the appropriate arguments.</p>
  
  <p>The base sector selector class implements functionality to check if that sector is a valid 
  selection (check to see if it is on disk) and that it hasn't already been requested to load to the 
  requested level of detail.</p>
  
  <p>The terrain's interaction with the sector selector every frame is illustrated in the following 
  diagram.</p>
  
  <div class="FigureContainer">
    <img alt="NiTerrainSectorSelector" src="images/NiTerrainSectorSelector.png">
    <p class="FigureCaption">Diagram: <i>NiTerrainSectorSelector Interaction</i></p>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    Each frame, the terrain requests the selector to update its selection. It then fetches the 
    selection (note: because of the internals of AddToSelection, only the changed sectors will be 
    returned in the call to GetSelectedSectors). The terrain then clears this selection set. If for 
    any reason the terrain could not begin processing a request, it will resubmit it to the selector 
    so that it may be returned and requested in the next frame. A common reason for a request not 
    being able to be executed at the current frame could be that the sector is already processing a 
    previous request and is unable to abort it.
  </p>

  <p>
    ***When extending the paging system, please consider the limitations described in the section on 
    Multi-sector terrain, and design your algorithms appropriately.
