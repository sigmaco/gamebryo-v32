<h1>Overview of the Terrain Hierarchy</h1>
  <p>The terrain is an extension to Gamebryo's <a href=../General_Topics/Scene_Graph_Basics.htm 
  title="Scene Graph system">Scene Graph system</a>. Terrain is created and rendered by adding a 
  <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrain.htm" class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrain</a> object to the scene graph of an 
  application. The creation of an <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrain.htm" 
      class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrain</a> 
  object can be assisted using the Game Framework block document system by adding an entity with a 
  Terrain model mix-in to the scene.</p>

  <h2>Class hierarchy</h2>
  
  <p>The terrain library is split across several main classes; 
  <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrain.htm" class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrain</a>, 
  <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainSector.htm" class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSector</a>, and 
  <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainCell.htm" class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainCell</a>. Each class is used to 
  manage a different level of the terrain details. 
  <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrain.htm" class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrain</a> is the parent class to all other 
  classes, and represents an entire terrain within a scene. 
  <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainSector.htm" class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSector</a> represents a square 
  region of the terrain, each sector can be streamed in and out of memory from disk simultaneously 
  allowing for paging of multi-sector terrains. The 
  <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainCell.htm" class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainCell</a> class handles the geometry 
  of small sections of terrain, its level of detail functionality, and the final appearance of the 
  terrain through the renderer by managing 
  <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiSurface.htm" class="NDLSystemFont">NiSurface</a> objects.</p>
   
  <p>The following diagram describes the relationship between these main classes:</p>

    <p class="FigureCaption">Diagram: <i>Class relationship diagram</i></p>
</div>
  
  <p>As the terrain is an extension of the scene graph system, it is useful to identify the main 
  components in the terrain's extension. The following diagram illustrates a basic inheritance 
  hierarchy of the main classes involved in terrain.</p>
  
<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img alt="Class inheritance hierarchy" src="images/NiTerrainInheirance.png">
    <p class="FigureCaption">Diagram: <i>Class inheritance hierarchy</i></p>
</div>

  <p>The terrain data structure is organized into a list of sectors, where each sector contains a 
  quadtree structure of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainCells</span> to describe the terrain in that area. The quadtreestructure
  allows for fast culling and intersection queries whilst managing the level of detail that is shown
  in the distance. The following diagram illustrates an example of the state of a typical terrain 
  data structure, and hence, the underlying scene graph structure.</p>

  <h3>NiTerrain</h3>
  
  <p>The <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrain.htm" class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrain</a> object is used to set up 
  the general parameters for the terrain instance, including the number of LOD and the block size of 
  each block. These parameters define the size of a single terrain sector. The 
  <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrain.htm" class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrain</a> organizes the display of its 
  contained sectors and manages 
  the stitching of borders between sectors.</p>
  
  <h3>NiTerrainSector</h3>
  
  <p>The <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainSector.htm" 
      class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainSector</a> object manages 
  the geometry and material information of a section of terrain. It represents the head of the 
  internal quadtree of geometry cells. It is responsible for loading data from disk, performing ray 
  intersections, transforming the terrain geometry, and managing internal resources (such as shared 
  vertex streams and shaders). The terrain sector is also responsible for performing level of detail 
  calculation and selecting which cells to display each frame.</p>
  
  <h3>NiTerrainCell</h3>
  
  <p>As stated above, the terrain sector contains a quad-tree of cells. Each cell contains the 
  actual geometry of the terrain. There are several levels in this balanced tree, each one becoming 
  of progressively higher detail.</p>
  
  <p>The number of levels of subdivision is an option that can be configured in the parent terrain, 
  as is the side length of each cell. The side length is the number of voxels (triangle pairs) along 
  a given side for the cell. (16, 32, 64, etc.). The cell side length <b>must</b> be a power of 2.</p>
  
  <p>Levels of detail are numbered from the top down; the lowest level of detail (the top of the 
  tree) is called level 0. The highest level of detail (the bottom of the tree) is called level N, 
  where N is the total number of subdivisions of detail. When there are N lower levels of detail
  specified in the terrain, there are actually N+1 total levels, since level 0 is always present.</p>
  
  <p>The top of the quad-tree (level 0) is represented by a single cell that covers the entire area 
  of the sector. Since the number of vertices per cell is always the same, independent of the level 
  of the cell, the spacing between each vertex will be very large. The next level from this (level 
  1) will split the top cell into 4 more cells, which effectively doubles the number of vertices 
  along each side of the sector. This subdivision occurs all the way down to level N, which is the 
  level of maximum detail. The following diagram is an illustration of the subdivision of cells for
  different levels of detail, each square represents one cell in the tree.</p>
    
  <div class="FigureContainer">
    <img alt="Terrain quadtree architecture" src="images/NiTerrainQuadTree.png">
    <p class="FigureCaption">Diagram: <i>Terrain quadtree architecture</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>There are two different types of cells. The 
  <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainCellNode.htm" class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainCellNode</a> is a cell that has 
  4 children (the cells on level 0 all the way to level N &#8211; 1). It contains geometry data as 
  well as two low resolution textures to display the terrain&#8217;s diffuse color and normal map. 
  The <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainCellLeaf.htm" 
      class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainCellLeaf</a> can only be 
  found on level N. They do not have any children. Those cells hold the blending information as well 
  as the materials used on that specific leaf. A leaf can hold up to 4 different materials.</p>
  
  <h2>Material Layers</h2>
  
  <p>The appearance of the terrain is governed by surfaces. A specific material's configuration is 
  managed by a <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiSurface.htm" 
      class="NDLSystemFont">NiSurface</a> object. This class maintains information about the material's meta data and 
  what textures should be used for the various maps a material can have. Further details on material 
  configuration can be found in the documentation on 
  <a href="NiTerrain_Materials_and_Masks.htm">Materials</a>.</p>
  
  <p>As mentioned above, each 
    <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainCellLeaf.htm" class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainCellLeaf</a> supports a blend mask. The terrain however holds a 
  list of all the surfaces that are used. This information is now stored in the root.terrain file 
  and the sector mask data is stored in the sector .dof files. When rendering, all materials are 
  blended together based on the weight found in the associated channel in the leaf's blend mask.</p>
