  <h1>
    NiTerrain Streaming</h1>
  <p>
    The terrain engine loads data from a disk using an internal multithreaded streaming
    system. This section of the documentation provides a basic outline on how this system
    works.<br>
  </p>
  <h2>
    How Streaming works
  </h2>
  <p>
    The streaming system is broken up into tasks. Each task represents a job to perform
    upon a specific sector within a terrain. Only one task may be executing for a particular
    sector at a time.</p>
  <p>
    Tasks are submitted to the terrain streaming manager. The manager then initializes
    the streaming pipeline to execute the task. Each task goes through a series of stages
    of execution depending upon what type of task it is.</p>
  <p>
    The types of tasks and the stages they go through are listed in the following table.
    A few stages have special restrictions on their execution, these are also listed
    in the table below.</p>

  <p>
    Transitions between different stages in the pipeline may be reported to a listener
    object if required.</p>
  <p>
    Once a task has completed going through all the stages of its execution it is considered
    complete, removed from the streaming manager, and its resources are freed for the
    next task to begin execution.</p>
  <h2>
    Monitoring Streaming
  </h2>
  <p>
    Whilst the streaming system does not support an explicit method of querying the
    progress of the streaming tasks, the following set of functions allow an application
    to detect various states that the streaming system is in.</p>
  <h3 class="NDLSystemFont">
    void NiTerrainStreamingManager::WaitForAllTasksCompleted();
  </h3>
  <p>
    Use this function to pause the calling thread until the streaming system becomes
    idle.</p>
  <h3 class="NDLSystemFont">
    bool NiTerrainStreamingManager::PollSectorStreamingStatus(NiTerrainSector* pkSector);
  </h3>
  <p>
    Use this function to query if the streaming system is currently operating upon a
    particular sector object.</p>
  <h3 class="NDLSystemFont">
    bool NiTerrainStreamingManager::PollStreamingStatus();
  </h3>
  <p>
    Use this function to query if the streaming system is currently active and executing
    any tasks.</p>
  <h3 class="NDLSystemFont">
    Listener* NiTerrainStreamingManager::SetListener(Listener* pkListener);
  </h3>
  <p>
    This function can be used to setup a listener object to listen to further events
    during the execution of individual tasks in the system. Further information on configuring
    this functionality can be found in the next section under 'setting listeners'.</p>
  <h2>
    Configuring the Streaming
  </h2>
  <p>
    Whilst the streaming system is fairly closed from the developer, there are a few
    points through which the execution of the streaming can be customized and monitored.
    The following sections each outline one of these extension points.<br>
  </p>
  <h3>
    Setting Listeners
  </h3>
  <p>
    The streaming system supports a listener object to allow reporting and expose loading
    events to the application.</p>
  <p>
    Events that are trackable on the streaming manager include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tasks beginning execution. </li>
    <li>Tasks progressing through the individual stages of execution. </li>
    <li>Tasks finishing execution. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In order to set the system to use a specific streaming listener object, code similar
    to the following may be used:</p>
    
<pre>NiTerrain* pkTerrain = GetTerrain();
NiTerrainStreamingPerformanceListener* pkListener = EE_NEW NiTerrainStreamingPerformanceListener(
    "TerrainPerformanceData.csv");
pkTerrain-&gt;GetStreamingManager()-&gt;SetListener(pkListener);</pre>
  <p>
    When developing a resource listener, it is important to recognize that the streaming
    manager operates in a multithreaded environment. Developers should be aware of the
    caveats in multithreaded environments and take necessary precautions in the development
    of their listener object to avoid corruption of their application. Developers should
    also take notice that the listener object implements the NiPointer interface virtually,
    and as a result, the IncRefCount and DecRefCount must be implemented manually, or
    explicitly referred to a NiRefObject implementation.</p>
  <p>
    Please refer to <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainStreamingManager.htm">
    NiTerrainStreamingManager</a></span> class reference documentation for further information on the
    listener interface.</p>
  <h3>
    Setting the Number of Threads
  </h3>
  <p>
    The streaming manager is a threaded environment and uses a pool of threads to execute
    the streaming tasks that are requested. The size of this thread pool may be configured
    externally, and can be done through the following code:</p>
    
  <pre>NiTerrain* pkTerrain = GetTerrain();
pkTerrain-&gt;GetStreamingManager()-&gt;SetNumWorkers(8);</pre>
  <p>
    It is worth noting, that by setting the number of workers to 0, all the threaded
    features of the streaming system are disabled, and the process of loading from disk
    becomes synchronous.</p>
  <p>
    The default number of workers for the streaming system is 8.</p>
  <h3>
    Configuring Different Storage Methods
  </h3>
  <p>
    The terrain storage system is quite flexible in what it allows the developer to 
    customize in terms of file format, and loading data alongside the terrain. 
    Please refer to <a href="NiTerrain_Storage.htm">Terrain Storage</a> for more information.</p>
  <h3>
    Configuring Automatic Streaming of Sectors
  </h3>
  <p>
    The terrain engine supports a &quot;sector selector&quot; object for the implementation of 
    an algorithm that automatically selects which sectors should be loaded, when and 
    to what level of detail. Please refer to <a href="NiTerrain_Paging.htm">Terrain 
    Paging</a> for more information.</p>
