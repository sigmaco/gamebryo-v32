  <h1>
    Querying the Terrain Using Ray-Casting</h1>
  <p>
    The preferred method for querying information from a terrain is through the use
    of rays. A ray is a vector extending towards infinity. In order to perform ray casting
    against the terrain, an <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiRay.htm">NiRay</a></span> object is first created, and its direction, origin
    and maximum length are defined.
  </p>
<pre>
NiPoint3 kRayStart = NiPoint3(0, 0, FLT_MAX);
NiPoint3 kRayDirection = NiPoint3(0.0f, 0.0f, -1.0f);
float fMaxLength = FLT_MAX;
NiRay kRay = NiRay(kRayStart, kRayDirection, fMaxLength);
</pre>
  <p>
    The above code demonstrates the creation of a ray that will be used within the terrain
    to project downward along the Z axis at (x, y) = (0, 0). There are several different
    ways that a ray can be used with the terrain, each is detailed in the following
    sections. In all cases, it is assumed that a pointer to the terrain object we wish
    to test against has been obtained and a ray similar to the one created above is
    being used.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Testing for Collisions
  </h2>
  <p>
    To find out if a given ray collides with the terrain at any point, but the actual
    point of intersection is not required, use the "Test" function.
  </p>
<pre>
bool bCollided = pkTerrain-&gt;Test(kRay);
</pre>
  <h2>
    Finding Point of Intersection With Terrain
  </h2>
  <p>
    An ideal use of a ray on the terrain is to find a point of intersection, for example
    to discover where a projectile fired from a player will collide, the selected ray
    should be passed as a parameter to the interactor's Collide function as shown below.
    This method simply finds the closest point of intersection between the given ray
    and the terrain, and returns both the point of collision, and the surface normal
    at that point.</p>
<pre>
// Collide our ray with the terrain
bool bCollided = pkTerrain-&gt;Collide(kRay);
</pre>
  <p>
    This function returns true if there was a collision. In order to retrieve further
    details on the intersection, use the "GetIntersection" method</p>
<pre>
// Get some details of the collision from the ray
NiPoint3 kCollisionPoint;
NiPoint3 kCollisionNormal;
kRay.GetIntersection(kCollisionPoint, kCollisionNormal);
</pre>
  <p>
    An example use case for the aforementioned form of ray collision would be forcing
    an object to follow the surface of the terrain. Casting a vertical ray from the
    current object's position downward will give the point of collision with the terrain,
    which can then be assigned to the objects 'z' position. A demonstration of this
    particular method can be found in Toolbench, when the "Snap Selection To Terrain"
    menu item is selected.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Terrain Material Queries
  </h2>
  <p>
    Ray collision may also be used to discover the blend value of a given material at
    a point on the terrain. For example, you could ask the terrain how visible the 'Grass'
    material is at a given point. The blend value returned will be a number ranging
    from 0 to 255, with 255 corresponding to 100% visibility.
  </p>
<pre>
NiSurface* pkSurface = GetSurface("Grass");

// Collide our ray with the terrain and find the opacity of pkSurface at that point
NiUInt8 ucOpacity;
bool bCollided = pkTerrain-&gt;GetSurfaceOpacity(kRay, pkSurface, ucOpacity);
</pre>
  <h2>
    Meta Data Queries
  </h2>
  <p>
    Surface meta data can also be queried using the ray casting system. More details
    on this can be found in the documentation on 
    <a href="Querying_Terrain_Metadata.htm">Querying Terrain Metadata</a>.<br>
  </p>
  <h2>
    Usage Notes
  </h2>
  <p>
    The terrain handles ray intersections differently depending on the direction of
    the ray. If a ray direction is on the same axis as the terrain up vector (such as
    in the code above), then the terrain is able to perform a direct lookup for intersection
    which is reasonably efficient and fast.</p>
  <p>
    In other cases, the terrain must check actual triangles against the ray. While attempts
    are made to optimize this (only checking relevant blocks, 'intelligent guessing'
    which triangles to test), it should be regarded as an expensive routine. The worst
    case is a ray that is parallel to the surface of the terrain, as this can end up
    testing a very large number of triangles.</p>
  <p>
    For this reason, it is preferable to use rays whose direction is perpendicular to
    the terrain where possible. For complex collisions and interactions with the terrain
    it is suggested to use the

    functionality.
