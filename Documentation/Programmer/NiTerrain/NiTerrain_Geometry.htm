<h1>NiTerrain Geometry</h1>

  <p>The terrain engine stores its data in a quadtree format to allow fast culling and level of 
  detail. When rendering the scene, each cell is checked for its visibility and distance to the 
  camera. Cells that are closer to the camera are allowed to subdivide to their higher detail 
  representations whilst distant cells are forced to render at low detail.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Because of the nature of the sub division, terrain sizes are limited to powers of two, further, 
  because cells are stitched with bordering cells, each cell be represented by a square array of 
  vertices with dimensions that satisfy the following equation:
  </p>
  
  <div class="FigureContainer">
    <p><img alt="dimension 2^x + 1" src="images/EXTERN_0000.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where x is any 
    positive integer</p>
  </div>
  <p>Note that there is duplication of vertex information on the border of cells to allow a seamless 
  terrain system to be rendered.<br>
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>
    Tessellation
  </h3>
  <p>The basic tessellation of the terrain occurs in patches of triangles arranged by alternating 
  the triangle subdivision of a quad between 4 verts of the terrain. The following diagram 
  illustrates the basic approach to tessellation of the terrain's height field.</p>
  
  <div class="FigureContainer">
    <img alt="Basic tesselation of an 8x8 terrain" src="images/Tessellation8x8.png">
    <p class="FigureCaption">Figure 1: <i>Basic tesselation of an 8x8 terrain</i></p>
  </div>
  
  <p>Each cell in the terrain is represented by a mesh similar to the above image, cells are 
  spatially placed beside each other to form a progressively larger patch of terrain. Cells may 
  however be drawn at different levels of detail. Because of this, a method of stitching the seams 
  between cells must be employed to prevent cracks from appearing. The engine automatically stitches 
  the seams of cells of differing levels of detail by removing every second vertex along the 
  relevant border on the higher detail cell. The following diagram illustrates this method, with red 
  outlines used to highlight the bounding area of individual cells.</p>
  <div class="FigureContainer">
    <img alt="Stitching of borders" src="images/borderstitching.png">
    <p class="FigureCaption">Figure 2: <i>Stitching of borders</i></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    These changes in the tessellation are applied by the terrain engine by swapping around the 
    current index stream on each cell for a particular situation allowing it to merge pairs of 
    triangles along the edge of a seam between two cells of differing LoD.
  </p>
  <h3>Morphing</h3>
  <p>The terrain engine supports geometry morphing as the user's camera navigates through the scene. 
  Instead of higher detailed terrain patches popping in instantaneously, the geometry of those 
  patches are gradually morphed to higher detail as the user gets closer to that patch.</p>
  
  <p>Customizations to the morphing system may be made through a few functions on the 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrain.htm">NiTerrain</a></span> 
  object. These customizations must be applied at runtime to the object and are not stored as a part 
  of a particular terrain's asset. Customization of these values may allow the developer to tweak 
  the terrain detail levels for different systems at runtime. The following functions are available 
  to tweak the parameters of the morphing algorithm:</p>
  
  <pre>bool SetLODMode(NiUInt32 uiLODMode);</pre>
  
  <p>This function allows the developer to select different morphing modes and even disable the 
  system entirely. The following table describes the different modes available, and their operation.

<pre>void SetLODScale(float fScale);</pre>
  
  <p>This function allows the developer to adjust the overall detail level of the terrain. A scale 
  value of 1.0 results in the default level of detail for the terrain. Lower values will cause the 
  terrain's detail to decrease proportionally and higher values will cause the terrain's detail to 
  increase exponentially. For example, a value of 0.5 will cause the terrain to render only half of 
  its LOD's, and a value of 2.0 will cause the radius of high detail geometry to double.</p>
  
  <h3>Stream usage</h3>
  
  <p>Each cell in the terrain quadtree stores data for a mesh to represent that cell in the scene. 
  This data is stored in standard Gamebryo GPU streams, and includes positional and lighting 
  information.</p>

  <p>The optional entries in the streams are dependent upon the terrain configuration, and if a

  <h3>
    Useful calculations
  </h3>
  <p>
    This section contains a number of standard calculations that can be performed to calculate 
    various properties of the terrain. The intent in this section is to highlight the various 
    mathematical relationships between the parameters of the terrain. In each of the calculations, 
    the following variables may be used:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <i>LOD </i>- The number of subdivided levels of detail that the terrain stores.
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>CellSize </i>- The width of a cell in terrain space.
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>CellSizeInVerts </i>- The number of verts stored on a cell's mesh.
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>SectorSize </i>- The width of a sector in terrain space.
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>SectorSizeInVerts </i>- The number of verts stored on a sector's high detail mesh.
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>NumberOfCells </i>- The total number of cells stored in a sector
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>NumberOfHighDetailCells </i>- The number of high detail cells stored on a sector<br>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>
    How to choose the best geometry format
  </h2>
  <p>One of the difficult decisions to make when first setting up a new terrain scene is what 
  geometry configuration to use. The difficulty lies in the fact that once the format has been 
  selected, it cannot be easily changed again without losing the material painting data.</p>
  
  <p>Considerations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      How much detail should be shown in the distance?
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In general, a smaller cell size reduces the view distance, whilst increasing the number of 
        levels of detail. This allows higher concentrations of detail in the foreground of the 
        scene, at the expense of vertex shader load, increased draw calls, higher memory footprint 
        and slower streaming.
      </li>
      <li>
        A larger number of levels of detail will mean distant geometry can be rendered in less 
        triangles (potential performance increase).
      </li>
      <li>
        A larger number of levels of detail will mean more individual meshes to render, and hence 
        more draw calls involved in rendering. This may be a cause for degraded performance.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      How many materials need to be painted upon the terrain in an area?
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each cell on the terrain can support 4 materials. More cells will mean each sector can have 
        more materials, though again, this is subject to potential performance degradation due to 
        draw calls.
      </li>
      <li>
        A smaller cell size will allow a higher concentration of materials in an area, however, will 
        also increase the load on the vertex shader, and reduce the efficiency of the blend masks.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is worth noting that whilst each cell can potentially support 4 unique materials, in 
        order to paint across the border of cells and achieve a smooth blending of the materials, 
        the material being painted must exist on the adjacent cell as well.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Recommendations:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Experiment with the geometry first to get an understanding for the detail that can be 
      achieved, and the performance in those scenes.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Note, the performance will vary greatly with the number of materials you use on the terrain. 
        When testing, paint a simple number of surfaces on the terrain to get an accurate idea of 
        the performance.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use each vertex of the terrain to represent 0.5m of game units, then use normal and parallax 
      maps to increase detail in the foreground.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Using more than 4 levels of detail on a terrain begins to reduce performance rapidly. Try to 
      keep this value below 5.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Sectors of size 512x512 perform quite well, consider using a multiple sector approach to 
      represent larger terrains.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Before spending a lot of time perfecting the painting of materials on the terrain, make sure 
      you are happy with the performance under the current configuration. As mentioned before, it is 
      currently impossible to migrate a terrain to a different format once it has been created 
      without losing some information.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
