<h1>NiTerrain Resource Management</h1>
  <h2>
    Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
    The terrain engine routes the allocation of most of its key resources through a
    single <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainResourceManager.htm">NiTerrainResourceManager</a></span> object. Each NiTerrain object owns a single resource
    manager object derived from NiTerrainResourceManager. This class provides the following
    resource allocation services to the terrain class:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Allocation of Textures </li>
    <li>Allocation of Streams </li>
    <li>Allocation of common size buffers </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The default resource manager is implemented in <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/NiTerrainStandardResourceManager.htm">NiTerrainStandardResourceManager</a></span>.
    This class provides a simple implementation that generates the required resources
    when requested, releases them and tracks them. It does not support pooling of GPU
    resources, though it does support pooling of the standard size buffers the terrain
    object allocates during streaming.</p>
  <h2>
    Configuring a Custom Resource Manager
  </h2>
  <p>
    In some applications it may prove useful to take control of the allocation of the
    terrain's resources, or track them in a specific way. In this case, a developer
    may design their own resource manager to interact with the terrain engine. One possible
    customization of the system may implement GPU resource pooling to improve the performance
    of large scale paging terrains.</p>
  <p>
    Custom resource managers are expected to implement the interface provided by 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainResourceManager</span>. Developers can use 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrainStandardResourceManager</span> (recommended) 
    as a reference implementation or even derive from the standard resource manager directly, as the
    standard resource manager allocates the correct types and configuration of resources
    for the correct queries.</p>
  <p>
    Some key guidelines to remember when implementing a resource manager:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The resource manager operates in a multi-threaded environment. </li>
    <li>Each instance of a resource manager is exclusive to a particular terrain object.</li>
    <li>Resource managers should be assigned to terrain objects before the terrain allocates
      any resources. Generally this means before a 'load' function is called. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Custom resource managers may be specified using the following interface documented in the class reference:</p>
<pre>NiTerrain* pkTerrain = GetTerrain();
pkTerrain-&gt;SetResourceManager(EE_NEW </span>NiTerrainStandardResourceManager();</pre>

  <h2>
    Configuring a Resource Listener
  </h2>
  <p>One useful feature of the terrain resource manager system is the ability to provide a listener object to the resource manager to allow an external object to hook into allocation events and potentially provide logging of resource allocations, reporting and/or trigger events within the application.</p>
  
  <p>Events that are trackable on the resource manager include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Allocate/Release events for all resource types (textures, streams, buffers)</li>
    <li>Creation/Destruction events for the underlying objects (when they are removed
      from the pools). </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In order to set the terrain system to use a specific resource listener object, code
    similar to the following may be used:</p>
    
  <pre>NiTerrain* pkTerrain = GetTerrain();
NiTerrainStreamingPerformanceListener* pkListener = EE_NEW NiTerrainStreamingPerformanceListener("TerrainPerformanceData.csv");
pkTerrain-&gt;GetResourceManager()-&gt;SetListener(pkListener);</pre>

  <p>
    When developing a resource listener, it is important to recognize that resource
    allocation occurs in a multithreaded environment. Developers should be aware of
    the caveats in multithreaded environments and take necessary precautions in the
    development of their listener object to avoid corruption of their application. Developers
    should also take notice that the listener object implements the 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPointer</span> interface
    virtually, and as a result, the IncRefCount and DecRefCount must be implemented
    manually, or explicitly referred to a <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRefObject</span> implementation.</p>

    Please refer to <span class="NDLSystemFont">

    NiTerrainResourceManager</a></span> class reference documentation for further information on the
    listener interface.</p>
