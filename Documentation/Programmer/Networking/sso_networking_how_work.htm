<h1>How Networking Works</h1>

<p>Gamebryo LightSpeed's network system extends the messaging system and adds remote message
delivery capability. In general, an application that is based on LightSpeed does not need to care
whether it sends a message remotely or locally. The application simply sends a message on a
Category, and the message will be automatically delivered to all recipients that are interested in
that Category, locally and/or remotely. The network system works with the messaging system to make
this process as seamless as possible.</p>

<p>Under the hood, all remote messages (and even local messages if so configured) are exchanged
between processes through a <a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_channel_manager_svc.htm">Channel Manager Service</a>.
When you are creating an online gaming environment with multiple systems, one of the following must
be true:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You need to have a Channel Manager Service running on one of the systems</li>

    <li>You can create an additional standalone system that runs a Channel Manager Service</li>
</ul>

<p>The Channel Manager Service maintains the Category subscription information and knows how to
route messages between remote systems.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_net_svc.htm">Network Service</a>
(NetService) is a system service that is responsible for connecting to the Channel Manager Service
for all communications. This service must be running on all systems that are participating in the
online game. The NetService contains and uses a network library (NetLib) for all remote
communications. You can control which NetLib a given NetService contains in several ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>An existing INetLib pointer can be passed to the NetService constructor</li>

    <li>A string name of a NetLib registered with the NetLib factory can be passed to the
    NetService constructor</li>

    <li>The NetService.NetLib config value can contain the string name of a NetLib registered with
    the NetLib factory</li>
</ul>

<p>The NetService is responsible for connecting to a Channel Manager Service for all
communications.</p>

<p>A NetLib is the heart of what makes the LightSpeed network system work. A NetLib does the
following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Creates and maintains connections to other processes</li>

    <li>Maintains a mapping of which remote connection is interested in which Category</li>
</ul>

<p>In this way NetLib can be used to make sure that messages are only sent to remote processes that
are interested in the Category that message is sent on. A NetLib implements the INetLib
interface.</p>
