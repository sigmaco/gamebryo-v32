<h1>Gamebryo-PhysX Props and Scenes</h1>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 class is the primary object for managing PhysX simulations in the Gamebryo Core Runtime. 
 It provides, among other things, management of <a href="PhysX_Sources.htm">sources</a> 
 and <a href="PhysX_Destinations.htm">destinations</a> and <a href="PhysX_Mesh_Modifiers.htm">mesh 
 modifiers</a>, simulation management, update control and debug rendering 
 of PhysX content. For every PhysX <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene</span> 
 driving Gamebryo objects, there must be one <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 object.</p>

<p>Each <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> object 
 is populated by a collection of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXProp.htm">NiPhysXProp</a></span> 
 objects representing the physical objects in the scene. Props are designed 
 to be added to and deleted from scenes, or replicated many times in a 
 scene. A prop is the smallest unit of PhysX content that Gamebryo manages. 
 Think of a prop as a physics object: a crate, a rag-doll, a machine, etc. 
 It is the class that is streamed in NIF files and that supports cloning.</p>

<h2>Compartments</h2>

<p>PhysX 2.6.2 and later supports the creation of compartments, 
 which are isolated chunks of simulation. The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 class manages Gamebryo's interface to compartments. You should register 
 each compartment you create in a <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene</span> 
 object with the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 that controls each. Each registered compartment needs a unique identifier 
 (an <span class="NDLSystemFont">unsigned int</span>) that is not 0, which 
 is reserved for the default, primary compartment.</p>

<p>Each <a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXPropDesc.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXPropDesc</span></a> object includes functions 
 to specify which compartment the contents of that prop should be instantiated 
 in. Compartments are specified using the identifier you gave them when 
 they were registered with the scene that contains the prop. The primary 
 compartment is identifier 0. You can specify a separate compartment for 
 rigid bodies, fluid and cloth. The exception is software cloth, which 
 can be placed in the default compartment. PhysX-based particle systems 
 also have an option to specify which compartment the particle actors are 
 spawned in.</p>

<h2>Simulation Control</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 class provides wrappers for the PhysX <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene::simulate</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene::fetchResults</span> calls. The 
 wrapper functions, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#simulation_functions">NiPhysXScene::Simulate</a></span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#simulation_functions">NiPhysXScene::FetchResults</a></span>, 
 are intended to be called just as their PhysX counterparts are: the first 
 begins a simulation step and the second attempts to get the results of 
 the most recently started step. If working with Gamebryo-PhysX you must 
 use these functions to step the simulation. The same restrictions as <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene::simulate</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene::fetchResults</span> 
 have on their usage apply to the Gamebryo functions, although Gamebryo 
 automatically meets many of them. </p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 objects provide some application-level services to simplify simulation: 
 </p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Timestep control is 
 provided so that an application can easily use different timesteps for 
 PhysX simulations than those of the rendering frame step length. This 
 makes for more stable simulations in many situations. The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 functions also avoid unnecessary time steps. </li>
	
	<li>There are many restrictions 
 on PhysX SDK calls when the SDK is between a call to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene::simulate</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene::fetchResults</span>. We refer to 
 this as within a <span class="NDLSystemFont">simulate/fetchResults</span> 
 block. Using the locking mechanisms provided by
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/efdPhysX/efdPhysX__PhysXSDKManager.htm">
 efdPhysX::PhysXSDKManager</a></span> 
 and the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#simulation_functions">NiPhysXScene::GetInSimFetch</a></span> 
 function, applications can query and be certain of the simulation state 
 even in multi-threaded environments. Function calls into the PhysX SDK 
 are also structured to batch their access to the SDK to reduce unnecessary 
 locking.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Update Control</h2>

<p>Stepping a simulation updates the PhysX state, but applications 
 must explicitly call update functions to transfer state to and from Gamebryo. 
 These functions are not automatic because there are circumstances in which 
 an application may want fine grained control. See the <a href="Introduction_to_PhysX_Updating.htm">Updating 
 Gamebryo PhysX</a> help pages for an in depth discussion of how to control 
 updates. </p>

<p>Each <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 object maintains an array of <a href="PhysX_Sources.htm">sources</a>, 
 <a href="PhysX_Destinations.htm">destinations</a> and <a href="PhysX_Mesh_Modifiers.htm">mesh 
 modifiers</a> that are managed by the scene. These are automatically added 
 and removed as props are added and removed from the scene. Sources, destinations 
 and modifiers already exist in the props if PhysX content is loaded from 
 a file created with the Gamebryo-PhysX art tools.</p>

<h2>Creating PhysX Content in Software</h2>

<p>You can create PhysX objects directly using PhysX API. 
 However, to tie them to the Gamebryo scene graph you will require sources 
 and destinations to manage state transfer for the actor. These must be 
 added to an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXProp</span> object. The prop 
 must be contained in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> 
 object that is controlling the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene</span> 
 object to which you added the content. Similarly, you may need to remove 
 a source or destination if an actor is destroyed.</p>

<p>You can also use Gamebryo <a href="Introduction_to_PhysX_Streaming_Cloning_and_Snapshots.htm">descriptor 
 classes and snapshots</a> to specify PhysX content. This has the advantage 
 of automatically managing adding and removing objects from the scene, 
 resetting objects, and supporting cloning.</p>

<h2>Additional NiPhysXScene Services</h2>

<p><a href="PhysX_Coordinate_Systems.htm">Coordinate system 
 management,</a> <a href="PhysX_Debug_Rendering.htm">debug 
 rendering,</a> <a href="Introduction_to_PhysX_Streaming_Cloning_and_Snapshots.htm">streaming, 
 cloning and snapshots</a> are all provided through <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 objects. See the linked pages for details. </p>
