<h1>Snapshots and State Restoration </h1>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXProp.htm">NiPhysXProp</a></span> 
 classes contains functionality for holding PhysX simulation state and 
 subsequently restoring it, either by creating a completely new PhysX scene 
 or by resetting the pose and velocity of actors in an existing scene.</p>

<p>The basic unit of scene management is the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXProp.htm">NiPhysXProp</a></span> 
 object, each of which has at most one snapshot describing the PhysX content 
 for that scene. Adding props to an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 object places them in the same simulation, but the snapshots retain information 
 to un-combine them. </p>

<h2>Creating a Snapshot</h2>

<p>A snapshot is always available when a NIF file containing 
 PhysX content is loaded into a Gamebryo application. See the <a href="Loading_a_PhysX_Scene.htm">Loading 
 PhysX content</a> page for details. </p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysXTools/NiPhysXSnapshotExtractor.htm">NiPhysXSnapshotExtractor</a></span> 
 class is provided to create a snapshot from an existing <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene</span> 
 object. It is intended for use in tools, but applications may wish to 
 use it at runtime under some circumstances. Once you have a snapshot, 
 additional states (i.e. positions and velocities) can be added using <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#class_ni_phys_x_scene_1e882a90495e64245712acdbbae117938">NiPhysXScene::AddSnapshotState</a></span>.</p>

<p>Applications can also create an entire snapshot in software 
 using the Gamebryo-PhysX descriptor classes. This is the approach used 
 on the Gamebryo-PhysX art tools. The starting point for software snapshot 
 creation is the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXPropDesc.htm">NiPhysXPropDesc</a></span> 
 class, an instance of which is associated with a prop using the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXProp.htm">NiPhysXProp::SetSnapshot</a></span> 
 function.</p>

<h2>Instantiating PhysX Content from a Snapshot</h2>

<p>Once you have a snapshot, you can create PhysX content 
 from it. The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#class_ni_phys_x_scene_17f2083d5e5a1c4cec3d1252f4dc18b20">NiPhysXScene::CreateSceneFromSnapshot</a></span> 
 function creates all of the PhysX objects represented by the scene's props' 
 snapshots. When an individual prop is added to a scene, its content is 
 created through the same mechanism. The objects are all created in the 
 same <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxScene</span> object, which supports the 
 combination of physics objects from several snapshots together into one 
 simulation.</p>

<h2>Removing PhysX Content via a Snapshot</h2>

<p>When a prop is removed from a scene, its PhysX content 
 is also removed using data contained in the snapshot.</p>

<h2>Storing Multiple States</h2>

<p>Each snapshot contains only one copy of the information 
 needed to create PhysX content, but can store multiple poses and velocities 
 for each actor. When a snapshot is created, it must contain one pose, 
 which is each actor's state at the current time. Each state may be given 
 a name.</p>

<p>Additional states can be saved using the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#class_ni_phys_x_scene_1e882a90495e64245712acdbbae117938">NiPhysXScene::AddSnapshotState</a></span> 
 function. This adds the current state for each actor that appears in the 
 scene and in some snapshot, and returns an index for the state for future 
 access.</p>

<p>The Gamebryo-PhysX art tools may be set up to create 
 multiple initial conditions when a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXProp.htm">NiPhysXProp</a></span> 
 is designed to work with the Gamebryo Animation System. See the documentation 
 for the <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX 
 Extractor tool plug-in</a>. Flags are available in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXProp.htm">NiPhysXProp</a></span> 
 to control what happens to this state on load, as applications may not 
 wish to keep all of it in memory.</p>

<h2>Restoring Actor State</h2>

<p>States can be restored using the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#class_ni_phys_x_scene_11888c88cbc57c1feb68362fcbb83d22f">NiPhysXScene::RestoreSnapshotState</a></span> 
 function. This is the standard way to reset a PhysX scene to its initial 
 conditions in Gamebryo. The demos contain many instances of its use. </p>

<p>While restoring from a snapshot resets the PhysX actor 
 states, it does not push those states to Gamebryo's scene graph. Therefore, 
 a call to <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#class_ni_phys_x_scene_11888c88cbc57c1feb68362fcbb83d22f">NiPhysXScene::RestoreSnapshotState</a></span> 
 is frequently followed by a call to <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#class_ni_phys_x_scene_1d0ba9d929463d41fea4a4b0d990893ae">NiPhysXScene::UpdateDestinations</a></span> 
 and an update of the scene graph. </p>

<p>After restoring state, debug rendering will show incorrect 
 information until a simulation step has completed. Use <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#class_ni_phys_x_scene_1c68a860261b83bea3ee173baed47cb48">NiPhysXScene::ClearDebugGeometry</a></span> 
 to clear the incorrect data. </p>

<h2>Collision Filter State </h2>

<p>The PhysX SDK provides no mechanism for retrieving the 
 state of the collision filtering system from an existing scene (collision 
 groups are retrievable). Applications must explicitly mirror changes to 
 the filter masks, filter ops, and filter constants with calls to <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXSceneDesc.htm">NiPhysXSceneDesc::SetFilterOps</a></span> 
 and similar functions, for every snapshot that the application wishes 
 to reflect the changes. </p>

<h2>SDK State Snapshots </h2>

<p>PhysX SDK state (things set by the SDK, not on a specific 
 scene) can be captured and restored using an instance of the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXSDKDesc.htm">NiPhysXSDKDesc</a></span> 
 class. </p>

<h2>Limitations </h2>

<p>The snapshot functionality does not capture all possible 
 PhysX state, and restore does not necessarily return a scene to the exact 
 state at the time the snapshot was taken. There are four reasons for this: 
 the enormous number of classes required to represent all possible PhysX 
 objects; the inability to extract some state using the PhysX API; the 
 fact that it is sometimes faster to destroy a scene and re-create it than 
 reset an existing scene; and the PhysX SDK is non-deterministic, even 
 for simple scenes. Gamebryo PhysX only guarantees that a snapshot will 
 capture all the things that the art tool pipeline can author. Specifically: 
 </p>

<ul>
	
	<li>NxWheelShapes are not 
 captured. </li>
	
	<li>Only D6-type joints 
 are captured. </li>
	
	<li>PhysX user data is 
 not captured. </li>
	
	<li>Continuous collision 
 detection (CCD) information is not captured. </li>
	
	<li>Restore assumes that 
 there have been no structural changes to the scene, such as the additional 
 or removal of actors. It does not restore broken joints, reset collision 
 flags, or anything other than pose and velocity information on dynamic 
 actors and cloth. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Extending Snapshot Functionality </h2>

<p>The work of storing and restoring the PhysX scene is 
 done by a set of "descriptor" classes, each responsible for 
 a particular PhysX object. See the documentation on <a href="Extending_PhysX_Streaming.htm">extending 
 descriptors</a> for information on how to extend the functionality of 
 snapshots. </p>
