<h1>PhysX-based Particle System Properties </h1>

<p>This section looks in detail at the things to consider 
 when creating a PhysX particle system for Gamebryo. </p>

<h2>Particle Actors </h2>

<p>The data from which particle actors are created is stored 
 in a set of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXActorDesc.htm">NiPhysXActorDesc</a></span> 
 objects associated with the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysXParticle/NiPhysXPSParticleSystem.htm">NiPhysXPSParticleSystem</a> 
 or <a href="../../Reference/NiPhysXParticle/NiPhysXPSMeshParticleSystem.htm">NiPhysXPSMeshParticleSystem</a></span> 
 object for the particle system. One actor prototype is required for each 
 generation of particles. The particle system object also keeps pools of 
 created actors to avoid the overhead of creating and deleting actors. 
 This is true even if the particle system is using sprites for rendering, 
 because PhysX must have a collision shape to operate on. If the pools 
 are to be created on load, it is important to specify an <span class="NDLSystemFont">Actor 
 Pool Region</span> which bounds a region of space in which the dormant 
 actors will be placed. This avoids a major performance hit from the broad-phase 
 collision detection in PhysX. </p>

<p>The actors used as particles have a large influence 
 on how the system behaves. Standard Gamebryo particle system modifiers 
 should be viewed as force fields and appearance controlling tools for 
 particles. PhysX then provides whatever collision handling mechanism you 
 desire. Particles could collide with each other, or be set not to. The 
 actors could be small sphere shapes to get smooth collision response, 
 or boxes to get particles that bounce erratically. You can disable gravity. 
 The possibilities are enormous. </p>

<p>There is only one restriction on the type of actors 
 used as particles: they must not have the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NX_AF_DISABLE_COLLISION</span> 
 flag set. This flag is used by the PhysX particle system to disable actors 
 when they are not in use. Use collision groups or collision filtering 
 to disable collisions between particles and their environment. Of course, 
 any PhysX restrictions on actors must still be respected. </p>



<h2>Coordinate Systems </h2>

<p>The update of particle positions is significantly more 
 efficient if the particle system and the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 are in the same coordinate system. A flag can be set on the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysXParticle/NiPhysXPSParticleSystem.htm">NiPhysXPSParticleSystem</a></span> 
 or <a href="../../Reference/NiPhysXParticle/NiPhysXPSMeshParticleSystem.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXPSMeshParticleSystem</span></a> object to inform 
 Gamebryo of this situation.</p>



<h2>Particle Rotation </h2>

<p>Particle rotation can be controlled by the particle 
 system controllers or can be extracted from PhysX. If controlled by Gamebryo, 
 the rotations are NOT updated to PhysX, so the actors and the rendered 
 meshes may have different orientations. </p>



<h2>Smart Pointer Considerations </h2>

<p>The PhysX-based particle systems store smart pointers 
 to the PhysX scene to which they are attached. Hence, the PhysX scene 
 will not be destroyed until after the scene graph containing the particle 
 system has been deleted. Deletion of the PhysX particle system requires 
 an active PhysX SDK, so it is important that
  <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/efdPhysX/efdPhysX__PhysXSDKManager.htm">
 efdPhysX::PhysXSDKManager::Shutdown</a></span>
 be called <span class="NDLEmphasis">after</span> the scene graph has been deleted. </p>



<h2>Mixing PhysX and Gamebryo Particles </h2>

<p>PhysX and Gamebryo particles should not be mixed in 
 the same system. However, the spawning capabilities of <a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSParticleSystem.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiPSParticleSystem</span></a> be used to spawn particles 
 in a different system. To achieve this effect, set the particle death 
 spawner (of type <a href="../../Reference/NiParticle/NiPSSpawner.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPSpawner</span></a>) on the PhysX-based particle 
 system and add the spawner to the destination system. The spawned particles 
 are hence created in the Gamebryo system upon death in the PhysX system. 
 The reverse arrangement is also possible. </p>
