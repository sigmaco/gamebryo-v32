<h1>Updating an NiPhysXPSFluidSystem or NiPhysXPSMeshFluidSystem 
 </h1>

<p>There are three steps to updating a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysXFluid/NiPhysXPSFluidSystem.htm">NiPhysXPSFluidSystem</a></span> 
 object (<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysXFluid/NiPhysXPSMeshFluidSystem.htm">NiPhysXPSMeshFluidSystem</a></span> 
 is the same). The following cycle must be followed, but note that you 
 can open the loop at any point. For example, if processing physics asynchronously, 
 then the frame is split between <span class="NDLSystemFont">Simulate</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span>. If simulation is synchronous 
 and an application is culling geometry, then the loop is probably best 
 split after <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> on the particle system, 
 when the bounding volumes are up to date. </p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Call <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> 
 on the particle system (or the scene graph in which it resides). This 
 updates the particle counts and runs through all the simulation steps. 
 The update of a particle system is performed asynchronously in Gamebryo 
 using the <a href="../NiFloodgate/Introduction_to_NiFloodgate.htm">NiFloodgate</a> 
 library and mesh modifiers. The physics simulation must not be active 
 during the entire period that the particle system update taking place. 
 Gamebryo enforces this requirement by completing any particle system update 
 modifiers when simulation is started. For optimal performance it is advantageous 
 to do as must other work as possible between updating the particle system 
 and starting simulation, so that the parallel particle simulation has 
 time to finish.</li>
	
	<li>Call <span class="NDLSystemFont">Simulate</span> 
 on the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 with which the fluid system is associated. This begins the simulation 
 step. Note that you can use any timing scheme you like. The physics simulation 
 and the particle system use independent timing mechanisms.</li>
	
	<li>Call <span class="NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span> 
 on the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 with which the fluid system is associated. This finishes the simulation 
 and causes particles to be emitted in the particle system and updates 
 caches of transformation state. If your particles aren't appearing, it 
 may be because the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysXFluid/NiPhysXFluidDest.htm">NiPhysXFluidDest</a></span> 
 object is disabled, or simulation is not finishing. The position update 
 step is done here because transformation information is available at this 
 point.</li>
</ul>

<p>As stated above, this loop need not correspond to a 
 single frame - rendering could happen at any point in the cycle. However, 
 <b>there must be at least one Gamebryo particle 
 system update for every simulation step that adds or removes fluid
 particles</b>
. The creation 
 and deletion of particles may be missed if the simulation steps multiple 
 times between particle system update, which will result in instability 
 and likely crashes.</p>

<h2>Simulation Timing </h2>

<p>Particle positions are not interpolated between physics 
 time steps under any circumstances (it is too expensive to maintain dual 
 particle state for interpolation). It is hence important to step the physics 
 at a rate that is high enough to ensure smooth-looking particle motion. 
 </p>

<p>If the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 object is using fixed-step timing for updating the physics, then there 
 are situations in which multiple calls to <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> 
 occur for each <em>effective</em> call to <span class="NDLSystemFont">Simulate</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span>. This happens when the 
 frame rate is higher than the physics update frequency. It should not 
 cause problems, but if you notice particle locations staying the same 
 over calls to <span class="NDLSystemFont">Simulate</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span>, 
 it may just be that the simulation was already ahead of the current frame 
 and hence didn't step.</p>

<h2>Fluid System Reset</h2>

<p>When the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#snapshots">NiPhysXScene::RestoreSceneFromSnapshot</a></span> 
 function is called the fluid systems in the scene will reset, which means 
 removing all particles. The particle system rendering the fluid is also 
 reset. The particle system must also be explicitly reset if, for any reason, 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxFluid::removeAllParticles</span> function 
 is called directly on the fluid.</p>
