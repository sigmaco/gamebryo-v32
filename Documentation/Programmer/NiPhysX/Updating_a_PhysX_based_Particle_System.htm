<h1>Updating a PhysX-based Particle System </h1>

<p>There are four steps to updating a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysXParticle/NiPhysXPSParticleSystem.htm">NiPhysXPSParticleSystem</a></span> 
 or <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysXParticle/NiPhysXPSMeshParticleSystem.htm">NiPhysXPSMeshParticleSystem</a></span> 
 object. The following cycle must be followed, but note that you can open 
 the loop at any point. For example, if processing physics asynchronously, 
 then the frame is split between <span class="NDLSystemFont">Simulate</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span>. If simulation is synchronous 
 and an application is culling geometry, then the loop is probably best 
 split after <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> on the particle system. 
 </p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Call <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> 
 on the particle system (or the scene graph in which it resides). This 
 updates the particle counts and runs through all the particle controllers 
 and simulation steps. The particle update actually begins the parallel 
 update of particles using Floodgate, which will complete when an appropriate 
 synchronization point is reached: when the particle system is culled and 
 determined visible, or when simulation is started. To maximize performance 
 it is advisable to perform as much other computation as possible between 
 the particle system update and simulation starting. Internally, when the 
 simulation has been completed each particle holds a target velocity change 
 for the current step.</li>
	
	<li>Call <span class="NDLSystemFont">Simulate</span> 
 on the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 with which the particle system is associated. This begins the simulation 
 step which forces any scene graph particle system update currently executing 
 in parallel to complete. Note that you can use any timing scheme you like. 
 The physics simulation and the particle system use independent timing 
 mechanisms. </li>
	
	<li>Call <span class="NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span> 
 on the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 with which the particle system is associated. This finishes the simulation.</li>
	
	<li>Call <span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateDestinations</span> 
 on the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm">NiPhysXScene</a></span> 
 with which the particle system is associated. This caches some transformation 
 state and informs the scene graph particle system that it is ready for 
 another update.</li>
</ul>

<p>As stated above, this loop need not correspond to a 
 single frame - rendering could happen at any point in the cycle. </p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Simulation Timing </p>

<p>Particle positions are not interpolated between physics 
 time steps under any circumstances (it is too expensive to maintain dual 
 particle state for interpolation). It is hence important to step the physics 
 at a rate that is high enough to ensure smooth-looking particle motion. 
 </p>

<p>If the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> 
 object is using fixed-step timing for updating the physics, then there 
 are situations in which multiple calls to <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> 
 occur for each <em>effective</em> call to <span class="NDLSystemFont">Simulate</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span>. This happens when the 
 frame rate is higher than the physics update frequency. It should not 
 cause problems, but if you notice particle locations staying the same 
 over calls to <span class="NDLSystemFont">Simulate</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">FetchResults</span>, 
 it may just be that the simulation was already ahead of the current frame 
 and hence didn't step. You might wish to use variable timing on the PhysX 
 scene in such circumstances (when the frame rate is high).</p>
