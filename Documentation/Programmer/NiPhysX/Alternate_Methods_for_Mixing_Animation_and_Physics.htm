<h1>Alternate Methods for Mixing Animation and Physics</h1>

<h2>Key-frame Guidance</h2>

<p>The other pages in this section describe the use of 
 Gamebryo's animation system and physics so that the physics input and 
 key-framed input can be combined through blending to produce the final 
 motion. While this is a good way to ensure smooth transitions between 
 different types of control, it is not always the best approach.</p>

<p>Consider a situation in which you want the key-frames 
 to be a "guide" to the motion, but that physics should always 
 have the final say. For example, a character that is walking and hits 
 a log with their feet should stumble and maybe fall, even if the key-frames 
 say to keep walking as if the log were not there. Blending is not a good 
 way to achieve this because it is hard to set the blend weights to produce 
 reasonable motion.</p>

<p>To achieve a more realistic guide behavior, use two 
 copies of the skeleton. One is key-framed controlled, as usual, and serves 
 as the reference motion: what you want the character to try to do. The 
 other skeleton is physically controlled using forces that are derived 
 from the reference skeleton. These forces try to pull the physics skeleton 
 into strict alignment with the animated skeleton, but if something prevents 
 the animation from happening, such as an obstacle, then the forces produce 
 a decent physical reaction instead. You can also use forces when the character 
 is falling to push it toward a known resting pose, so that the "get-up" 
 animation will start correctly.</p>

<p>Gamebryo does not provide any classes to &nbsp;help 
 with this situation, but it can certainly be arranged. The challenge is 
 in computing the forces between the reference and the physics skeleton. 
 They need to be strong to keep physics following the animation, but to 
 strong and they will produce non-physical motion when the character hits 
 an obstacle. Most likely, you will need to modify the force strength based 
 on feedback from the environment. For example, use kinematic control (infinite 
 force) until the character touches something, then ramp the forces down 
 and up again while the character responds physically and then recovers. 
 It is this perceived need for adaptive forces that discourages the Gamebryo 
 team from providing code to support guided physics control.</p>

<h2>Instant Transitions</h2>

<p>In some cases the blending mechanism may be overkill. 
 For example, consider a helicopter rotor that can be broken due to a missile 
 hit. The rotor is animated most of the time, but must transition to physics 
 when damaged. While this can be easily set up using blending to perform 
 the transition, it is simpler to just stop animation and start physics 
 immediately. The most important thing in instant transitions is to set 
 the initial velocity and angular velocity so that they match, as closely 
 as possible, the animated velocities at the time of the switch.</p>
