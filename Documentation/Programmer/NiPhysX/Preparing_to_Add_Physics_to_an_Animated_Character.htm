<h1>Preparing to Add Physics to an Animated Character</h1>

<p>The Gamebryo tool chain is the place to begin setting 
 up a character that is to be both animated and physically controlled. 
 The <a href="../../Tools/animation_tool/Introduction_to_PhysX_in_Animation_Tool.htm">Animation 
 Tool documentation</a> section describes in detail the step to perform. 
 A character (or any animated object) that has been rigged for physics 
 is loaded similar to any other character, typically using the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiActorManager.htm">NiActorManager</a></span> 
 class. Some additional set up is then performed.</p>

<p>The first step is to load the KFM file with the animation 
 data and the NIF file with the PhysX data. Care must be taken to explicitly 
 load the NIF so that the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiActorManager</span> 
 does not discard the PhysX data:</p>

<pre>
// Create the Actor Manager. Tell it not to load the NIF file
m_spAM = NiActorManager::Create(ConvertMediaFilename("rag_arm.kfm"), false, false);
 
// Load the NIF file with the PhysX content in it
NiStream* pkStream = NiNew NiStream();
pkStream-&gt;Load("character.nif");
 
// Look for the PhysX content.
for (unsigned int ui = 0; ui &lt; pkStream-&gt;GetObjectCount(); ui++)
{
    if (NiIsKindOf(NiPhysXProp, pkStream-&gt;GetObjectAt(ui)))
    {
        // We have found the PhysX content in the NIF.
        m_spProp = (NiPhysXProp*)pkStream-&gt;GetObjectAt(ui);
    }
}
 
// Instantiate physics content
m_spPhysicsScene-&gt;AddProp(m_spProp);
    
// Set up the actor manager with the loaded file.
m_spAM-&gt;ReloadNIFFile(pkStream, false);
 
// Load all the sequences
m_spAM-&gt;LoadAllSequenceData(pkStream);
 
// Done loading
NiDelete pkStream;
 
// Update the actor manager.
m_spAM-&gt;Update(0.0f);
</pre>

<p>At this stage the actor manager is loaded, as is all 
 the animation content, the scene graph and the physics content. Next we 
 create the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXSequenceManager.htm">NiPhysXSequenceManager</a></span> 
 and set it up for use with the loaded data:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spSeqMgr = NiNew NiPhysXSequenceManager;</span></p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spSeqMgr-&gt;SetManager(m_spAM-&gt;GetControllerManager(), m_spProp);</span></p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXSequenceManager</span> 
 object is passed the controller manager that is handling the animation 
 sequences, and the PhysX prop object that holds all the physics information, 
 particularly the sources and destinations that connect PhysX and Gamebryo. 
 The implementation assumes that there is one <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXTransformDest.htm">NiPhysXTransformDest</a></span> 
 object for each animated scene graph object that you wish physics to control. 
 A <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXDynamicSrc.htm">NiPhysXDynamicSrc</a></span> 
 object is created to correspond to every <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXTransformDest</span> 
 object. This provides kinematic control when a scene graph object is animated. 
 All of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXTransformDest</span> objects 
 that have animated targets are removed. A callback is also set for every 
 sequence controlled by the controller manager, with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXSequenceManager</span> 
 object as the receiver of the callback. This allows the object to track 
 activation and deactivation of sequences.</p>

<p>The final set up step is to specify which sequences 
 are physics controlled:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spSeqMgr-&gt;MakeSequencePhysical(m_spAM-&gt;GetSequenceData(m_uiSeqID));</span></p>

<p>This line of code sets one sequence (the one with ID<span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"> m_uiSeqID</span> in the actor manager) to be physical. 
 The <span class="NDLSystemFont">MakeSequencePhysical</span> function adds 
 a set of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXPoseBufferDest.htm">NiPhysXPoseBufferDest</a></span> 
 objects targeted at each transform evaluator in the given sequence that 
 controls a scene graph node that PhysX also controls. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXPoseBufferDest</span> 
 objects write their physics derived values directly to the pose buffer 
 of the active animation. The corresponding evaluator channels are temporarily 
 disabled in the active sequence so these physics values are not overwritten.</p>

<p>A physics controlled sequence can be reverted back to 
 a standard animation sequence through the use of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXSequenceManager::RevertPhysicalSequence</span>.</p>

<p>The process of setting up sequences with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXSequenceManager</span> 
 object is not thread-safe, so it should only be done with the same thread 
 as is controlling the actor manager object, or some form of locking must 
 be used. Specifically, problems will occur if sequences are activated 
 or deactivated by another thread while the above code is executing.</p>

<p>The <a href="Runtime_Management_of_Physics_and_Animation_Blending.htm">next 
 page</a> describes the run-time behavior of the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXSequenceManager.htm">NiPhysXSequenceManager</a></span> 
 class.</p>
