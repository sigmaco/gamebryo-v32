<h1>PhysX Coordinate Systems</h1>

<p>The coordinate system in which physics is simulated may not be the same as
the one that the corresponding Gamebryo objects use. Furthermore, when two
PhysX props are loaded from a file and placed in the same scene, there may be
some relative transformation between them. This page discusses the coordinate
systems involved in working with PhysX in Gamebryo.</p>

<h2>PhysX Coordinate Transformations</h2>

<p>There are many situations in which the global coordinates of a PhysX scene
may not correspond to Gamebryo global coordinates. This is particularly the
case of large or small worlds, because PhysX has an optimal scale at which to
operate which may differ from the units you wish to use in your game. Relative
transformations are then needed to convert your world scale to a manageable
PhysX scale. PhysX is tuned with the assumption that 1 unit is about 1 meter in
physical coordinates.</p>

<p>Two transformations are used to convert from PhysX coordinates to Gamebryo
global coordinates. Starting in PhysX coordinates, all linear dimensions are
uniformly scaled by an application-defined scale factor, accessed through
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#physx_coordinate_system">NiPhysXScene::SetScaleFactor</a></span>
and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#physx_coordinate_system">NiPhysXScene::GetScaleFactor</a></span>.
If you are creating PhysX collision shapes in software, it is extremely
important that you scale it by the inverse of the scale factor, so that when
the PhysX state is scaled back again for Gamebryo, everything comes out in the
right place and size. In fact, everything that an application <em>directly</em>
sends to the PhysX SDK should be scaled for PhysX coordinates, in the knowledge
that Gamebryo will scale it by the Scale Factor before applying it back to the
scene graph. Use debug geometry to verify these settings.</p>

<p>The Scale Factor can also be set in the art tools so that geometry is
pre-scaled for use as collision geometry. Note that the art tool scale input,
in the <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX
Extractor Tool Plug-in</a>, is the inverse of this scale factor (or the scale
from Gamebryo to transform to PhysX). The scale is applied to velocities,
forces, and any other physical quantity with a spatial element to its
definition.</p>

<p>The second transformation is the PhysX Scene transform, accessed through
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#physx_coordinate_system">NiPhysXScene::SetSceneXform</a></span>
and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXScene.htm#physx_coordinate_system">NiPhysXScene::GetSceneXform</a></span>.
This transformation should be set at run-time to translate and rotate the PhysX
scene coordinate system with respect to the Gamebryo scene. While it may
contain scale components, scaling a PhysX scene using this transform is not
recommended, if only because it is much harder to keep track of transformations
if you do so.</p>

<p>You can modify this transformation at runtime if you want the PhysX global
coordinates to move in the Gamebryo scene (for example, simulating objects on a
moving vehicle). Note that if you animate this transform the inertial effects
on the PhysX objects will be incorrect. The physics motion will remain valid in
only a limited set of cases, such as constant linear velocity of the PhysX
global frame (a constant inertial frame).</p>

<h2>Prop Coordinate Systems</h2>

<p>It is important that the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span>
object and all of the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXProp.htm">NiPhysXProp</a></span> objects have
the same value for the Scale Factor. Incorrect transformations will result if
this rule is broken.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXProp</span> objects have an additional
transformation that is applied once when the prop is added to the scene. It is
used to transform the PhysX properties of the object, and should be the
relative transformation between the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXScene</span> coordinate system that the prop is in, and
the prop's internal coordinate system (the coordinate system it was created
in). For instance, if adding many crates to a scene, the prototype crate would
be created at the origin in its scene, then each instance would be added with
an initial transform placing the crate in its target position in the scene.</p>

<p>The transformation for props is accessed by <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXProp::GetXform</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPhysXProp::SetXform</span>. In addition to object creation,
the transformation is also used to transform state during <a href=
"Snapshots_and_State_Restoration.htm">snapshot operations</a>.</p>

<p>If a PhysX actor is driving a Gamebryo scene graph node, then the prop's
transformation will take precedence over any Gamebryo scene graph
transformation as soon as <span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateDestinations</span>
is called. For PhysX actors driven by sources, the scene graph transformation
will take precedence as soon as <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateSources</span> is called.</p>
