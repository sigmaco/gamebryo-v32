  <h1>
    TerrainService
  </h1>
  <p>
    The TerrainService class provides the basic functionality required to include 
    terrain support in an application. Like any other Game Framework service, this 
    service should be added during the initialization of the application and before 
    any block files are loaded.
  </p>
  <p>
    The TerrainService implements the following sets of functionality:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Automatic Terrain entity preloading, loading, unloading and management. </li>
    <li>Material and Material package management. </li>
    <li>Picking service integration. </li>
    <li>Rapid iteration of terrain assets. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This service is recommended for applications that require basic terrain support 
    (most non PhysX game applications).
  </p>
  <h3>
    Dependencies
  </h3>
  <p>
    The use of TerrainService requires the following prerequisites to be met:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>MessageService must be available via the service manager </li>
    <li>SceneGraphService must be available via the service manager </li>
    <li>EntityManager must be available via the service manager </li>
    <li>AssetLocatorService must be available via the service manager </li>
    <li><i>(Optional) </i>ReloadManager is required in order for rapid-iteration 
      features of the TerrainService to operate. </li>
    <ul>
      <li>The ReloadManager must be available before the initialization of the 
        TerrainService for this functionality to operate. </li>
    </ul>
    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrain</span> library must be configured to 
      use a storage system that follows the default filenaming policy. </li>
    <li>The StandardModelLibrary must be up to date and contain the Terrain model. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When developing applications, please make sure any smart pointers to the Terrain 
    that the application may maintain are released before the TerrainService is 
    shutdown. Not following this rule may result in the application experiencing a 
    deadlock on shutdown. See the troubleshooting documentation on the NiTerrain 
    library for more information.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Integration to the PickService
  </h2>
  <p>
    The TerrainService provides a customized pick policy for use with Terrain 
    entities that is not registered by default.
  </p>
  <p>
    To register this pick policy, the following code may be used:
  </p>
  <pre>
PickService* pPickService = pServiceManager-&gt;GetSystemServiceAs&lt;PickService&gt;();
pPickService-&gt;RegisterPickPolicy(&quot;Terrain&quot;, 
                  EE_NEW egmTerrain::TerrainService::TerrainPickPolicy(pTerrainService));
</pre>
  <h2>
    Loading/Unloading sectors
  </h2>
  <p>
    The TerrainService overrides the default sector selector object assigned to 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrain</span>
    objects such that the service may directly manage what sectors are 
    loaded/unloaded within the application. The default sector selector is still 
    maintained as a secondary means of selecting sectors to load/unload, though any 
    calls to the following interface on the TerrainService will override the 
    automatic functionality of the selector for these sectors:
  </p>
  <pre>
void TerrainService::LoadSector(NiTerrain* pTerrain, efd::SInt16 sectorX, efd::SInt16 sectorY);

void TerrainService::UnloadSector(NiTerrain* pTerrain, efd::SInt16 sectorX, efd::SInt16 sectorY);
</pre>
  <p>
    A developer wishing to override the sector selector within a Game Framework 
    application should consider creating their own subclass of TerrainService and 
    override the 'InitializeTerrain' function. The user may then assign their own 
    sector selector object to the terrain object such that the TerrainService will 
    treat it as the default selector and use it in conjunction with the above 
    interface.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Customization of the Terrain Service
  </h2>
  <p>
    It may be the case that the user wishes to take advantage of some of the 
    customizable features of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTerrain</span> library. In order to take advantage of 
    these features from within a Game Framework application, the user may define a 
    custom TerrainService class and override the 'CreateTerrain' or 'InitializeTerrain' functions. The 'CreateTerrain'
    function is used to instantiate an NiTerrain object and must return a valid NiTerrain, and the 'InitializeTerrain' function 
    function is called on each NiTerrain object that has successfully loaded it's configuration from disk and provides a 
    suitable place to setup any of the customizable features described in the NiTerrain library based on custom properties on
    the entity that is loading it.
  </p>
  <p>
    When overriding these functions, please be sure to call the base implementation of 
    the function at the beginning of the new implementation, and to be careful of 
    any customizations that the base class being derived from may have put in place 
    (i.e. The custom sector selector object implemented by the base TerrainService, 
    or the PhysX custom data policy employed by the PhysXTerrainService).
