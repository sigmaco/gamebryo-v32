  <h1>
    Time Of Day Object
  </h1>
  <p>
    A popular application of a sky rendering system is to simulate changes to the environmental
    effects over time. These changes could be simulating changes in lighting over the
    course of the day, or even a more specific animation over the course of time in
    a level. To achieve this, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiEnvironment/Introduction_to_NiEnvironment_Class_Reference.htm">NiEnvironment</a></span> library has included a class to handle
    basic animation of environmental effects according to a sequence of keyframes over
    a timeline. This animation is controlled through an instance of a 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiEnvironment/NiTimeOfDay.htm">NiTimeOfDay</a></span> class.
  </p>
  <p>
    This class not only allows for animation of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiEnvironment</span> but can also be used
    to apply time of day animation to any object whose properties have been registered
    with it.
  </p>
  <h2>
    The Animation
  </h2>
  <p>
    Time of day animation is controlled by first registering properties that may be
    changed over the course of time. These properties may then be bound to an animation
    sequence that will adjust them over time. The capabilities of the 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiAnimation_Class_Reference_Intro.htm">NiAnimation</a></span> library
    are harnessed to control the interpolation of values over time, while the NiTimeOfDay
    class controls the loading, binding and progression of these animations through
    time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Basic usage of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTimeOfDay</span> class involves the following steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create an instance of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTimeOfDay</span>.</li>
    <li>Register the properties of the scene to be animated.</li>
    <li>Load the animations from disk.</li>
    <li>Configure the speed of animation, and enable the animation.</li>
    <li>Update the class regularly (every frame, or every N frames).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    When using the EnvironmentService, all those steps are automatically handled when
    a TimeOfDay entity is added to a scene and when TimeOfDayEditable objects are added.
    Refer to the <a href="../egmTerrain/egmTerrain_EnvironmentService.htm">Environment - Game Framework documentation</a> for more information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Further sections of this documentation describe how to carry out each of these steps.
    This is mainly for users not using the Game Framework system or who want to use
    their own EnvironmentService. For more detailed information on the interface, please
    consult the class reference page for <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiEnvironment/NiTimeOfDay.htm">NiTimeOfDay</a></span>.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Registering Properties
  </h2>
  <p>
    All properties to be animated by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTimeOfDay</span> class must first be registered.
    Registration of properties that may be animated may be performed through invoking
    the template function "BindProperty".
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to bind a property, the developer must make sure the following requirements
    are met.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A unique property name must be selected for the property. </li>
    <li>The property must control one of the following types: </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Float, or </li>
      <li>NiColorA. </li>
    </ul>
    <li>The property must be present on an instantiated object. </li>
    <li>A functor class capable of setting the value of the property must be provided.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A default templated functor is available in the core library allowing for properties
    to be set while using a set function that only takes in the new value in parameter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once these requirements are met an instance of a functor can be created and bound
    to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTimeOfDay</span> as follows: (The following example uses the default functor)
  </p>
  <pre>
NiTTimeOfDayDefaultFunctor&lt;NiAnimatedObject, PropertyType&gt; kFunctor = 
  NiTTimeOfDayDefaultFunctor&lt;NiAnimatedObject, PropertyType&gt;(
    pkAnimatedObject, &amp;NiAnimatedObject::SetPropertyFunction) 
  pkTimeOfDay-&gt;BindProperty&lt;
    NiTTimeOfDayDefaultFunctor&lt;NiAnimatedObject, PropertyType&gt;, PropertyType&gt;
    ("PropertyName", kFunctor);
</pre>
  <p>
    When updating the <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiEnvironment/NiTimeOfDayController.htm">NiTimeOfDayController</a></span> during the animation phase, the controller
    will call the functor's SetValue function.
  </p>
  <h3>
    The Default Functor
  </h3>
  <p>
    When creating a default functor, the object that should be animated and the function
    that should be called to set the property are passed in the constructor. The default
    functor is templated to support all types. It also provides an inlined SetValue
    function which will simply call the associated function pointer.
  </p>
  <p>
    For more information, please consult the class reference page for 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiEnvironment/NiTTimeOfDayDefaultFunctor.htm">NiTTimeOfDayDefaultFunctor</a></span>.
  </p>
  <h3>
    </a>Creating a Custom Functor
  </h3>
  <p>
    Custom functors can be created to suit any type of data being used as a animatable
    property. The main requirements when creating a custom functor are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A functor <b>must</b> have a SetValue function. This should: </li>
    <ul>
      <li>be declared inline, and </li>
      <li>follow the signature inline void SetValue(PropertyType value). </li>
    </ul>
    <li>The functor should be templated to support any type.&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
    Timing Configuration
  </h2>
  <p>
    A number of timing options are available on the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTimeOfDay</span> class to allow the overall
    animation to be adjusted. The following table lists the available timing options
    that may be configured and what their effect on the animation will be.
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>
          Timing Option
        </th>
        <th>
          Default Value
        </th>
        <th>
          Usage
        </th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <b>Active</b> </p>
        </td>
        <td>
          false
        </td>
        <td>
          This flag states whether the animation is active or not. If this value is false,
          then the animation will not progress (essentially paused) and no values will be
          changed.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <b>Time</b>
        </td>
        <td>
          0 seconds
        </td>
        <td>
          This represents the current time in the animation. This value may be set directly,
          or it will be updated over time while the animation is active.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <b>Animation Duration</b>
        </td>
        <td>
          0 seconds
        </td>
        <td>
          This represents the length of the animation over time. Because day/night animations
          are cyclic, this value is important in controlling the interpolation of values back
          to their initial state for the next cycle.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <b>Time Multiplier</b>
        </td>
        <td>
          1.0f
        </td>
        <td>
          This value may be used to speed up/slow down the animation. It is also worth noting
          that by setting this value to 0.0f, the regular updates will not advance the animation,
          though the values will still be updated. This allows the developer to manage the
          progression of time manually by manipulating the time value directly and still calling
          update.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h2>
    Updating the Animation
  </h2>
  <p>
    In order to maintain the animation of the scene, the 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTimeOfDay</span> object needs to
    be updated regularly over the course of time. Usually this would be done once per
    frame, though depending on how granular the animation needs to be, this may be limited
    to every N frames by calling the update manually.
  </p>
  <p>
    For convenience, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTimeOfDay</span> object is a subclass of
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a></span>, and hence can
    attach to the regular Gamebryo scene graph hierarchy. Upon attachment to the scene,
    the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTimeOfDay</span> object will handle the progression of the animation as the scene
    update is propagated each frame. Nothing more needs to be done. Alternatively, the
    Update function may be called directly on the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTimeOfDay</span> object, with the amount
    of time passed since the beginning of the animation passed in as a parameter.
