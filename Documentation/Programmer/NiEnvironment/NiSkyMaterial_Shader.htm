  <h1>
    NiSkyMaterial Shader
  </h1>
  <p>
    The sky material shader has been developed to accommodate a number of common sky
    generation use cases and hence allows the quick deployment of basic sky within a
    scene. The following effects may be achieved through application of the 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSkyMaterial</span>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Procedural atmospheric scattering simulated sky color - As described by Sam O'Neil's
      article in GPU Gems 2. </li>
    <li>Gradient sky color. </li>
    <li>Cube mapped skybox. </li>
    <li>Blended combinations of the above effects. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The information contained in this documentation will describe how a developer can
    configure an object with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSkyMaterial</span> shader to achieve the above effects and
    modify it to fit their application.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Sky Shader Pipeline Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
    The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSkyMaterial</span> pipeline is configured as a set of stages. Each stage generates
    a color and then blends this color with the output from the previous stage according
    to its configuration. For this reason, the stages of a sky shader are called 'Blend
    Stages'. The current version of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSkyMaterial</span> shader supports a maximum of 5
    blend stages.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following diagram represents the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSkyMaterial</span> shader pipeline graphically.
  </p>
  <p>

    <p class="FigureCaption">

  </div>
  <p>
    As depicted in the diagram above, the initial color of the sky is generated as the
    output of an atmospheric scattering calculation. Please note that it is not necessary
    to include atmospheric scattering (this color can be configured to be black by turning
    off the scattering calculation). The final output of the shader will be the
    output color of the final blend stage.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Atmospheric Sky Configuration
  </h2>
  <p>
    The implementation of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSkyMaterial</span> atmospheric scattering shader code is based
    on Sam O'Neil's article
    <a href="../../ThirdPartyCode/All/thirdparty_AtmosphericScattering.htm"> <i>"Accurate Atmospheric Scattering"</i> from GPU Gems 2</a>.
    The configuration of this part of the shader will be outlined in this section. For
    detailed information on the implementation of the technique, please refer to the
    article.
  </p>
  <p>
    The atmospheric scattering stage of the sky shader has a large number of configurable
    properties. The most important of which is the calculation mode. The following calculation
    modes are available:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>None - No atmospheric scattering calculations will be performed. The output color
      will be black. </li>
    <li>Pixel based - Because the scattering calculations are extremely directional and
      non-linear, this mode offers the best effect in all situations, however it gives
      very poor performance (most of the calculations are performed in the pixel shader).
    </li>
    <li>Vertex based - This mode gives much better performance than the pixel based mode,
      however artifacts may appear that rely upon the geometry of the rendered object.
      For this reason, the NiSkyDome class has been written such that the vertices can
      be distributed closer to the horizon for better results when using this mode. This
      is the recommended mode to use. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Aside from the calculation mode, there a number of variables that can affect the
    appearance of the atmospheric scattering algorithm. These values can all be configured
    through the <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <a href="../../Reference/NiEnvironment/NiAtmosphere.htm">NiAtmosphere</a></span> object. The following table outlines these variables, their
    typical values, and what their effect on the appearance of the sky will be. For
    a visual demonstration of each of these variables, in Toolbench add an Environment
    entity into the block and adjust the Entity properties.

          This value is a multiplier to finely tune the size of the sun in the sky. It is

          The Rayleigh scattering constant controls how different colors are scattered in
          the atmosphere. Higher values will result in more varied colors such as redder sunsets.
          A value of 0 will result in no scattering, and hence a black sky.

          The Mie scattering constant controls how the sky responds to dust particles in the

          will result in higher general haze on the horizon and a larger sun size. Lower values
          will result in less haze, and a value of 0 will remove the sun from the sky entirely.

          These values have the most effect over the color of the sky shader. They represent
          the wavelengths of the red, green and blue channels. By default they are set to
          their physical norms, but by adjusting them, different colors can be replaced giving
          rise to a range of effects and alien skies. For example, adjusting the green wavelength
          to be close to the physical red wavelength will cause more green to appear in the
          sky at sunset.

    Blend stage configuration
  </h2>
  <p>
    Each blend stage is capable of performing the same set of operations and as such
    they are each configured independently though the same interface. As shown in the
    pipeline overview, there are 3 main configurable options to each blend stage. These
    options are the 'Blend Method', the 'ColorB', and the 'Blend Modifier', the function
    of each of these follows. When developing an application using the 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSkyMaterial</span>,
    please refer to the class documentation for the specific syntax to use when configuring
    these values.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ColorB value for each blend stage can be generated in a number of ways and each
    way has its own set of configurable options. The following table describes each
    type of color generation and the variables associated with the generation.

    for <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSkyMaterial</span> application, however, a simpler interface has been developed on
    the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSky</span> class to allow the quick construction of an environmental sky.
