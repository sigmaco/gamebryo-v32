<h1>Creating a C++ Revision Control Provider Plug-in</h1>

<p>The revision control library can be extended to support additional revision control systems. The
first step in doing the integration with a new RCS provider is to write the C++ portion of the
integration. This layer will be responsible for directly wrapping the provider to return
information like status, as well as performing the basic commands shared by all integrations.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Name the new C++ dll project "etkRCS"; + MyProvider. Only dlls that start with etkRCS will
    be scanned for RCS provider capability.</li>

    <li>The RCS Provider project contains a string table with a string resource for the 101 entry
    (the first entry), which is the user displayable name of the provider (for example,
    Subversion).</li>

    <li>The RCS Provider must contain an exported symbol to factory method used to create the new
    revision control system provider object:
        <pre>
extern "C" __declspec (dllexport) etk::RCSProvider* CreateRCS(void);

etk::RCSProvider* CreateRCS(void)
{
   return EE_NEW RCSMyProvider();
}
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>The object that is created by the factory method must inherit from <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/etkRCS/etk__RCSProvider.htm">etk::RCSProvider</a></span>. There are several
    pure virtual methods on this class that are required to be implemented.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some helpful tips when doing your RCS Provider:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Remember, revision control commands are being run after the disk IO has already occurred.
    (This is not the case for rename and delete, your integration is responsible for making sure
    the file gets renamed).</li>

    <li>Most of the logic for an RCS Provider is the same or similar for all providers when dealing
    with fallback conditions. These are the cases where a user attempts to do things like rename a
    file that is opened for add. Usually it is not possible for a provider to rename something
    before it has actually been committed. This higher-level fallback logic is handled in three
    tiers.</li>

    <li>It is okay to block in this layer; do not waste time doing things asynchronously here. The
    managed Toolbench layer that wraps this one takes care of all the non-blocking and threading
    logic to run the commands asynchronously.</li>

    <li>If your underlying RCS Provider is not thread-safe internally, you will need to wrap the
    calls in critical sections. There will be a minimum of two threads accessing your provider
    because status queries are not run on the same thread as typical commands.</li>
</ul>
