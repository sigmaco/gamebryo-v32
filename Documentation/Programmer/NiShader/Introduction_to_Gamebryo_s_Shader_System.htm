<h1>Introduction to Gamebryo's Shader System</h1>

<p>The Gamebryo <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> 
 system (or, "Gamebryo Shader System") controls how objects are rendered, 
 including their pixel and vertex shaders. <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> objects are produced from <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../NiMaterial/Introduction_to_the_NiMaterial_System.htm">NiMaterial</a></span>
 objects, which infrequently analyze object states to determine and setup 
 appropriate <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> objects. Materials and 
 shaders are integrated into the art pipeline, and are data-driven.

<p>A <em>shader</em>, in the context of Gamebryo, represents 
 a complete rendering effect to apply to an object. This definition is 
 a slight departure from the usual terminology of DirectX-based renderers.
 When rendering an object, a Gamebryo shader includes all passes and render 
 states that determine the object's rendered appearance.</p>

<p>Vertex and pixel shaders are referred to as <em>shader 
 programs</em> in Gamebryo. This definition is intended to specify the shaders 
 more clearly as to their function/purpose. A rendering pass can include 
 only a single vertex shader program and a single pixel shader program 
 (or use the fixed-function pipeline for either one of them). A Gamebryo 
 shader, or complete rendering effect, can actually utilize numerous shader 
 programs&mdash;one vertex and/or one pixel shader program per pass required 
 to achieve said effect. In general, both pixel and vertex shaders are 
 referred to as shader programs when they are not identified as either 
 pixel or vertex shaders.</p>

<p>For integration into the Gamebryo tool-chain, shaders 
 can be packaged into a <em>shader library</em> collection. These libraries 
 can support either a DLL or a static lib interface (or both, in most cases), 
 with the DLL version being required for utilization in the tools. </p>

<p>Finally, <em>binary shader</em> instances represent a 
 completely data-driven interface into the Gamebryo shader system. This 
 class provides a simple and efficient way for integrating shader technology 
 in your application, allowing for quick prototyping and debugging of shaders.</p>

<h2>For More Information</h2>

<p>Other NiShader Programmer's Guide topics cover the architecture 
 of the system in detail, as well as the integration into the renderer. 
 To really understand the way the system works, these sections are a must 
 read. The details of the Gamebryo-specific shader file (NSF) and binary 
 shader file (NSB) developer tools are also detailed in this section, as 
 well as how to use more industry-standard shader files, like FX shaders, 
 in the engine.</p>
