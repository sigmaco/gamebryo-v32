<h1>Writing your own shader-derived class</h1>

<p>Users of the Gamebryo engine can derive from a renderer-specific 
 base class, such as <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiD3DShaderInterface</span>, 
 to implement their own custom shaders. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiD3DShaderInterface</span> 
 is the interface through which the D3D renderer interacts with all shaders 
 during the rendering of objects in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">RenderXXX</span> 
 function calls. For a complete description of the rendering interface, 
 please refer to <a href="Introduction_!Renderer_Interaction.htm">Renderer Interface</a>.</p>

<p>There may be several levels to choose from when deriving 
 your own shader classes, depending on which renderer you're using. For 
 the D3D renderers, the lowest level is to derive from <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiD3DShaderInterface</span>. 
 This class requires that all functionality expected by the renderer be 
 completely implemented. While this level of implementation is the lowest 
 level at which you can interface with the renderer, it is the most difficult 
 to implement, requiring the most code to be written. There are no 'helper' 
 members available at this level, such as an array of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiD3DPass</span> 
 instances, to aid in implementing your shader. For a full breakdown of 
 the interface functions, please refer to the <a href="../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/NiDX9Renderer_Class_Reference_Intro.htm">NiDX9 Renderer Shader class reference documentation</a>. </p>

<p>The next level available of derivation available in 
 the D3D renderer is the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiD3DShader</span> 
 class. This class adds some helpful structure to the system, providing 
 several members which aid in the implementation of the renderer-required 
 functions. Packing definitions, render states, shader constant register 
 settings, and an array of passes are all provided with this class. A derived 
 class is free to fill these in as it sees fit, and let the base implementation 
 handle the run-time functions. Or, it can pick-and-choose which functions 
 it wishes to alter, such as setting an obscure transformation matrix during 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetupTransformations</span> 
 function to achieve a desired effect, but leaving the rest 'as-is'.</p>

<p>An application may also derive from <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiD3DDefaultShader</span>. 
 This class represents the legacy default Gamebryo pipeline, and implements 
 the code to analyze the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiProperty</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDynamicEffect</span> instances 
 attached to the object being rendered, setting up the required passes 
 to achieve the desired effect. There are advantages that an application 
 can leverage should they decide to derive from this level. As an example, 
 if you knew that no object in your scene will ever have projected lights 
 applied to it, you can derive from the <span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdatePipeline</span>, 
 removing the code which analyzes and sets up projected lighting effects. 
 If you have an object in the scene which requires projected lights be 
 additive, but all other Gamebryo pipeline functionality remains intact, 
 derive a new shader class for that object which handles additive projected 
 lights, and assign it accordingly. [NOTE: <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiD3DDefaultShader</span> 
 is derived from <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiD3DShader</span>.]</p>

<p>The current default pipeline uses <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9FragmentShader</span> 
 to render geometry objects. This class is actually much simpler than <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiD3DDefaultShader</span>, though that is because 
 the work to set up the render states and shaders is taken care of by the 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStandardMaterial</span> class. If you're going 
 to derive a new material from <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStandardMaterial</span> 
 or <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFragmentMaterial</span>, then you'll be 
 using <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9FragmentShader</span> objects. </p>

<p>As stated before, the system provides several levels 
 at which developers can choose to derive their shaders from. Depending 
 on their specific needs, they should be able to accomplish whatever they 
 desire with one of the three classes provided. These derived classes can 
 be compiled directly by your application, and the application can 'hand 
 attach' these instances to objects which require their usage.</p>

<p>For examples of deriving your own shader classes, as 
 well as attaching them once there are created, please refer to the <a 
 href="../../Learn/Demos/Overview_!ShaderSample.htm">ShaderSample</a> 
 documentation.</p>
