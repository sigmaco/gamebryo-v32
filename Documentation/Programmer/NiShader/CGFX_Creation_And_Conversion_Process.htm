<h1>CGFX Creation and Conversion Process</h1>

<p>NVIDIA FX Composer 2 with the PS3 Collada plugin can 
 be used to author COLLADA FX effects and materials. Effects may be authored 
 and previewed as CGFX files or as COLLADA FX (.DAE) files. </p>

<p>The Collada2NSF utility requires that effects be in 
 the COLLADA FX format with a PS3 Cg Profile. It should reference an external 
 Cg or CgFX file for Cg shader program source code.</p>

<p>For detailed instructions, please read the Getting Started 
 Guide found in the NVIDIA FX Composer 2 distribution. <a href="https://ps3.scedev.net/projects/fx_composer" target="_blank">NVIDIA 
 FX Composer 2</a> may be downloaded from PS3 Developer Network web site.</p>

<p>Gamebryo provides several examples of CGFX and COLLADA 
 FX files located in the Collada2NSF folder under the Tools folder of Gamebryo.</p>

<p><b>Disclaimer:</b>
 
 the usability of <a href="CGFX_Creation_And_Conversion_Process.htm">Collada2NSF</a> in a PS3 
 shader authoring pipeline is limited, and the tool is under review for 
 removal in a future release. Customers who do wish to use it should be 
 advised that the transposed Cg matrix format issue mentioned in <a href="../../ee_goto.htm#Reference/NiPS3Renderer/Features_and_Limitations_of_the_PS3_Renderer.htm"
>Features and Limitations of the PS3 Renderer</a> 
 means that shaders authored in FX Composer are viewable in either FX Composer 
 or Gamebryo for PS3, but not both.</p>

<h2>COLLADA FX to NSF Conversion Process</h2>

<p>Gamebryo provides a utility called <span class="NDLSystemFont">BuildShader.bat</span> 
 (located in <em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Source\Tools\Collada2NSF, not in the path by default). 
 This utility is used to convert the COLLADA FX document to a Gamebryo 
 NSF file. This utility also compiles the shaders referenced by the COLLADA 
 FX file. Using the utility simply requires specifying the name of the 
 .dae file (without the .dae extension), the source path to the file, and 
 the destination path where all generated files (NSF, .vpo, fpo) should 
 be placed. The generated NSF will contain a shader technique for every 
 material in the COLLADA FX file. This means that at least one material 
 must exist in the COLLADA FX file for the generated NSF to be valid.</p>

<p>Common issues:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>The shader source should 
 be an externally referenced file (Cg or CgFX), not embedded in the Collada 
 document.</li>
	
	<li>The profile must be 
 Cg for the converter to work correctly; it is typically Common by default. 
 &nbsp;A profile 
 can be converted in FX Composer by going to Assets View..Effects List, 
 and selecting "Convert to CgFX" from the context menu. &nbsp;This 
 has the side effect of embedding the shader source into the file, but 
 it must be external, so remove the now embedded source file and "Add 
 include" the original .cgfx file.</li>
	
	<li>Ideally, the shader 
 source file and the Collada document should be in the same directory, 
 on a path with no spaces, to prevent unwanted extra pathing or %20 characters 
 occurring in the output NSF file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that the process used to generate the NSF 
 files from COLLADA FX files is simply a transformation process, meaning 
 no error checking will be performed and the resulting NSF may not be correctly 
 parsed by Gamebryo.</p>

<h2>BuildShader.bat Example</h2>

<p>The following example shows how one would use BuildShader.bat 
 to convert WarpBars.dae into WarpBars.NSF and compile the required shaders 
 from WarpBars.cgfx to WarpBars_vmain.vpo and WarpBars_fmain.fpo. The source 
 file, WarpBars.dae is located in the examples\Eturnum directory. In this 
 example generated files (WarpBars.NSF, WarpBars_vmain.vpo, and WarpBars_fmain.fpo) 
 will be placed in the examples\Eturnum directory as well.</p>

<pre>
%EMERGENT_PATH%\Source\Tools\Collada2NSF\BuildShader.bat WarpBars examples\Eturnum examples\Eturnum
compiling: examples\Eturnum\WarpBars_vmain.vpo
examples\Eturnum/WarpBars.cgfx
207 lines, 0 warnings, 0 errors.
compiling: examples\Eturnum\WarpBars_fmain.fpo
examples\Eturnum/WarpBars.cgfx
207 lines, 0 errors.
</pre>

<p>Once this line has been executed the resulting files 
 (WarpBars.NSF, WarpBars_vmain.vpo, and WarpBars_fmain.fpo) are ready to 
 be used by the application.</p>
