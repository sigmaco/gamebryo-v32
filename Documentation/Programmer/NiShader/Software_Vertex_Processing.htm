<h1>Software Vertex Processing</h1>

<p>Most modern graphics hardware performs transform and 
 lighting of vertices in hardware, as opposed to in software. This allows 
 an significant increase in performance, and should be used for vertices 
 that use the default fixed-function pipeline in nearly every case.</p>

<p>For vertex shaders, however, there are cases where an 
 application may choose to force vertex processing to happen in software 
 rather than hardware. While the hardware performance is much faster, software 
 vertex processing usually offers more functionality than the hardware 
 version. Applications that want to make use of advanced shader models 
 may also choose to run a vertex shader through the software vertex processing 
 pipeline rather than provide a less capable vertex shader on graphics 
 hardware that can't handle the complex shader.</p>

<p>Gamebryo provides a way for applications to specify, 
 on a per-vertex-shader-basis, whether or not to use software vertex processing. 
 Applications can also explicitly switch to software processing for all 
 vertices if they choose to.</p>

<p>Important note: Software vertex processing is only available 
 through the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9Renderer</span>, 
 not the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiXenonRenderer</span>.</p>

<h2>Device Creation</h2>

<p>Before any software vertex processing can take place, 
 the Direct3D device must be created to allow it. During creation of an 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9Renderer</span> the application will need 
 to request a device that is capable of software vertex processing. The 
 place to make this selection is in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">eDesc</span> 
 parameter of the static renderer <span class="NDLSystemFont">Create</span> 
 function. Creating a renderer using <span class="NDLSystemFont">DEVDESC_PURE</span> 
 or <span class="NDLSystemFont">DEVDESC_HAL_HWVERTEX</span> will result in 
 a device that is only capable of hardware vertex processing. Similarly, 
 passing <span class="NDLSystemFont">DEVDESC_HAL_SWVERTEX</span> will return 
 a device that is only capable of software vertex processing. In either 
 of these instances, the settings on the vertex shader will be completely 
 ignored, since the device cannot switch between software and hardware 
 processing. The only value for the parameter that will result in a renderer 
 that can switch processing modes is <span class="NDLSystemFont">DEVDESC_HAL_MIXEDVERTEX</span>. 
 Refer to the documentation on <a href="../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/Creation_of_a_DX9Renderer.htm">creating 
 an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDX9Renderer</span></a> for more details. 
 By default, the a renderer created with <span class="NDLSystemFont">DEVDESC_HAL_MIXEDVERTEX</span> 
 will use hardware vertex processing, but if the renderer makes use of 
 a vertex shader created for software processing, or if the application 
 switches modes, the renderer will use software vertex processing. </p>

<h2>Vertex Shader Creation</h2>

<p>In addition to creating the device correctly, vertex 
 shaders must also be initialized for software vertex processing. Applications 
 that make use of NSF or FX shaders have only to indicate that a shader 
 implementation that uses a vertex shader either requires or is able to 
 fall back to software processing in the shader file. See the documentation 
 on <a href="NSF_File_Format_Reference.htm">NSF</a> 
 or <a href="Introduction_!FX_Shaders.htm">FX</a> shaders for more details. 
 Applications that create a vertex shader from directly may pass <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">true</span> for the <span class="NDLSystemFont">bSoftwareVP</span> 
 parameter of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiD3DShaderProgramFactory::CreateVertexShaderFromFile</span> 
 to get a software vertex shader. It is not possible to switch a vertex 
 shader from hardware mode to software mode; the choice can only be made 
 during shader creation.</p>

<p>Any vertex shader that does not explicitly require software 
 processing is considered to require hardware processing. When the renderer 
 encounters a software vertex shader, if it was created to be able to, 
 it will switch to software vertex processing for that vertex shader, and 
 then will switch back to hardware processing for any subsequent objects.</p>

<h2>Switching Processing Modes</h2>

<p>The application can also explicitly switch vertex processing 
 modes, if the renderer is able to. The function <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiD3DRenderState::SetSoftwareVertexProcessing</span> 
 can be used to explicitly enter software vertex processing mode. The renderer 
 will remain in that mode until another call to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiD3DRenderState::SetSoftwareVertexProcessing</span> 
 resets the mode to hardware vertex processing. This will cause all vertices, 
 including those using the fixed function pipeline, to use software vertex 
 processing.</p>
