<h1>NSF Shaders with HLSL Shader Programs</h1>

<p>Many of the sample NSF shaders that ship with Gamebryo 
 make use of assembly shader programs. It is perfectly valid to use HLSL 
 shader programs with NSF shaders, though, and often makes shader development 
 easier. There are some things you want to keep in mind when creating NSF 
 shaders that use HLSL shader programs.</p>

<h2>Effects Framework Elements Ignored</h2>

<p>Many files that contain HLSL code started their lives 
 as FX files, meant to be used with Microsoft's D3DX Effect framework. 
 Gamebryo does support that framework through the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiD3DXEffectShader</span> 
 library, which is described <a href="Introduction_!FX_Shaders.htm">here</a>. 
 But NSF shader files don't use that framework, so much of that extra framework 
 is ignored. This includes:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Annotations</li>
	
	<li>Semantics not directly 
 used by the shader programs (except for samplers; see below)</li>
	
	<li>Techniques</li>
	
	<li>Texture declarations</li>
	
	<li>Sampler state blocks</li>
</ul>

<p>The elements that are used include just the basics necessary 
 to compile HLSL code:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">#include</span> 
 directives</li>
	
	<li>Functions</li>
	
	<li>Structure declarations</li>
	
	<li>Variable declarations</li>
</ul>

<h2>NSF File Dominant</h2>

<p>The NSF file is what drives the shader operation, not 
 the HLSL file. Although sampler states can be described in an HLSL file 
 using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">sampler_state</span> block, they will 
 be ignored in favor of the sampler states declared in the NSF file. In 
 fact, <span class="NDLSystemFont">texture</span> objects don't even need 
 to be declared in HLSL files; only the <span class="NDLSystemFont">sampler</span> 
 objects will get used. Variables declared in HLSL files will not be set 
 at runtime unless they have associated attributes declared in the NSF 
 file, and functions in the HLSL files will not be compiled unless they 
 are used as shader programs by the NSF file (or called by other functions 
 that are).</p>

<h2>Specifying the Shader Program</h2>

<p>In NSF shaders that use assembly shader programs, it 
 is usually only necessary to specify the name of the file that contains 
 the shader program. NSF shaders that use HLSL shader programs need to 
 include more information.</p>

<p>There are two ways to declare pixel and vertex shader 
 programs in NSF files: the simple declaration, and the complete declaration. 
 Both are described in <a HREF="Shader_Programs.htm">this</a> 
 section. Remember that if the entry point is not explicitly named, it 
 is assumed to be &quot;main&quot;, and if the shader target is not specified, 
 the highest one available for the current hardware will be used.</p>

<h2>Associating NSF Samplers and HLSL Samplers</h2>

<p>One step that's not completely clear is how to match 
 up the samplers that are declared in NSF files with the samplers declared 
 in the HLSL code. After all, NSF samplers are referred to by number, while 
 HLSL samplers are variables identified only by name. The solution is to 
 explicitly link every sampler declared in an HLSL file with a numbered 
 sampler register using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">register</span> semantic. 
 </p>

<p>HLSL file:</p>

<pre>
sampler BaseSampler : register(s0);
sampler NormalSampler : register(s1);
</pre>

<p>NSF file:</p>

<pre>
Sampler 0 BaseSampler
{
    TSS_Texture     = NTM_Base
    TSAMP_AddressU  = TADDR_WRAP
    TSAMP_AddressV  = TADDR_WRAP
    TSAMP_MagFilter = TEXF_Linear
    TSAMP_MinFilter = TEXF_Linear
    TSAMP_MipFilter = TEXF_Linear
}
 
Sampler 1 NormalSampler
{
    TSS_Texture     = &lt;NormalMap&gt;
    TSAMP_AddressU  = TADDR_WRAP
    TSAMP_AddressV  = TADDR_WRAP
    TSAMP_MagFilter = TEXF_Linear
    TSAMP_MinFilter = TEXF_Linear
    TSAMP_MipFilter = TEXF_Linear
}
</pre>

<p>Remember that the name of the sampler declared in the 
 NSF file will not help you; the only way to link the HLSL sampler with 
 the NSF sampler is by using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">register</span> 
 semantic in the HLSL file. If this is not done, there is no way to ensure 
 that the texture and sampler settings that are set by the NSF shader will 
 be associated with the correct sampler in the HLSL file. </p>

<h2>Associating NSF Constant Map Entries with HLSL Variables</h2>

<p>Values from Object, Attribute, Defined, Global, and 
 Operator constant map entries can be declared in NSF files as described 
 <a href="Shader_Constant_Maps.htm">here</a>. 
 The corresponding HLSL variables will be updated with the values of all 
 such constant map entries during runtime. </p>
