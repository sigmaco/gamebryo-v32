<h1>Introduction to FX Lite Shaders</h1>

<p>Gamebryo's NiShader system is a powerful way for applications
to make use of advanced rendering techniques, and the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NSF</span>/<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NSB</span> system makes it easy to write advanced
shaders and integrate their development into the art pipeline.
The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiD3DXEffectShaderLib</span>
extends that ease of use by allowing developers to use
Microsoft's Effect file format to create Gamebryo shaders just as
they would use <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSF</span> files. On
Xbox 360, however, the D3DX Effects libraries are not highly
optimized. FX Lite provides an alternative for writing effects
that is much higher performance. Developers can access FX Lite
with Gamebryo by using the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiFXLShaderLib</span> library. Because the
library is based on Gamebryo's <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> architecture, it would be useful
to read the <a href=
"Introduction_to_Gamebryo_s_Shader_System.htm">documentation</a>
for the system before trying to understand this implementation of
the system.</p>

<p>When the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFXLShaderLib</span>
library is linked with an application, the application treats any
.<span class="NDLSystemFont">FXL</span> and .<span class="NDLSystemFont">FXLO</span> files it finds as it
would treat an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSB</span> file, and
creates a Gamebryo shader library representing that file,
containing all the techniques in that file as shaders. An
application can request a shader from the library, which will
create an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFXLShader</span> that
encapsulates everything that is needed to render an object with a
given technique. By making use of the annotations that the D3D
Effect format provides, the parameters in the technique can be
linked to Gamebryo data, just as is possible with <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NSF</span>/<span class="NDLSystemFont">NSB</span>
files. In addition, the library provides the same data to the
artist's tools that the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NSF</span>/<span class="NDLSystemFont">NSB</span>
files do, allowing effects contained in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FX</span> files to be integrated into the art
pipeline to the same degree.</p>

As with all custom shaders, customers are encouraged to use pre-compiled shaders for their
shipping application to help reduce load time. Below is an example of how to use the FXC
shader compiler that ships with the Xbox 360 XDK to pre-compile an FXL shader:

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">fxc.exe /Tfxl_3_0 /Fo ExampleShader.fxlo ExampleShader.fxl</span></p>
