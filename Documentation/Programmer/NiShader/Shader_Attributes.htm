<h1>Shader Attributes</h1>

<p>NSF files allow you to set shader attributes that are either
global to the shader system or that are attached to the object as
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiExtraData</span> subclasses. The
fragment below shows several global and local attributes for the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">BaseBumpWithSpatialGlow</span>
shader.</p>

<pre>
Global_Attributes
{
    Attrib_Point4   GlowLightPosition    Hidden  0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0
}

Objects
{
    Effect_GeneralLight   0   Light1
    Effect_GeneralLight   1   Light2
}

Attributes
{
    //Constants for the light.
    Attrib_Point4
        GlowAttenuation
        Artist
        1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 200.0
        [(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) (1.0, 1.0, 10.0, 10000.0)]
    //The normal map for the bump mapping.

<h2>Distinction Between Global and Local Attributes</h2>

<p>It is important to make the distinction between when you use
global versus local attributes. Global attributes will be shared
across all instances of any shader that has a global attribute of
the same name. Local attributes are directly attached to the
object that the shader is attached to in the art package.
Regardless of type, attributes will not be sent to the graphics
hardware unless they are specified in the shader constant map of
the NSF file.</p>

<p>Because of the differences in behavior between global and
local attributes, they are both suited for different tasks.
Global attributes work well for pieces of information that
represent world state data. In the above fragment, the global
attributes are used to store lighting information. Local
attributes are useful for information that may change on a
per-object basis. For example, the normal map in the shader above
is a local attribute since it may be different on every surface
that the shader is applied to. Additionally, local attributes may
be animated in the art packages and exported with the NIF file.
There is no way to control global attributes in the art
packages.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Attributes for Proper Use in Art Packages</h2>

<p>The NSF format allows local attributes to appear selectively
in the art packages. The keywords "Artist" and "Hidden" control
this behavior. As seen above, both of the local attributes are
available to the artist. All of the global attributes are
specified as hidden although this is a bit redundant since you
cannot access global attributes in the art packages.
Additionally, a default value and sometimes a range can be
specified for an attribute. It is critical to set meaningful
defaults for global attributes. The default value for a global
attribute is the only one available in the art packages.</p>

<p>For some data types, primarily the numeric ones, the shader
author can specify a range of values for any local attributes.
Artists cannot set local attributes to any value outside of that
range. As seen above, the X value for <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GlowAttenuation</span> cannot be set outside of a
range from 0.0 to 1.0. Using intelligent ranges can help you
optimize your shader program code. For example, since the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">GlowAttenuation</span> values must
fall in the positive range, there is no reason to check for
negative values in the shader program code with the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">max</span> instruction. Also note that the range
restrictions of a shader apply only to the art packages.
Application code can set local attributes to any value that the
programmer chooses.</p>

<p>Using these properties of attributes carefully allows a shader
author to make efficient shaders that are easy for artists to
use. Observing the following rules will maximize your
performance, memory usage, and artist experience.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Explain the usage of any artist visible attributes in the
    shader description.</li>

    <li>Do not place hidden attributes on an object unless you
    application intends to change them. Otherwise, you will have
    duplicate copies of <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiExtraData</span> objects occupying
    memory.</li>

    <li>Global attributes that will not change of the course of
    an application should be coded directly into the constant map
    of the NSF. See <a href="Constant_Maps.htm">Constant Maps</a>
    for details.</li>

    <li>Remember that globals sharing names across shaders will
    also share data. This sharing can be used to create
    consistent lighting throughout an application.</li>

    <li>Do not have two globals of differing types with the same
    name. This duplication can cause name collisions and
    unpredictable behavior.</li>
</ul>
