<h1>Cube Maps and Shader Programs</h1>

<p>There are some special considerations that must be taken 
 when writing shader programs that make use of cube maps in Gamebryo. The 
 problem is that Direct3D uses a left-handed coordinate system, while Gamebryo 
 uses a right-handed coordinate system. For the most part, this has no 
 effect on writing shader programs: transforms, lighting calculations, 
 texture lookups, and nearly all other calculations will work the same 
 whether the space is left-handed or right-handed, as long as the Gamebryo-provided 
 projection matrix will take care of the conversion when the vertices are 
 written to screen space. For this reason, nearly all shader programs can 
 be used by Gamebryo directly as written.</p>

<p>One exception to this fact comes up when dealing with 
 cube maps. Because of the difference in coordinate systems between Direct3D 
 and Gamebryo, the way Direct3D organizes cube maps is somewhat different 
 than the way Gamebryo organizes them. This means that when using <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiSourceCubeMap.htm">NiSourceCubeMap</a></span> 
 or <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderedCubeMap.htm">NiRenderedCubeMap</a></span> 
 objects, the lookup needs to be slightly different. When using the fixed 
 function pipeline to do reflection mapping, Gamebryo automatically compensates 
 for the difference by passing in a texture transform to correct for the 
 problem. But when using vertex shaders, there's no way Gamebryo can automatically 
 compensate. For this reason, the vertex shader will need to correct the 
 problem itself.</p>

<p>The way to correct the problem is to swizzle the vector 
 used to look up into the cube map using the swizzle <span class="NDLSystemFont">.xzy</span>. 
 Often, this can be done simply when looking up the cube map in the pixel 
 shader. But in some situations, including the Glass.hlsl shader and the 
 Chrome.fx shaders that ship with Gamebryo, the pixel shaders cannot be 
 altered in that manner. In those cases, the vertex shader will need to 
 swizzle the vector itself, and pass the result to the pixel shader. This 
 often requires swizzling the other vectors that will be used with that 
 vector, though, since all calculations will need to be done in the same 
 space.</p>
