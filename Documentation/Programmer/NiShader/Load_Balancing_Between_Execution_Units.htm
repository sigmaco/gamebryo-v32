<h1>Load Balancing Between Execution Units</h1>

<p>Prior to the advent of hardware assisted transform and 
 lighting, game profiling was primarily an issue of CPU efficiency and 
 core system resources. Once GPUs began to assume more functionality, it 
 became critical to balance the amount of work done on each. When developing 
 an application with shader-driven assets, load balancing between execution 
 units can become an even greater issue than before. While GPU limited 
 applications were generally either vertex engine limited (transform bound) 
 or pixel engine limited (fill rate bound), shaders and shader programs 
 provide a much more flexible way to balance between the two types of GPU 
 constraints. Applications should consider ways to make sure the CPU and 
 GPU are working to their full potential. </p>

<p>The following suggestions are primarily aimed at applications 
 that rely heavily on pixel and vertex shader programs. Note also, that 
 these discussions are simplified. Bottlenecks can also occur in a number 
 of places not mentioned herein. Developers who run into bottlenecks with 
 shaders are encouraged to check the developer sites of major hardware 
 vendors for more in-depth optimization tips.</p>

<h2>Determining the Bottleneck</h2>

<p>Determining precisely where your application is limited 
 can be a difficult task on PC based platforms. Profiling the CPU is fairly 
 simple using various commercially available profilers. Determining GPU 
 bottlenecks is somewhat more difficult and must be approached in a roundabout 
 manner. The general approach is to add or remove computation to one phase 
 of the pipeline and determine the overall effect on the frame rate. Note 
 also, that these are not the only places where your application could 
 be bottlenecked. They are just the most common. For more information on 
 performance profiling in general, please refer to the <a href="../General_Topics/Profiling_Overview.htm">profiling 
 documentation</a>. On PC, you can additionally get more information from 
 some tools such as NVPerfHUD as explained in <a href="../General_Topics/SwapBuffers_Slowdowns.htm">our 
 documentation.</a></p>

<p>To test for vertex engine limited applications, you 
 can try adding vertex engine complexity or try decreasing the number of 
 textures applied. Duplicating calculations in vertex shaders can increase 
 vertex engine complexity. If the frame rate decreases as you add complexity, 
 the application is likely vertex engine bound. </p>

<p>To test for pixel engine limited applications, you can 
 try decreasing the render window resolution or try adding additional pixel 
 engine complexity. If decreasing the size of the render window increases 
 the frame rate, it is likely that your application is bound, at least 
 some part of the time, in the pixel engine. If the frame rate remains 
 constant, you are more likely bound in the vertex engine or CPU. If adding 
 additional pixel engine complexity, such as extraneous instructions in 
 pixel shaders, affects the frame rate, then it is likely that the application 
 is pixel engine bound.</p>

<h2>Options for CPU Bound Applications</h2>

<p>With programmable shaders, applications can begin to 
 offload certain calculations onto the GPU. Use this to your advantage. 
 Consider using shaders for traditional CPU activities like morphing. Also, 
 using shaders can optimize CPU usage by reducing the number of function 
 calls and by reducing bus utilization. For example, the default, fixed 
 function pipeline uses four bones per partition when executing hardware 
 assisted skinning. This results in extra partitions and extra calls to 
 the associated DirectX methods for rendering. A custom shader with more 
 bones per partition would reduce to fewer partitions resulting in fewer 
 calls to DirectX.</p>

<h2>Options for Vertex Engine Bound Applications</h2>

<p>Vertex engine bound applications can gain performance 
 by caching calculations on the CPU or by caching calculations in textures 
 for use in the pixel engine. Applications with multipass effects on complex 
 models are very likely to be vertex engine limited. For objects with several 
 passes that are skinned, software skinning can be more efficient than 
 hardware skinning. An application should determine this by analyzing available 
 CPU time and GPU restrictions. With software skinning, the skinning calculations 
 are executed once on the CPU and cached for GPU use. Hardware assisted 
 skinning would repeat these calculations in the fixed function pipeline 
 or vertex shader for each pass. </p>

<p>Another way to ease the burden on the vertex engine 
 is to cache calculations in textures and use those textures in the pixel 
 engine. For example, you could use a normal map and perform lighting calculations 
 per pixel in a pixel shader instead of per vertex in a vertex shader. 
 This approach would remove the need to pass the normals through the vertex 
 shader and would eliminate any lighting code from the vertex engine. Additionally, 
 model tessellation could possibly be reduced since the normal information 
 in the normal map would account for some of the detail. This decrease 
 in the number of vertices would further decrease the burden on the vertex 
 engine.</p>

<h2>Options for Pixel Engine Bound Applications</h2>

<p>Applications that are bound in the pixel engine are 
 typically the most difficult to address without somewhat modifying the 
 look of an application. First, consider moving calculations up to the 
 vertex engine and let the graphics hardware interpolate the results during 
 rasterization. This optimization can be difficult if the information used 
 in the pixel engine is sampled from a texture since most graphics hardware 
 has no way to sample a texture in the vertex engine. Also, calculations 
 that do not vary linearly across a triangle will produce odd visual results 
 if they are moved back into the vertex engine and interpolated.</p>

<p>Modern graphics hardware is designed to optimize at 
 the pixel level by rejecting pixels based on their z-buffer value at the 
 top of the pixel pipeline. This optimization works best when objects are 
 drawn in a roughly front to back order. Consider writing a sorter that 
 does this if you are pixel engine bound. Also, the use of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">texkill 
 </span>or <span class="NDLSystemFont">texdepth</span> instructions 
 in pixel shader programs can force the graphics hardware to turn off pixel 
 rejection at the top of the pipeline. Consider usage of these instructions 
 very carefully. Very heavily pixel engine bound applications may benefit 
 from a two pass rendering algorithm where the first pass writes the z-buffer 
 and subsequent passes only test against that value.</p>

<p>Pixel engine bound applications may also have texture 
 bandwidth issues. Decreasing texture size or filtering modes can address 
 these issues. Consider decreasing texture resolution where possible and 
 consider turning off trilinear filtering where not absolutely necessary. 
 Often, textures other than base maps do not need trilinear filtering enabled. 
 Developers should try disabling trilinear filtering on certain textures 
 to obtain a balance between performance and appearance.</p>
