<h1>Exposing your ShaderLibrary to the tool-chain </h1>

<p>Having the tool-chain recognize your shader libraries 
 give you several advantages as a Gamebryo developer. The first advantage 
 is the ability to stream the shader you wish to apply to an object out 
 as part of the scene. Provided the proper library is registered with your 
 application when it runs, the shader will be attached appropriately when 
 the object is streamed in. To put it another way, developers will not 
 have to do anything programmatically to attach shaders to objects once 
 they have written a shader library.</p>

<p>The second advantage is through the exposure of 'tweakable' 
 attributes that the artist can adjust to make the effect more appealing. 
 This capability is accomplished through the shader system's usage of <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../../Reference/NiMain/NiExtraData.htm">NiExtraData</a></span> 
 attached to geometry instances. Your shader can present custom attributes 
 to assign to an object that is mapped into the shader constant registers. 
 These values will be exported as part of the object, and can be adjusted 
 by the artist to allow them the ability to tweak values with an artistic 
 eye. These attributes can be adjusted as part of an animation cycle, giving 
 the artist the ability to animate shader effects. </p>

<p>As an example, consider a spell effect on a character 
 which produces a halo around the model during the casting of the spell. 
 The shader author can write the shader to render the halo, and expose 
 the color of the halo to be used as an artist attribute and assign it 
 an initial color. A parameter that sets the size of the halo is also exposed 
 as part of this example. When the artist assigns the given shader to an 
 object, the color and size parameters will be added to the to the Shader 
 Parameters section of the material editor in their modeling tool. The 
 artist proceeds to animate the character casting the spell, having the 
 halo expand by animating the halo size value, and has the color go from 
 a muted white to a full blown fiery red as the spell reaches its peak. 
 To end the spell, he has the halo size reduce back to zero, and the color 
 fades to black. When this character is exported, the shader name and animated 
 parameters are exported along with him. When the game is played and the 
 animation on this character is run, the shader will automatically use 
 the animated parameters to display the effect with no programmer-required 
 code beyond writing the shader to perform the halo.</p>

<p>A third advantage is that the system allows artists 
 and designers to preview the objects with EXACTLY the same rendering pipeline 
 they will see in your game. This approach provides a potentially large 
 boost to development efficiency, since the artist will not be subjected 
 to the &quot;model - export - view - repeat&quot; pattern to see shader 
 effects on an object.</p>

<p>To have the tool-chain recognize your shader library, 
 you must follow some rules when creating it.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>You must include <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShaderLibraryInterface.h</span>. This file defines the functions that
    your library will need to export.</li>
	
	<li>You must 
 implement DLL-builds. The tool-chain will only operate with a DLL build 
 of a shader library, and this arrangement also allows for the tools to 
 operate without requiring a recompile when the shader library changes.</li>
	
	<li>You must 
 implement the <span class="NDLSystemFont">LoadShaderLibrary</span> 
 function - the prototype is located in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShaderLibraryInterface.h</span> 
 file in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Source\CoreRuntime\EngineLibs\NiMain</span>. 
 (In binary installations: This file can be found in the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\sdk\Win32\Include</span> 
 folder.) This function is responsible for creating an instance of the 
 library and returning it to the caller.</li>
	
	<li>Your class 
 derived from <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../../Reference/NiMain/NiShaderLibrary.htm">NiShaderLibrary</a></span> 
 must implement the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShaderLibrary::GetShaderLibraryDesc</span> 
 function. This is the function that tells the art tools about the shaders 
 in the library, so it must return a valid <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../../Reference/NiMain/NiShaderLibraryDesc.htm">NiShaderLibraryDesc</a></span> 
 object that contains an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../../Reference/NiMain/NiShaderDesc.htm">NiShaderDesc</a></span> 
 for every shader the library provides.</li>
	
	<li>The output 
 DLL extension must be of the proper format. For DX9-based builds, the file name for 
        Shipping builds must end in '<span class="NDLSystemFont">.sl9</span>', so the name should be <span class="NDLSystemFont">*.sl9</span>. 
        Release builds must be named <span class="NDLSystemFont">*.nl9</span>, and Debug builds must be named <span class="NDLSystemFont">*.dl9</span>.</li>
	
	<li>The resulting library must be placed in the proper directory.  By default, this directory is:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\SDK\Win32\DLL\ShaderLibs\VC#</span></p>

    <p>...where &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">VC#</span>&quot; is
     &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">VC80</span>&quot;for libraries built under Visual Studio 2005 
        and &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">VC90</span>&quot;for libraries built under Visual 
        Studio 2008.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>An example of a programmatic shader library 
 that has been exposed to the tool chain is the <a HREF="../../Learn/Demos/ShaderLibrary.htm">ShaderLibrary</a> 
 library in the <a HREF="../../Learn/Demos/Overview.htm">ShaderSample</a> 
 sample.</p>
