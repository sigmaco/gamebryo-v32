<h1>Integrating FX Lite Shaders</h1>

<p>FX Lite shaders integrate with Gamebryo much like D3DX Effects
shaders. Because of differences in FX Lite as opposed to D3DX
Effects, shaders must be authored slightly differently. This
document outlines the major differences between the two
libraries. For a full reference of values that can be used for
annotations, please refer to <a href=
"Integrating_D3D_Effect_Files.htm">Integrating D3D Effect
Files</a>.</p>

<h2>Semantic Values Are Not Available</h2>

<p>In FX Lite, a variable is has a name or a semantic, but not
both. By default, the compiler replaces any variable name with
the semantic if specified. In the Gamebryo library, this behavior
is overridden by passing the
D3DXSHADER_FXLPARAMETERS_AS_VARIABLE_NAMES flag into the
compilation of the effect. Because of this, there is no semantic
information provided to the system. Since the default D3DX
Effects integration uses semantic values for many bindings,
extensions have been made to the system to allow FX Lite shaders
to specify similar information.</p>

<h3>VarType</h3>

<p>For FX Lite, variables should be typed by the VarType
annotation as noted below.</p>
<pre>
float4 Velocity
&lt;
    string VarType = "Global";
&gt;;
</pre>

<p>Possible values for VarType are:</p>

<!--(Table)=========================================================-->

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>VarType Annotation</th>

            <th>Gamebryo Variable Type</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Attribute</td>

            <td>A per-object attribute applied to the object via
            NiExtraData. This annotation functions the same as
            the ": ATTRIBUTE" semantic.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Global</td>

            <td>A global attribute that applies to all objects in
            the scene. This annotation functions the same as the
            ": GLOBAL" semantic.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Predefined</td>

            <td>A predefined constant such as the projection
            matrix or specular material color. These values were
            accessed via individual semantics such as ":
            PROJECTION" under D3DX Effects. In FX Lite, you
            should use the VarType annotation in conjunction with
            the DefinedMapping annotation.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Object</td>

            <td>A property from an object from the dynamic effect
            state such as a light or projected texture. These
            values were accessed via individual semantics such as
            ":POSITION" under D3DX Effects. In FX Lite, you
            should use the VarType annotation in conjunction with
            the ObjectProperty annotation.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>DefinedMapping</h3>

<p>Since semantic values can no longer be used to indicate
predefined constants, this annotation is used instead. For
example, the following code indicated the combined world, view,
and projection matrices under D3DX Effects.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">float4x4 WorldViewProj :
WORLDVIEWPROJECTION;</span></p>

<p>To get the same matrix in FX Lite, use the following code.</p>
<pre>
float4x4 WorldViewProj
&lt;
    string VarType = "Predefined";
    string DefinedMapping = "WORLDVIEWPROJECTION";
&gt;
</pre>

<p>A full listing of the possible <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">DefinedMapping</span> strings can be found
<a href=
"Integrating_D3D_Effect_Files.htm#PredefinedShaderConstantEntries">
here</a>.</p>

<h3>ObjectProperty</h3>

<p>Since semantic values can no longer be used to indicate object
properties, this annotation is used instead. For example, the
following code indicated the position from the first light on an
object under D3DX Effects.</p>
<pre>
float4 LightPos : Position
&lt;
    string Object = "GeneralLight";
    int ObjectIndex = 0;
&gt;;
</pre>

<p>To get the same value in FX Lite, use the following code.</p>
<pre>
float4 LightPos
&lt;
    string VarType = "Object";
    string ObjectProperty = "Position";
    string Object = "GeneralLight";
    int ObjectIndex = 0;
&gt;;
</pre>

<h2>Texture Objects Are Not Available</h2>

<p>In FX Lite, there are no texture objects. All annotations that
users would previously have applied to texture objects should now
be applied to the sampler.</p>

<h2>Semantic Adapter Tables</h2>

<p>A <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiSemanticAdapterTable.htm">semantic
adapter table</a> is the mechanism used to wire data streams on a
mesh to varying parameters required by a shader.  There is a
default mechanism that will wire 'standard' named data streams to
corresponding FXL semantics, but a custom semantic adapter table
can also be specified per technique via a special annotation. 
For more information, see the corresponding <a href=
"Specifying_Semantic_Adapter_Tables_in_FX_Shaders.htm">page</a>
for FX shaders, as the syntax is identical.</p>

<h2>Creating Cross-Platform FXL Files</h2>

<p>Because all the annotation extensions needed for using FX Lite
shaders exist in the D3DX Effects shader lib as well, it is
possible to write cross-platform .FXL files for use with
different shader libraries on different platforms. The following
guidelines should be adhered to for compatibility and
performance.</p>

<h3>Annotate Textures and Samplers Identically</h3>

<p>Since texture objects do not exist in FX Lite, you must
annotate both textures and samplers. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiFXLShaderLib</span> will read the annotations
from textures while <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiD3DXEffectShaderLib</span> will read the
annotations from textures. The following code will work for a
base map under both libraries.</p>
<pre>
texture BaseMap
&lt;
    string NTM = "base";
&gt;;
sampler BaseSampler
&lt;
    string NTM = "base";
&gt; = sampler _state {
    texture = (BaseMap);
};
</pre>

<h3>Define Out Unused Techniques</h3>

<p>FX Lite is designed to be a high-performance run time targeted
to the known capabilities of the Xbox 360. Therefore, it makes no
sense to have fallback techniques. When creating cross-platform
techniques, however, it may be desirable to have fallback
techniques for PC platforms. Gamebryo defines the macro
GAMEBRYO_USE_D3DX_FALLBACKS when compiling for PC. Users may
comment out unused techniques with the preprocessor to avoid the
overhead of creating them when they are unneeded. For example,
the following code comments out the shader version 2.0 technique
on Xbox 360 because it is known that the 3.0 compilation will
succeed. On PC, the two techniques would both be created.</p>
<pre>
technique BasicShader
&lt;
    int implementation = 0;
&gt;
{
    pass P0
    {
        VertexShader = compile vs_3_0 VSMain();
        PixelShader = compile ps_3_0 PSMain();
    }
}
#if defined(GAMEBRYO_USE_D3DX_FALLBACKS)
technique BasicShaderLowerVersion
&lt;
    string shadername = "BasicShader";
    int implementation = 1;
&gt;
{
    pass P0
    {
        VertexShader = compile vs_2_0 VSMain();
        PixelShader = compile ps_2_0 PSMain();
    }
}
#endif
</pre>
