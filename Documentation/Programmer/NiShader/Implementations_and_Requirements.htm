<h1>Implementations and Requirements</h1>

<p>The NSF format allows multiple implementations of a shader in
a single file. Each implementation can be named and have a set of
requirements all its own. Our sample shader only has one
implementation, but it will suffice for discussion.</p>

<pre>
Implementation VS11_PS14
{
    "This implementation requires hardware that supports
    vertex shader v1.1 and pixel shader v1.4"

    Requirements
    {
        VSVersion   = v1.1
        UserVersion = v0.0
        PSVersion   = v1.4
        UsesNIRenderState = true
        BinormalTangentMethod = NBTMethod_ATI
    }

    PackingDef  PosNormUV0BinormalTangent
</pre>

<h2>Descriptions</h2>

<p>Implementations contain brief descriptions regarding the
specifics of the implementation. These descriptions are visible
to the artist. Use them to explain the differences between
implementations. Artists can specify that a file use the best
shader for the available hardware, but they can also select the
implementation to use. Because of this flexibility, it is
imperative that the artists have full information in the
implementation description of the differences between the
implementations.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Within the implementation there is a list of requirements that
must be met for that implementation. These requirements help the
shader system determine which implementation to use when the
artist specifies that the best for the hardware should be used.
There are a few considerations with requirements.</p>

<p>Make sure that you accurately encode version numbers. If you
accidentally put ps.1.3 when your pixel shader program is written
in ps.1.4, you may select an incorrect implementation at runtime.
It is up to the shader author to ensure that the shader program
version requirements are accurate. The runtime engine will assume
that the NSF requirements indicate what version the shader code
expects. Use v0.0 for shader program versions that rely on the
fixed function pipeline.</p>

<p>User version is provided to allow applications to define
additional restrictions beyond shader program version. Its use is
entirely up to the application developer.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">BinormalTangentMethod</span>
requirement serves two purposes. First, it indicates to the tool
chain that normal, binormal, and tangent vectors (NBTs) need to
be created. The NBT method dictates which algorithm will be used
in the art pipeline. Second, in debug builds, this flag is
checked against the geometry at runtime to ensure that the NBT
method matches. Note well that this check is not performed in
release mode.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">BonesPerPartition</span>
requirement is not shown above, but it functions much as the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">BinormalTangentMethod</span>
requirement. It is checked at runtime and overrides settings in
the art pipeline as well.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">UsesNiRenderState</span> affects
the way that render states are set. See the note in the <a href=
"Render_States.htm#UsesNIRenderState">following section</a>.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">UsesNiLightState</span> is not
shown as a requirement above. It functions much like <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UsesNiRenderState</span> but affects whether the
default light manager updates the lights on the hardware.
Applications that use fixed function vertex processing with
lighting should set this value to true.</p>

<p>Software vertex processing is enabled using two requirements:
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SoftwareVPRequired</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SoftwareVPFallback</span>.
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SoftwareVPRequired</span> is used
when the shader is meant to run only using software vertex
processing. <span class="NDLSystemFont">SoftareVPFallback</span>
is used when the shader should be run in hardware whenever
possible, but that if the hardware cannot handle the shader, it
is acceptable to run the shader in software. Note that in both
these instances, the device must have been created to be able to
process vertices in software - either as a software-only device,
or as a mixed device capable of switching between software and
hardware vertex processing.</p>

<h2>Packing Definition</h2>

<p>Each implementation specifies a packing definition to use.
Because different versions of a shader may require different
information, you can specify multiple packing definitions and
select at the implementation level. For example, this packing
definition uses NBTs in the vertex shader to do normal mapping in
tangent space. If the normal mapping were done in object space in
a second implementation we would not need the binormal or tangent
vectors and hence would not want to pack them in a second packing
definition for that implementation.</p>
