<h1>How entity interaction works</h1>

<p>When an interaction request (Event) arrives at an Entity, the Entity must have implemented the
Behavior named in the request. This checking is performed at arrival time. It is not generally
possible to check the type of the target Entity before sending the request, particularly if the
request is an environmental request which goes to one or more Entities. Using a Model as an
Interface, it becomes easier to indicate that an Entity can be interacted with in a particular way
by mixing in that interface Model, then implementing the specialized (or leaving the default)
logic. This approach makes it convenient to just make the request and have all Entities respond
that are capable of responding, instead of having the sender query for Entities by type, or iterate
them and check for capabilities.</p>

<p>Performing an interaction requires several steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Create the request event, often by calling the built-in to send a Behavior request. This
    involves passing parameters by streaming them into a data-stream object.</li>

    <li>Route the request message to the appropriate Scheduler service</li>

    <li>Schedule the event to be executed based on a delay time if applicable</li>

    <li>Identify Entities subscribed to the Category of the event</li>

    <li>Invoke the matching Behavior on each of those matching Entities.</li>

    <li>Execute the code in the Behavior, possibly taking more than one tick if the scripted
    behavior runs a wait-for built-in.</li>

    <li>Optionally return a response to the caller.</li>
</ol>

<p>Behavior parameters are managed by explicitly placing them into a data-stream. This allows any
number and any type of parameter to be transmitted or returned. Care must be taken, as in most
scripting languages, that the parameters are correctly provided and interpreted. Note that errors
become a runtime concern, rather than a compile or edit time concern.</p>

<p>System Services and built-ins are used to look up Entities or Categories to be interacted with.
Examples would include environmental, scene graph, or terrain services that are keeping track of
the position of Entities. The Entity Manager Service keeps track of all Entity instances and can be
queried for Entities of a given type (having a given Model mixed in), or other lookup key.</p>

<p>Built-ins exist for Behaviors to inspect the metadata of other Entities by querying about the
Property and Behavior descriptors of a given Model. This can be used to decide whether a target
Entity is appropriate to interact with. For example, a caller may inspect an Entity to see if it
has a Behavior named "Action_*", perhaps matching "Action_Sit" or "Action_Open" to indicate the
target can be sat upon or opened. This approach can be used by an AI planning system or dynamic
user menu system.</p>

<p>Interactions may consume multiple ticks and many steps. For example, an attack-run might require
refueling, transit to the target, aligning, strafe, and egress. Multiple Entities will be involved
in this interaction, including a tanker, anti-air weapons, target entity, and so on. The
interaction may be a linear, uninterpretable sequence, or may have several logic branches. But
eventually the sequence will complete, marking the end of the interaction after which the Entity
goes idle. This is a fairly common pattern: a longer term interaction occurs, many Behaviors and
events are executed, then the interaction finishes and the participating Entities go idle.</p>

<p>Some interactions are apparently spontaneous, such as collision. The physics system would invoke
the interaction, probably on each Entity that is involved. This approach is event-oriented, driven
by the processing of the physics system, as opposed to ticking each Entity and having the Entity
itself determine proximity each tick. Once the interaction is invoked, the Entity can then react in
any appropriate way, such as trading blows, affecting hit points, or playing special effects.</p>

<p>Some Entities are considered "inactive" and do not execute Behaviors. However these Entities may
have a changeable state. For example, a tree may be whole or burned. To interact in that situation,
a Behavior on another Entity would directly modify the state of the target. It may be more
appropriate to make the tree active, and create a doBurn Behavior, allowing many trees to be
affected by one environment interaction. It would certainly localize the logic about when burning
would occur instead of copying it to many bits of code that might be causes of the damage.</p>
