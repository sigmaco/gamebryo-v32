<h1>Entity interaction overview</h1>

<p>An entity can interact with another entity in three ways: by directly reading and writing
    properties, by executing behavior events, or through pre-defined interactions provided
    by services.</p>

<p>Often, the logical or programming interaction between entities performing some kind of joint
    action is done point-to-point. For example setting some initial conditions on a newly created
    entity. Some game actions will be point-to-point as well, such as a directed attack. This
    suggests that not all Behaviors are game "actions;" some are for utility purposes. A sender
    uses the target's egf::EntityID to address either kind of point-to-point Behavior invocation
    request.</p>

<p>The system also supports point-to-multipoint interaction which can be used for area of effect
    or environmental game actions. Using a predefined egf::Category (for example, a category that
    corresponds to a given room), the sender can address a Behavior invocation to all Entities
    that have subscribed to that category. An example of this would be detonate-grenade,
    follow-me, or a heal-party spell.</p>

<p>Public game actions that can be observed by more than one other Entity should use the
    point-to-multipoint form of Behavior invocation. Even if the other entities are not directly
    affected by the requested Behavior (for example, some entities in the blast area for a grenade
    effect might not take damage) they may want to react to the fact that nearby entities are
    taking damage. For example, a nearby entity may turn at the sound of the grenade, the shot, or
    the death-scream. Another use of this facility would be for a client to receive notification
    of actions between non-player entities in order to display their visual effects.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways for an entity to request a behavior invocation. Behaviors are most
    commonly triggered by sending an event message (egf::EventMessage) to an entity.  Events can be
    sent to another entity or an entity can send an event to itself. An optional delay time
    can be specified to perform the event in the future. Sending an event is an asynchronous request
    so the caller will immediately continue execution. An event may optionally provide a callback
    behavior which will be invoked on the sending entity when the target entity has finished
    executing the event behaviors. Finally, the caller can choose to block until the target
    completes the requested behavior. With these approaches, Entities can easily coordinate their
    activities.  All of these types of event request can be invoked on an entity from a scripted
    Behavior, from a built-in Behavior, or from a system service or other generic C++ code.</p>

<p>All entities in one process will execute their behaviors serially (in other words, behaviors
    effectively run single-threaded).  This allows a designer to very simply implement behaviors
    without considering complex timing issues. You are guaranteed that no other behavior code will
    run during a behavior unless it explicitly blocks using a &quot;wait-for&quot; type built-in.</p>

<p>With asynchronous behavior invocation, you must be aware that there can be time delays (even
    just a single tick), and property values on the involved entities may have changed in the
    meantime. This is a good reason to include parameters in the behavior request.</p>
    
<p>Pre-defined interaction modes exist for cases in which the message passing delay is
    unacceptable. For example, a weapon entity that is picked up and wielded
    by a character must exactly track the motion of the character's hand, without lag in
    position updating. See the
    <a href="entity_interaction_examples.htm">Entity Interaction Examples</a> page for
    an example of this.
</p>

<p>You should treat the Game Framework as an event-oriented system. Instead of having one entity
    try to loop, block or wait until some specified action occurs, it is better to have the
    other entity send a notification event that the action has completed. One exception to this is
    using the blocking Behavior request, where it becomes easy to know when a target completes
    the requested action.</p>
