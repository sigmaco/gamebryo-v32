<h1>Creating NiSourceTexture Objects</h1>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiSourceTexture.htm">NiSourceTexture</a></span> 
 objects are created from either an image filename or a block of <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span>. 
 The creation steps are different for the two methods and are described 
 below.</p>

<h2>Creating NiSourceTexture Objects from Filenames</h2>

<p>When an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture</span> 
 object is created from a filename using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture::Create</span> 
 function that takes a string as its required argument, that texture object 
 then represents the data in that file. The file may be of any format supported 
 by the current image converter object (see the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiImageConverter.htm">NiImageConverter</a></span> or 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiDevImageConverter.htm">NiDevImageConverter</a></span> 
 for details).</p>

<p>Note that applications may reference different texture 
 image files with a single filename at load time by enabling and configuring 
 platform-specific filename processing. This feature allows the application 
 to save multiple sets of image data in different subdirectories, each 
 formatted for a different platform. See the section below on platform-specific 
 loading of images.</p>

<p>Once the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture</span> 
 is created, the filename cannot be changed&mdash;the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture</span> 
 represents that image file for its entire lifespan. Texture image files 
 may need power of two pixel dimensions in some cases, depending on the 
 level of renderer support. By default, the system does not keep a system-memory, 
 renderer-independent version of this data, as the image file itself can 
 form the backing store. However, applications can force a such a representation 
 to be loaded for perusal or modification using the function <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture::LoadPixelDataFromFile</span>.</p>

<h2>Creating NiSourceTexture Objects from NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData 
 Objects</h2>

<p>Platform-specific texture capabilities enable platform-specific 
 source texture renderer data to be loaded directly into a renderer-specific 
 resource at application load time, with the result that no texture format 
 conversions are required at load time.</p>

<p>These capabilities operate on the principle of streaming
 persistent versions of source texture renderer data
 (<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData.htm">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</a></span>)
 to support platform-specific texture format conversions for "internal
 textures" (those included in a scene's NIF file) at export time.</p>

<p>Assuming that the specific platform can support the pixel
 format in question at application load time, the renderer will load the
 persistent source texture renderer data directly into a renderer-specific
 resource, bypassing the application-level
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span> 
 object and all
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiImageConverter.htm">NiImageConverter</a></span>-based 
 texture conversion at load time entirely.</p>

<p>Textures that are internal to a NIF may be shared, even
 across NIF files, but only if the same texture palette is used to load all
 those NIF files (either by using the same
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span>
 or by transferring the
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturePalette.htm">NiTexturePalette</a></span>
 from one
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span>
 to another).  This sharing is best managed
 by the application which knows when streams may or may not share an
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturePalette.htm">NiTexturePalette</a></span>
 to minimize the complexity of thread-safety issues.</p>

<p>[Note that each time a platform SDK (for example, Xbox360 XDK, 
 Playstation3 SDK, or Revolution SDK) changes, there is at least a possibility 
 that the new SDK will cause textures to be formatted differently on that 
 platform. It is not likely to happen frequently, but the possibility exists. 
 In such a case, it may be desirable to re-export Nifs containing platform-specific 
 textures using exporters built with that platform's most recent SDK version.]</p>

<h2>Creating NiSourceTexture Objects from NiPixelData 
 Objects</h2>

<p>Applications that load image data from their own internal 
 formats or need to create procedural textures on the fly can create <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTextures</span> 
 directly from <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPixelData</span>. 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPixelData 
 </span>objects that are used to create <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTextures</span> may 
 require power of two pixel dimensions in some cases (see below).</p>

<p>Once an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture</span> 
 is created from an application's <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPixelData</span> 
 object, the texture keeps a reference to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPixelData</span>. It does 
 not copy this data and hold the copy. As a result, applications must take 
 care before modifying the data in an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPixelData</span> 
 object that has been passed to an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture::Create</span> 
 function.</p>

<h2>Format Preferences and NiSourceTexture Creation</h2>

<p>Both of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture::Create</span> 
 functions take an optional
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexture__FormatPrefs.htm">
 NiTexture::FormatPrefs</a></span> 
 argument, which allows the application to request particular properties 
 of the texture format used in the renderers' internal cache versions. 
 These format preferences include the overall color accuracy, the alpha-channel 
 behavior (none, on/off, smooth) and the need for mipmapping. These formats 
 are only requests&mdash;renderers may choose to ignore them if they cannot 
 satisfy them. See the sections below on the image converters for details 
 of this process.</p>

<h2>Preloading of NiSourceTexture Objects</h2>

<p>When an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture</span> 
 object is created or loaded from disk, it is generally preloaded in all 
 of the currently active renderers. If the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture</span> is created 
 from a filename, the image file is read into a temporary block in memory. 
 Then, either the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPixelData</span> 
 object used to create the texture or the temporary just mentioned is converted 
 (if need be) to a format that the renderer can load to its internal cache. 
 Note that the renderers do not generally load the textures to their internal 
 video memory caches at this time&mdash;they simply format them so that the 
 transfer to the cache is as fast as possible and generate as low an overhead 
 as possible.</p>

<p>If desired, preloading of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture</span>s may 
 be disabled using the static function <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture::SetUsePreloading(false)</span>. 
 If preloading is disabled, or if a renderer was created after an <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture</span> 
 was created, then the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture</span> 
 will be loaded to the renderer's cache format when it is first required 
 for rendering in a frame. This can lead to framerate "hits" 
 when the disk is accessed during gameplay.</p>

<h2>Textures with Non-power-of-two Dimensions</h2>

<p>A full-screen splash screen is an example of a texture 
 with non-power-of-two dimensions. Often, it is desirable to use such a 
 texture "as is", without wasting texture storage due to power-of-two 
 dimension requirements, or having to stretch a texture with power-of-two 
 dimensions to screen dimensions.</p>

<p>Gamebryo supports non-power-of-two texture dimensions 
 on hardware that supports them. For example, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPixelData</span> 
 objects that are used to create <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTextures</span> 
 may have non-power-of-two pixel dimensions if the hardware supports it, 
 but require power-of-two pixel dimensions otherwise. Refer to the specific 
 renderer documentation for information regarding support for non-power-of-two 
 textures.</p>
