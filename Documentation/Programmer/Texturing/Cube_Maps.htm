<h1>Cube Maps</h1>

<h2>Introduction to Cube Maps</h2>

<p>Cube maps are form of texture map that maps 3D unit vectors into colors.
They avoid many of the problems that occur with sphere
maps&mdash;discontinuities, inability to render to them, etc. However, they are
only supported on some platforms and hardware and are by no means
universal.</p>

<p>The basic concept of a cube map is a unit cube with six sides, centered at
the origin. Each face of the cube can be thought of as a 2x2 unit square, lying
in each of the following planes: X=1, X=1, Y=1, Y=1, Z=1, Z=1. Each cube face
is a square texture that represents a 90-degree field-of-view image shot from
the origin, facing out in the given direction. Put together, these six images
form a one-to-one mapping of directions to texels. The figure below shows how
the cube faces may be visualized:</p>

<div class="NDLFigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/image030.gif" width="528" height="248"> 
    <!-- <p class="NDLFigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
</div>

<p>Because each of the faces is square, flat and represents a 90-degree field
of view, it is very easy to render to these textures in such a way that the
cube map can represent an entire scene as viewed from a given point at a given
time. Because they can be rendered on the fly, Cube Maps can create incredibly
realistic reflections, including live rendered reflections of dynamic objects
in the scene.</p>

<p>Although Cube Maps are commonly used as environment maps, this is not a
fixed limitation. Any projected texture may be a cube map, including projected
lights. By creating a cube map that represents all of the static lighting in a
scene, applications can apply a cube map as a projected light and generate
complex lighting situations with lights coming from all directions with a
single map.</p>

<p>To use Cube Mapping, applications must make two changes to an existing
projected effect: The effect texture must be an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderedCubeMap.htm">NiRenderedCubeMap</a></span> or
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiSourceCubeMap.htm">NiSourceCubeMap</a></span>, and
the texture coordinate generation mode must be either <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">DIFFUSE_CUBE_MAP</span> or <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SPECULAR_CUBE_MAP</span>. The sections below describe how to
create and use Cube Maps. For an example of how to use Cube Maps, see the
Gamebryo <span class="NDLSystemFont">CubeMap</span> sample.</p>

<h2>Using Rendered Cube Maps</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedCubeMap</span> objects are the most
commonly used cube-mapping textures, as most applications use Cube Maps to
represent live rendered reflections. By re-rendering the faces of the cube maps
frequently (sometimes as often as re-rendering all six cube faces each frame),
the reflection will always represent the scene as it actually appears,
including dynamic objects.</p>

<p>Creating an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedCubeMap</span> is very
simple, as there are few options: the cube map size, the renderer, and optional
format preferences. The size must be a power of two, and is used as the width
and height (in texels) of each cube face. The renderer must be the renderer
that is to be used for all operation involving the cube map; updates,
texturing, etc). The format preferences allow the application to request
destination alpha and/or color depth. Note that currently, an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedCubeMap</span> is never mipmapped. When creating any
cube map, keep in mind that the size of the cube map will be proportional to
the size of six normal textures of the same dimensions.</p>

<p>With a rendered cube map, the application generally must select a center for
the cube map, at which the camera used to render the cube map will be centered.
Often, this center is the center of the reflective object to which the Cube Map
is to be applied. Having selected the center of the Cube Map's coordinate
system, the application must then iterate over as many cube faces as desired,
aiming the camera for that cube face and rendering the scene into the cube
face. Here are the camera settings required for rendering a cube face:</p>

<p>The following settings are the same for all cube faces:</p>

<ul>
    <li>View Frustum Left = 1.0f</li>

    <li>View Frustum Right = 1.0f</li>

    <li>View Frustum Top = 1.0f</li>

    <li>View Frustum Bottom = 1.0f</li>

    <li>View Frustum Near = Application-dependent</li>

    <li>View Frustum Far = Application-dependent</li>
</ul>

<p>Renderer Left-Right Swap: <span class="NDLSystemFont">TRUE</span></p>

<p>The following settings are different for each cube face (the view direction
is the first column of the camera rotation matrix, and the up direction is the
second column. The third column is the cross product of the first and second
columns):</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedCubeMap::FACE_POS_X</span>

        <ul>
            <li>World View Direction: <span class="NDLSystemFont">&lt;1, 0,
            0&gt;</span></li>

            <li>World Up Direction: <span class="NDLSystemFont">&lt;0, 1,
            0&gt;</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedCubeMap::FACE_NEG_X</span>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">World View Direction: &lt;-1, 0,
            0&gt;</span></li>

            <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">World Up Direction: &lt;0, 1,
            0&gt;</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedCubeMap::FACE_POS_Y</span>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">World View Direction: &lt;0, 1,
            0&gt;</span></li>

            <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">World Up Direction: &lt;0, 0,
            -1&gt;</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedCubeMap::FACE_NEG_Y</span>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">World View Direction: &lt;0,
            -1,0&gt;</span></li>

            <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">World Up Direction: &lt;0, 0,
            1&gt;</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedCubeMap::FACE_POS_Z</span>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">World View Direction: &lt;0, 0,
            1&gt;</span></li>

            <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">World Up Direction: &lt;0, 1,
            0&gt;</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedCubeMap::FACE_NEG_Z</span>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">World View Direction: &lt;0, 0,
            -1&gt;</span></li>

            <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">World Up Direction: &lt;0, 1,
            0&gt;</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To create the render target groups for a rendered cube map, the preferred
method is to use the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderTargetGroup__CubeMapSetupHelper.htm">NiRenderTargetGroup::CubeMapSetupHelper</a>
class:</p>
<pre>
// Generate an NiRenderTargetGroup for each face
NiRenderTargetGroup::CubeMapSetupHelper kCubeMapHelper(m_spCubeMap);
</pre>

<p>In order to update a rendered cube map, the most common method is as
follows:</p>
<pre>
m_spRenderer-&gt;SetLeftRightSwap(true);
FOR Each cube face "eFace" to be updated
    m_spCubeMap-&gt;SetCurrentCubeFace(eFace);
    m_spRenderer-&gt;BeginUsingRenderTargetGroup(
        kCubeMapHelper.m_aspRenderTargetGroups[(unsigned int)eFace],
        NiRenderer::CLEAR_ALL);
    Set camera settings as given above for the current cube face
    Render the scene
    m_spRenderer-&gt;EndUsingRenderTargetGroup();
END FOR 
</pre>

<p>Note that NiRenderer::BeginUsingRenderTargetGroup must be called on the
<a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderTargetGroup.htm">NiRenderTargetGroup</a> object
that corresponds to the desired face.</p>

<p>For an example of how to use and update NiRenderedCubeMap objects, see the
<a href="../../Learn/Demos/Overview_!CubeMap.htm">CubeMap</a> sample.</p>

<h2>Using Source Cube Maps</h2>

<p>Although less common in practice, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiSourceCubeMap.htm">NiSourceCubeMap</a></span> maps.
Source cube map objects are very much like <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiSourceTexture.htm">NiSourceTexture</a></span>
objects, but have six files, or <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span> objects, or
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData.htm">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</a></span>
objects associated with them, one for each face. They also have the notion of a
"current" face, which is the face for which data can be retrieved or changed
on-the-fly at a given time. See the reference documentation for <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiSourceCubeMap.htm">NiSourceCubeMap</a></span></p>

<p>Creation of an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiSourceCubeMap.htm">NiSourceCubeMap</a></span>
requires six image filenames, or six <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span> objects, or six
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData.htm">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</a></span>
objects. These objects may not be mixed&mdash;a source cube map must be created
from six objects of the same type. The other requirements are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>All six input images (pixel data or filenames) must be square</li>

    <li>All six input images must be the same size</li>

    <li>All six input images must be the same incoming format</li>

    <li>The size of each image must be a power of two</li>
</ul>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceCubeMap</span> object requires a
renderer with which it will be associated. If the given renderer cannot support
cube mapping, the creation function will return NULL.</p>

<p>In terms of artwork for source cube maps, the artist must generate six image
files that represent the cube map, one file for each face. Creation of these
cube maps can be tricky, as the matching edges of the six images must match
pixel-for-pixel, or else seams will be apparent in the cube map. Perhaps the
best way for an artist to visualize the cube is as the unfolded cross-shape in
the figure above. In fact, the artist can create the cube map as a single image
in an image creation program, and simply cut the image into the six faces
before exporting. An example of such a cube map is shown below.</p>

<h2>Using Cube Maps as Projected Multitextures</h2>

<p>A cube map may be used as the texture image for any projected multitexture
(<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span>). However, if a cube map is
used for a projected multitexture, that <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span> must use one of the two cube-mapping
texture coordinate generation modes (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">DIFFUSE_CUBE_MAP</span> or <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SPECULAR_CUBE_MAP</span>), as a cube map always expects 3D
texture coordinates. The most common uses of cube maps are as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Specular environment maps (similar to the sphere maps above):

        <ul>
            <li>Use a dark base texture on the object receiving the map (as the
            cube map will be added to the base)</li>

            <li>Set the cube map as the texture for an environment map
            (generally uses a rendered cube map for live effects)</li>

            <li>Use the SPECULAR_CUBE_MAP coordinate generation mode</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Diffuse omni-directional light maps

        <ul>
            <li>Use a bright (fully-lit) base texture (as the cube map will
            darken the base map)</li>

            <li>Set the cube map as the texture for an environment map
            (generally uses a source cube map with the lighting painted into
            it)</li>

            <li>Use the DIFFUSE_CUBE_MAP coordinate generation mode</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
