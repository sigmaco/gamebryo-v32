<h1>Texture Coordinate Wrapping and Clamping</h1>

<p>The first step in texturing a polygon at a given pixel 
 is to determine the point to be sampled from the texture. This point is 
 determined by interpolating and mapping the per-vertex texture coordinates. 
 Texture wrapping or clamping are the two mapping modes used to map an 
 unbounded floating-point texture coordinate to one that falls into the 
 range of the texture (0&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;U,&nbsp;V&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1). The 
 figure below shows the two cases, along with the original texture.</p>

<p>Texture U and V values between 0 and 1 are always handled 
 in the same way&mdash;they map directly to a point on the texture map that 
 is the given proportion from one end of the texture to the other. However, 
 the method used to map texture coordinates that are greater than <span class="NDLSystemFont">1.0</span> or less than <span class="NDLSystemFont">0.0</span> can be selected by the application. There are currently two options for  this in Gamebryo, and both are equally useful in different situations.</p>

<p>Texture coordinate wrapping causes texture coordinates 
 to be used as if the texture tiled infinitely in both directions. As a 
 result, this mode is used in scenes where a base texture is repeated over 
 and over across a surface. For example, a long hallway in a game level 
 might use texture wrapping to repeat a stone brick texture along the length 
 of the hall. However, it is very important in most cases that when texture 
 wrapping is used, that the texture have toroidal topology. That is, the 
 left and right edges must be equal, and the top and bottom edges must 
 be equal. If a wrapped texture does not have this property, then there 
 will be jarring and obvious edges between each copy of the texture, and 
 the surface will have a "gridded" appearance.</p>

<p>Texture coordinate clamping causes texture coordinates 
 that are out of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">[0.0,1.0]</span> 
 range to be clamped to the closest value that is in range. As a result, 
 if texture coordinates that are out of range are specified, then the texture 
 will appear as a single copy of the texture, surrounded by the top, left, 
 bottom and right edges extending out the rest of the way. For example, 
 if the texture is a bullet hole surrounded by a black (translucent) border, 
 then using texture clamping can allow the bullet hole texture to be applied 
 to an entire polygon. Only one copy of the bullet hole will appear; the 
 rest of the polygon will be textured with the translucent edge of the 
 texture. This is extremely useful when used with the dynamic projected 
 textures and decal polygons described below.</p>

</div>

<p>Note that clamping and wrapping may be set independently 
 for the U and V axes of a texture. To use texture clamping, applications 
 wishing to set texture wrapping or clamping on a given <span class="NDLSystemFont">Map</span> should use <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTexturingProperty::Map::SetClampMode</span>. 
 The argument to this function describes the mode used to address the texture. The possible options are as follows:</p>

<table>
	<thead>
  	<tr>
			<th>Wrapping Mode</th>
			<th>Behavior</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
    	<td>WRAP_S_WRAP_T</td>
			<td>Both texture dimensions are wrapped infinitely.
			
			<div class="NDLTDNote"><span class="NDLTableNote">Note:</span> This is the default clamping mode.</div>
			</td>
		</tr>
    <tr>
			<td>WRAP_S_CLAMP_T</td>
			<td>U dimension is wrapped and V dimension is clamped to be between 0 and 1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>CLAMP_S_WRAP_T</td>
			<td>U dimension is clamped to be between 0 and 1 and V dimension is wrapped</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>CLAMP_S_CLAMP_T</td>
			<td>Both dimensions are clamped to be between 0 and 1</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
