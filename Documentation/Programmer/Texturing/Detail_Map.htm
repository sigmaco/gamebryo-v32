<h1>Detail Map</h1>

<p>Detail Maps are RGB maps that define high-frequency 
 detail to be overlaid on a base texture. An example of the need for detail 
 maps is often seen in applications when the player walks up very close 
 to a wall while facing it. With just a base texture, most applications 
 cannot afford infinite detail in the map (since that would require huge 
 textures), so the filtering produces a blurred, soft image. This is jarring 
 to players who had been drawn into believing in the otherwise detailed 
 game world. Detail Maps can alleviate this by using an important observation: 
 when the camera is close enough to a surface that it looks blurry, they 
 can only see a small part of the Base Map at a time.</p>

<p>Detail maps can help resolve this problem as they are 
 generally applied at a much higher wrapping frequency than the Base Map 
 (often 16x to 64x), the Detail Map only becomes visible when the camera 
 moves close enough that the base texture would be blurry. However, by 
 the time the camera is that close, the Detail Map is at a level such that 
 the pixel-to-texel ratio is almost one, avoiding any blurriness. In some 
 ways, it is similar to the effect of a Dark Map, using two small textures 
 to create the appearance of one very large texture. In fact, these techniques 
 can be used together to create textures that appear to be enormous. For 
 example, a 64x64 Detail Map repeated 32 times over a Base Map that is 
 itself repeated 16 times over a Dark Map gives an overall texturing effect 
 that appears to be 64 times 32 times 16&mdash;effectively, what appears to 
 be a 32,768 x 32,768 pixel texture.</p>

<p>Detail Maps are applied using a multiply 2X mode. The 
 color of the Base Map and the color of the Detail Map are multiplied together. 
 The result is multiplied by two. Assuming a texture range of [0, 1], the 
 Detail Map may darken <em>or</em> brighten the Base Map. If the Detail Map 
 is ½ brightness, the brightness of the Base Map will be unchanged. If 
 the Detail Map is fully white, the color of the Base Map will be doubled. 
 </p>

<p>The best way to ensure that the effect will look as 
 similar as possible with and without Detail Map support is to create a 
 Detail Map whose colors are centered about ½ brightness. In this way, 
 when the object is viewed at a distance, it will appear the same with 
 or without the Detail Map due to mipmapping and filtering causing an averaging 
 of the values. A common way to create such a texture is to create a noise 
 texture with a range from 0 to ¼ brightness, and then add a constant 3/8 
 brightness to each texel. The resulting texture will have a mean of ½ 
 and amplitude of ¼.</p>
