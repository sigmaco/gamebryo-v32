<h1>Image Converters</h1>

<p>Gamebryo ships with two distinct image converters: the base class
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiImageConverter.htm">NiImageConverter</a></span> and
the development time <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDevImageConverter.htm">NiDevImageConverter</a></span>. The purposes of these two converters are distinct.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiImageConverter</span> is only able to load
textures that have been stored in NIF format. It also does not include code for
mipmap generation. This converter is intended for runtime release code usage on
fixed-format platforms. Specifically, the hope is that console-based
applications will use the development image converter only during their
development process and will eventually save out preformatted texture data. In
this case, at application release time, only the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiImageConverter</span> would be required to read the
preformatted NIF data. Unlike the development image converter the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiImageConverter</span> does not require code for loading any
format other than NIF and can thereby reduce application size. Note that
because <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiImageConverter</span> is designed for
non-development systems, it will fail any task it cannot handle. Specifically,
because it cannot load BMP (or other traditional format) images, it would fail
a request to create a texture from BMP data. However, because some platforms
such as Win32 D3D do not have a fixed set of texture formats that are always
supported, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiImageConverter</span> is not
suitable for these platforms.</p>

<p>Conversely, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDevImageConverter</span> is
able to load many traditional image formats including TGA, BMP and SGI, as well
as NIF. It also contains code for doing automatic mipmap generation.
Additionally, it includes code for doing platform specific texture conversion
to many Gamebryo supported platforms. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDevImageConverter</span> is intended to be used by
non-console platforms or console platforms during the application development
process for console apps&mdash;not with shipping console products.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiImageConverter</span> can easily be derived
from to allow applications to support custom texture formats.</p>

<h2>Platform-Specific Image Saving</h2>

<p>As mentioned, images can be saved to platform specific formats. To
facilitate this, the texturing system supports an optional "platform specific
subdirectory" during texture saving and loading. This directory is accessed
with the static <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiImageConverter</span> member
functions <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetPlatformSpecificSubdirectory</span>
and <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetPlatformSpecificSubdirectory</span>. When
set, the image loaders of the image converter system will first look in
"base-directory/platform-specific-directory" for an image filename. If a
texture is not found in the platform specific subdirectory, the traditional
search paths are used. As an example, Xbox 360 specific images might be saved
by first calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetPlatformSpecificSubdirectory</span> with a value of
"Xbox360".</p>

<p>The platform specific directory can also be used in both the Gamebryo 3ds
max Plug-in and the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in. At export time, the artist is given
the option of choosing platform-specific export. They must then specify a
subdirectory to use for saving the textures. In the case of Xbox 360, the
default is "Xbox360". At run-time, an application using the NIF files exported
in this manner would then need to call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetPlatformSpecificSubdirectory</span> prior to loading the
data using an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> object. This would
cause the image loaders to look in the appropriate subdirectory when searching
for images during the loading process. Note that the platform specific
subdirectory is not saved into the main NIF file. This allows the same base NIF
file containing geometry to use textures saved for different platforms. This
would be accomplished simply by exporting the data multiple times, once for
each platform that is needed, and then calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetPlatformSpecificSubdirectory</span> appropriately.</p>

<p>Platform specific images can also be saved internally to NIF files, although
this is not recommended. The disadvantages of internally saved images remain
the same as previous versions of Gamebryo (i.e. inability to share texture data
across multiple NIF files) with one additional issue: by saving platform
specific images internally, the base NIF itself (the one containing geometry,
animations, etc.) thereby becomes platform specific. This can be an obvious
problem in a cross-platform situation.</p>

<h2>Mipmap Pre-Filtering</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDevImageConverter</span> can be used to
generate mipmap pyramids automatically for many incoming texture formats. The
function to do this is <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDevImageConverter::GenerateMipmapLevels</span>. The Gamebryo
3ds max Plug-in and the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in use this function to export
textures with complete mipmap pyramids as they are needed by the content. In
other words, it an artist sets up an object to use trilinear (pyramidal in 3ds
max) texture filtering, the texture, if saved to either external or internal
NIF format, will contain a full mipmap pyramid.</p>

<p>Automatic pyramid generation is not possible from palettized image formats.
Instead, the path for using palettized mipmap pyramids is to use external files
and the <span class="NDLSystemFont">GenerateMipmapPyramidFromFiles</span>
function. This function also gives an application the flexibility to explicitly
set an entire mipmap pyramid from custom generated images whether or not they
are palettized. In the case of generating a pyramid of palettized images, we
recommend Equilibrium's Debabelizer Pro 4.5 for generating the source files due
to its support for sharing a palette among a sequence of images.</p>

<p>Note the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiImageConverter</span> base class
cannot generate mipmap pyramids.</p>
