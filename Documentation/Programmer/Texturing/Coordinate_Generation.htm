<h1>Coordinate Generation</h1>

<p>Perhaps the most important settings in a projected multitexturing effect are
the settings that define the generation and processing of the texture
coordinates that will be applied to each affected object in the scene. These
settings define how the textures will be projected out into the scene.</p>

<p>The texture coordinate generation settings are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">WORLD_PARALLEL:</span> The world-space
    object vertices are supplied as the inputs to an affine transformation
    (parallel projection) whose result is a set of 2D texture coordinates.
    These are useful for generating infinite-parallel spotlight projections,
    such as the light from a tightly focused searchlight or from the sun.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">WORLD_PERSPECTIVE:</span> The world-space
    object vertices are supplied as the inputs to a projective transformation
    (perspective projection) whose result is a set of 3D homogeneous texture
    coordinates&mdash;i.e. a set of 2D perspective projected texture
    coordinates. These are useful for generating cone-like spotlight
    projections.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">SPHERE_MAP:</span> The world-space-object
    normal vectors or reflection vectors are transformed into a sphere-mapped
    texture coordinates. The exact mapping is described below in the section on
    Environment Maps, which is the most common case of their use.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">DIFFUSE_CUBE_MAP:</span> The
    world-space-object normal vectors are supplied as inputs to an affine
    transformation whose result is a set of 3D texture coordinates. These
    texture coordinates are only useful with Cube Maps, which require 3D
    vectors that represent the direction to be looked up in the Cube Map.
    Because the results are based on the normal vectors, the results tend to
    appear more diffuse than specular. Most often, this mode is used with a
    projected light Cube Map that represents the diffuse lighting in a scene.
    For details of Cube Mapping, see the section below on Cube Maps.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">SPECULAR_CUBE_MAP:</span> The
    world-space-object reflection vectors are supplied as inputs to an affine
    transformation whose result is a set of 3D texture coordinates. These
    texture coordinates are only useful with Cube Maps, which require 3D
    vectors that represent the direction to be looked up in the Cube Map.
    Because the results are based on the reflection vectors, the results tend
    to appear more specular than diffuse. Most often, this mode is used with an
    environment map Cube Map that represents the specular lighting in a scene.
    For details of Cube Mapping, see the section on <a href=
    "Cube_Maps.htm">Cube Maps</a>.</li>
