<h1>Projection Texture Matrix Creation</h1>

<p>An important concept that one must understand with respect
to <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm">NiTextureEffect</a></span>-based
projections is how the texture projection matrices are defined in an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span>
object. As we would expect, the texture coordinate transform takes as its input
the world-space object vertices for each object and produces texture
coordinates as its output. The interface for setting the texture coordinate
transform in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span>
sets the transform matrix and translation in "model-space", however. The
question a first-time user may ask is "which model-space"? It would seem that
there are two choices&mdash;either the model space of each object whose texture
coordinates are being calculated, or the model space of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span>
itself.</p>

<p>The answer is the latter&mdash;the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span> itself, with
very good reason. By specifying the transform in the model-space of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span>
object, the overall effect will move with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span> object. As a
result, a texturing effect may be attached to objects in the scene as a child,
or the transforms of the effect object may be changed and both will result in
sensible changes to the effect. For example, an application can set up a
texture coordinate projection matrix and transform that cause a headlight image
to be projected down the model-space X-axis of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span> object,
centered at its origin. Having done this, the application may then attach this
object to a car model in the scene. As the car model moves, the headlight
effect will move with it without the application ever having to change the
projection matrix in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span> object again. In this way, an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span>
is similar to an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span>.</p>

<p>Gamebryo takes care of the matrix manipulations that are
required to ensure that each object's vertices are transformed according to the
matrix specified in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span> object, even though the model
space of each projected object will probably differ from one another and from
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span>
object itself.</p>
