<h1>Introduction to Multitextures</h1>

<p>Gamebryo supports the ability to render objects whose 
 polygons have multiple textures applied simultaneously. This feature can 
 allow for some incredible effects. The interfaces of Gamebryo support 
 a basically unlimited number of textures per object. However, note that 
 Gamebryo renderers may have definite limits on the number and kind of 
 textures that may be applied to an object. For details, see the renderer 
 manual for the particular renderer you intend to use.</p>

<p>Gamebryo supports two basic forms of multitexturing 
 via its default pipeline: static and projected. An easy way to understand 
 the difference between the two is by a simple physical analogy. Static 
 multitextures represent surface properties of the objects to which they 
 are attached, while projected multitextures represent spatial phenomena 
 such as the reflected environment or a shaft of light coming from a window 
 in the scene. These forms differ in the way that the effects are specified, 
 as well as the general types of effects that are supported. The two forms 
 of multitexture may be used together or independently. The following sections 
 introduce the two forms of multitexture and describe the differences.</p>

<p>At a high level, multitexturing is the use of more than 
 one texture simultaneously on the same set of polygons. By combining the 
 multiple textures in different ways, subtle or striking effects can be 
 created. These effects will be described below and include (but are not 
 limited to) pseudo-lighting effects, slide and movie projector effects, 
 specular highlights, reflective and glossy surfaces, shadows, and overlaid 
 details.</p>

<p>The basic technical distinction between the two classes 
 is equally simple. Static multitextures are attached as a <span class="NDLSystemFont">Map</span> to an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTexturingProperty</span>, and are mapped using texture coordinates defined in the geometric objects to which the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTexturingProperty</span> is attached. </p>

<p>On the other hand, projected multitextures are applied 
 to a set of objects via the same scoping mechanism used by dynamic vertex 
 lights and are mapped to the geometry via dynamically-generated texture 
 coordinates that are computed inside the low-level renderer.</p>

<p>Gamebryo supports several different types of multitextured 
 effects within each of the two categories. They are summarized in the 
 tables below, and each will be detailed later in this document:</p>
