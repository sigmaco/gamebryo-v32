<p>The image that an artist generates for a Bump Map is 
 either an RGB or RGBA image, where the color channels are a grayscale 
 "height map"&mdash;brighter in high areas and darker in low areas. 
 If the artist generates an RGBA image, the alpha channel will represent 
 a monochrome gloss map. If the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture</span> 
 for the Bump Map is created in code, then the application must set the 
 texture preferences pixel layout value to <span class="NDLSystemFont">BUMPMAP</span>&mdash;if this is not set, the image will not be converted from the height 
 map format to the gradient-based bump map format required by low-level 
 renderers, and the bump map will not work. If the map is specified as 
 a bump map in a supported modeling tool (such as 3ds max or Maya), then 
 the exporter will ensure that the correct texture preferences are set 
 for the map.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Filter: Dependent upon 
 the effect&mdash;there are no specific requirements for Bump Maps. However, 
 mipmap modes are helpful to avoid "shimmering" effects in the 
 rendered images.</li>
	
	<li>Clamping: Dependent 
 upon the effect.</li>
	
	<li>Texture Coordinates: 
 Completely dependent upon the desired effect&mdash;bump map effects are as 
 varied as base texturing. However the coordinates tend to either cause 
 the texture to be mapped once across the surface (representing large-scale 
 rolling bumps across the surface), or repeated numerous times across the 
 surface (representing a small-scale texture or bumpiness of the surface). 
 Of the two, small-scale bumpiness is by far the most common.</li>
	
	<li>Other Settings: The 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTexturingProperty::BumpMap</span> 
 object that must be used for bump mapping includes six other settings 
 not shared with other types of static maps. These values are as follows:
	
  	<ul>
  		
  		<li>The Bump Matrix: 
   A 2x2 matrix that is defined by the four bump map matrix entries (<span 
   class="NDLSystemFont">SetBumpMat00</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetBumpMat01</span>, 
   <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetBumpMat10</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetBumpMat11</span>) 
   defines the rotation and scale of the bump map's <span class="NDLSystemFont">dU</span> 
   and <span class="NDLSystemFont">dV</span> channels w.r.t. the environment 
   map coordinates. The incoming bump map <span class="NDLSystemFont">dU</span> 
   and <span class="NDLSystemFont">dV</span> as sampled from the bump are multiplied 
   as a vector times the 2x2 matrix, and then applied to the U and V values 
   computed for the environment map. Most frequently, the 00 and 11 matrices 
   are set to the same positive value between 0 and 1.0, depending on the 
   roughness of the surface. The 01 and 10 elements are left at 0.0 in these 
   cases. Other values may be used to rotate the basis of the bump mapping.</li>
  		
  		<li>The Bump Luma Scale 
   and Offset: Because Bump-mapping cannot be used with a gloss map, most 
   bump-mapping hardware supports adjusting the luminance of the environment 
   map (also known as the glossiness). This is normally stored in the luminance 
   channel of the bump map. The luminance scale and offset values may be 
   used to modify these values on the fly. The Scale value is multiplied 
   by the incoming Luma value from the bump map (or times 1.0 if the Bump 
   Map has no Luma information), and then is added to the Offset value. Generally, 
   the Scale is set to 1.0 and the Offset to 0.0.</li>
  	</ul>

</ul>
