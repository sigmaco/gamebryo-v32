<h1>Creating NiRenderedTexture Objects</h1>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderedTexture.htm">NiRenderedTexture</a></span>
objects are much simpler to create than <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiSourceTexture.htm">NiSourceTexture</a></span>
objects, as there are fewer options. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedTexture</span> objects simply represent an offscreen
framebuffer for a renderer. As a result, to create an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedTexture</span> object, the application simply calls
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedTexture::Create</span> with the renderer
that will render and use the texture, the height and width of the texture, and
optional preferences that describe the desired format of the texture.</p>

<p>Note that there are occasions where a renderer will not be able to create an
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedTexture</span> for some reason, such as
such not being able to match the requested texture dimensions or pixel format,
running out of texture memory, or some other reason. As a result, applications
must be prepared to handle the failure of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Create</span> call. See the desired renderer manual for details
of whether rendered textures are always supported, conditionally supported, or
never supported, and what conditions can cause the creation to fail.</p>

<p>Unlike <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture</span>s, "preloading" has
no meaning in this context, as creating a rendered texture from a renderer
always attempts to create the texture in device memory immediately. Note that
rendered textures generally reserve enough video memory to hold their image
data when they are created and do not release this video memory until they are
destroyed.They generally cannot be managed, as can <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedTexture</span>s.</p>

<p>Currently, mipmapping is not supported with <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedTexture</span>s in Gamebryo.</p>
