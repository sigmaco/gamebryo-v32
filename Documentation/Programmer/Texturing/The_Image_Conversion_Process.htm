<h1>The Image Conversion Process</h1>

<p>The image conversion process can include any of the 
 following steps depending on the incoming texture data and the application's 
 preferences.</p>

<h2>Expansion of Compressed Textures</h2>

<p>If the incoming format is a compressed formats and the 
 destination format is not a compressed format (if the incoming and destination 
 formats are different compressed formats, the conversion will fail), then 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiDevImageConverter.htm">NiDevImageConverter</a></span> 
 class will expand the data into the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPixelFormat::RGBA32</span> 
 format before continuing. If the incoming and destination formats are 
 equal compressed formats, then this step will pass the incoming data along.</p>

<h2>Mipmap Pyramid Generation</h2>

<p>As mentioned previously, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDevImageConverter</span> 
 class can be used to automatically generate mipmap pyramids. If the pyramid 
 was not generated at export time, the development converter can do this 
 when the texture is first loaded. However, it is recommended that textures 
 be saved with mipmap pyramids to avoid the overhead of runtime pyramid 
 generation. Note that the mipmap pyramid generation code in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDevImageConverter</span> class 
 can only filter standard formats such as <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPixelFormat::RGB24</span>, 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">RGBA32</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">PAL8</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">PALA8</span>. Since incoming unprocessed 
 bump maps come in as <span class="NDLSystemFont">RGB24</span> 
 or <span class="NDLSystemFont">RGBA32</span>, mipmap pyramids 
 can be generated for these as well (this is useful to avoid aliasing in 
 the bump maps).</p>

<h2>Bump Map Conversion</h2>

<p>If the incoming format is RGB24 or RGBA32 and the destination 
 format is a Bump map, then the converter must convert the RGB(A) "height 
 map" to a gradient-based bump map. It does this by determining the 
 "slope" of the incoming height map, treating the red channel 
 of the map as a height field&mdash;the brighter the red component at a pixel, 
 the higher the bump. As a result, any constant color represents a flat 
 surface. Only differences in surface slope matter. The alpha channel, 
 if supplied, is copied directly into the luminance channel of the destination 
 (if it exists), and will serve as the glossiness of the surface. For an 
 example of a bump map and the resulting behavior, see the section on <a 
 href="Using_Bump_Maps.htm">bump 
 maps and static multitexturing</a>.</p>

<h2>Format Conversion</h2>

<p>The format conversion for a specific platform, whether 
 it is done at export time or at runtime via the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDevImageConverter</span>, 
 is accomplished by comparing an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiSourceTexture.htm">NiSourceTexture</a></span> 
 object's requested format preferences with the incoming pixel data and 
 the capabilities of the renderer. The format preferences are passed to 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceTexture::Create</span> 
 function. They are defined in the
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexture__FormatPrefs.htm">
 NiTexture::FormatPrefs</a></span> 
 class and consist of one flag each for pixel layout, alpha channel, and 
 mipmapping. The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexture.htm">NiTexture</a></span> 
 documentation gives details on the meaning of the flag values.</p>

<p>The matching process of determining an appropriate destination 
 pixel format for the conversion process is unique to each renderer. In 
 all cases though, the renderers do a best fit match using the following 
 guidelines: pixel layout requests are of higher precedence than alpha 
 format requests and mipmapping must occur prior to conversion to a renderer 
 specific format that makes mipmap pyramid generation impossible. Basically 
 this means that requesting alpha from an incoming texture format that 
 does not include an alpha channel will not cause an alpha channel to be 
 magically created. It also means that incoming data must be in a standard 
 format (or be able to be converted to a standard format) if a mipmap pyramid 
 is to be generated.</p>
