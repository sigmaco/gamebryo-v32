<h1>Environment Map</h1>

<p>Environment Maps are RGB maps that are added to the 
 Base Map to simulate mirror-like reflection of the environment surrounding 
 the mapped object. Often used with a Gloss Map or Bump Map, this effect 
 can be very striking, giving a very realistic impression of a mirrored 
 object.</p>

<p>Although any form of texture coordinate mapping may 
 be used with Environment Maps, almost all Environment Maps use sphere 
 mapping as their texture coordinate generation method. This is because 
 the texels in an Environment Map generally represent the color seen in 
 a given direction in camera or world space, not at a given position. As 
 a result, Environment Maps should be mapped using a method that maps direction 
 vectors, rather than positions into the map. In Gamebryo, this is the 
 sphere mapping method.</p>

<p>Note that by default, sphere mapping maps from world 
 space&mdash;as a result, the Environment Map is assumed to be fixed to the 
 world, so there is no need to have multiple environment sphere maps for 
 different camera angles. As the camera moves around the Environment Mapped 
 object, the reflection changes correctly, without any intervention from 
 the application.</p>

<p>Most hardware can also support a form of environment 
 mapping called Cube Mapping. Much more flexible and powerful than sphere 
 mapping, Cube Maps allow applications to create live-rendered environment 
 maps, allowing the reflections to appear very realistic. However, some 
 old hardware doesn't support Cube Maps. See the renderer manuals for details 
 on the support for Cube Maps, and the projected multitexture sections below 
 for a discussion of how to create and use Cube Maps on supported platforms.</p>

<p>Since Environment Maps are added to the Base Map, applications 
 must be careful not to use extremely bright images for their Environment 
 Maps, except in the few texels that represent directions of specular highlights.</p>

<p>An object may have only one Environment Map applied 
 at a time. If more than one Environment Map is applied to the same object, 
 any one of the Environment Maps may be used. Applications should not depend 
 upon any particular behavior in this case, and should avoid it whenever 
 possible.</p>
