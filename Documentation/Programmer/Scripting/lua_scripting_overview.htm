<h1>Lua Scripting Overview</h1>

<p>As a Lua scripter who is working with Gamebryo LightSpeed, you will be creating
<em>behaviors</em> running on <em>entities</em> that call <em>built-in API methods</em> to interact
with the Game Framework.</p>

<h2>Behaviors</h2>

<p>A Lua behavior is simply a function with a specific signature and naming convention. The
<a href="../../Tools/EntityModelingTool/emt_intro.htm">Entity Modeling Tool</a> is used to define
the behaviors that exist on models. The model name determines the script file name and the function
name must match the given behavior name.</p>

<p>The following sections contain more information about behaviors:</p>

    between scripted behaviors</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Entities</h2>

<p>An entity is a data-driven collection of properties and behaviors. Behaviors always run in the
context of a specific entity, but they can also interact with other entities. You can read and
write entity properties to implement game logic.</p>

<p>The following sections contain more information about entities:</p>

    properties</a></li>

    practices for working with entity properties</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Built-in API</h2>

<p>Built-in methods are C++ functions that are wrapped so that they can be called from Lua. The
built-in API is the set of all available built-in methods that you can call from behaviors. These
methods are divided into multiple built-in API libraries.</p>

<p>There are several built-in API libraries that come standard with LightSpeed. Different
applications with different needs should use only those modules that correspond to the system
services used by the application. In addition, many applications will want to add their own built-in
API libraries.</p>

<h2>Debugging behaviors</h2>

<p>After you familiarize yourself with the basics of behaviors, entities, and built-in methods, the
next challenge is to debug your scripts. LightSpeed enables you to rapidly iterate on script
changes. This enables you to write scripts, debug and refine them, and push your updates to an
already running program. In addition, a Lua script debugger is included. This debugger allows you
to place break-points and step through your scripts line by line.</p>

    your behavior scripts using the Script Debugger</a></li>

    behaviors</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Special Lua Considerations</h2>

<p>There are a few special considerations to keep in mind when coding Lua scripts:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can call <span class="NDLSystemFont">require</span> to load additional Lua modules
    including most of the standard modules. This will load the requested module synchronously. 
	It is recommended that these modules be moved into your
    asset web so that they can be asynchronously loaded using SchedulerLua::PreloadModule instead.</li>

    <li>Most behaviors are executed using Lua coroutines. Some older Lua libraries may not be
    compatible with coroutine usage so we recommend being careful as to what modules are used.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">table.foreach()</span> Lua method is deprecated in Lua 5.1
    and should not be used. This method is not compatible with coroutines and can result in a crash
    if used. Instead use the <span class="NDLSystemFont">pairs</span> or <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ipairs</span> method with a <span class="NDLSystemFont">for</span> loop.</li>

    <li>Performing expensive operations such as blocking file I/O from Lua is not recommended.</li>

    <li>For complex and/or performance critical operations, consider calling a custom C++ built-in
    API from your script rather than implementing the entire operation in script. Even entire
    behaviors can be converted into C++ behaviors for performance once the implementation has been
    finalized.</li>
</ul>
