<h1>Loading Lua Scripts at Runtime</h1>

<p>There are several ways you can load Lua scripts at runtime.
Traditional approaches include setting the Lua runtime
package.path global variable and converting Lua scripts into
bytecode using luac and converting this bytecode into a C byte
array using bin2c.</p>

<p>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1 introduced two additional ways to load
Lua scripts for use at runtime: Lua script preloading and
automatic loading with flat model, entities, and world files.
Both preloading and automatic loading use a background thread to
load Lua scripts from disk. Automatic loading also calculates
script dependencies and loads dependent scripts as needed.</p>

<p>Each of these loading techniques has advantages and
disadvantages. This section describes each of these
approaches.</p>

<h2>Traditional Approaches to Loading Lua Scripts</h2>

<a name="package_path" id="package_path"></a><h3>Setting Lua package.path</h3>

<p>The approach most familiar with Lua developers is to add the
paths to all Lua scripts to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">package.path</span> Lua runtime global variable,
either using the LUA_PATH environment variable or setting it
directly in script or C++ code. Setting <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">package.path</span> informs Lua where to search
at runtime for files and modules when executing '<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">require</span>' and '<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">dofile</span>' functions. Lua performs a search
of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">package.path</span> for these
files if they are not already loaded. If a matching file is
found, Lua loads the file into the runtime.</p>

<p>Setting the <span class="NDLSystemFont">package.path</span> is
an easy way to load modules at runtime. Most of the work is done
by the Lua runtime as it loads necessary modules or files.</p>

<p>There are several issues related to using this approach. Lua
will perform File I/O whenever a file isn't already loaded. The
runtime will search every path in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">package.path</span> until it finds what it needs
or it exhausts all paths. It can be hard to predict when this
search and load will happen. All file I/O in Lua happens in the
foreground thread using synchronous I/O calls. This can lead to a
temporary drop in frame rate as the main thread performs these
synchronous operations.</p>

<p>We recommend that you avoid this approach when using the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">efd::AssetFactoryManager</span>.
Instead, use script preloading and automatic script loading to
load all of your scripts at runtime. This ensures that the
scripts that are loaded at runtime exist in your Asset Web. It
also enables both rapid iteration on Lua scripts and runtime Lua
debugging in Toolbench.</p>

<a name="embedded" id="embedded"></a><h3>Embedding Lua Bytecode</h3>

<p>The next approach uses the luac compiler and a tool like bin2c
to convert Lua source scripts to an embedded byte array
representation. Converting scripts into a byte array means there
is no disk I/O at all at runtime. Your scripts live as part of
your runtime application and will always be available.</p>

<p>This can be an excellent approach to deploying your scripts in
a shipping configuration. Your scripts are no longer available on
disk, you have strict control over when they're added and removed
from the runtime, and you avoid all disk I/O to load your
scripts.</p>

<p>Some issues related to this approach include increased
application memory footprint, more build steps required to do the
conversion, and a disconnect between the source Lua files and the
byte arrays. Converting all of your scripts into byte arrays
implies these arrays are always available at runtime. This will
increase the static memory footprint of your application, which
may not be acceptable in some applications. There is also
additional overhead involved in converting the scripts to
bytecode and then converting the bytecode into a C byte array.
This step is best resolved by updating your build procedures to
do this automatically. If do not automate this step, you run the
risk of having your Lua source scripts and the byte array used at
runtime becoming out of synch.</p>

<p>This approach also precludes the ability to rapidly iterate on
your Lua script files, and may prevent you from debugging Lua
scripts at runtime.</p>

<p>We recommend that if you plan to embed your scripts into your
application, reserve this step for shipping configurations only.
This approach enables you to rapidly iterate and debug your
scripts during development and embed the finished product only in
shipping builds.</p>

<h2>Lua Script Loading in Gamebryo LightSpeed</h2>

<p>Gamebryo LightSpeed includes two additional ways to load your
scripts: preloading and automatic loading. You can use these
approaches together to make your scripts available to the Lua
runtime system.</p>

<a name="Preloading" id="Preloading"></a><h3>Lua Script Preloading</h3>

<p>By using script preloading, you can take advantage of the
background loading capabilities built into the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">efd::AssetFactoryManager</span>. This enables you
to load your scripts into the Lua runtime system without
synchronous I/O in your main application thread. The preloading
system will calculate dependencies for you and load them when
necessary. This means that you do not have to track Lua script
file dependencies by hand.</p>

<p>To use Lua script preloading, you need to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Include an efd::AssetFactoryManager instance.

        <p class="indent1">The efd::AssetFactoryManager enables
        background loading of assets. Please note, including this
        service implies most assets are background loaded
        asynchronously. This behavior is not limited to Lua
        scripts.</p>
        <pre>
    AssetFactoryManagerPtr spAFM = EE_NEW efd::AssetFactoryManager();
    m_spServiceManager-&gt;RegisterSystemService(AssetFactoryManager::CLASS_ID, spAFM);
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Get an instance of the egfLua::SchedulerLua object.

        <p class="indent1">We need the egfLua::SchedulerLua
        object to make our preload requests.</p>
        <pre>
    Scheduler* pSim = m_pServiceManager-&gt;GetSystemServiceAs&lt;Scheduler&gt;();
    ISchedulerScripting* pLua = pSim-&gt;GetScriptingRuntime(BehaviorType_Lua);
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Call egf::ISchedulerScripting::PreloadModule function for
    each module you want to load.

        <p class="indent1">The
        egf::ISchedulerScript::PreloadModule function takes two
        arguments: the name of the module (without file
        extension), and an optional callback category. This
        category, if present, is used to forward the
        egf::ScriptFactoryResponse messages to the requestor once
        the script load is processed. You can use this callback
        to check the status of the load request and perform any
        error handling in case the script load failed.</p>
        <pre>
    pLua-&gt;PreloadModule("MyModule", myCallbackCategory);
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Optionally register a handler to listen for Asset load
    completion messages.

        <p class="indent1">If you provided a callback category
        when calling PreloadModule, you need to register a
        handler function to receive the response.</p>
        <pre>
// We need both of these. If the asset fails to locate, we'll get a generic AssetLoadResponse
EE_HANDLER(MyClassRequestingPreload, HandleAssetLoadResponse, efd::AssetLoadResponse);
// If the asset is located, we'll get a ScriptFactoryResponse.
EE_HANDLER_SUBCLASS(MyClassRequestingPreload, HandleAssetLoadResponse, 
    efd::AssetLoadResponse, egf::ScriptFactoryResponse);
</pre>

        <p class="indent1">And implement this handler in your
        class.</p>
        <pre>
void MyClassRequestingPreload::HandleAssetLoadResponse(
    const efd::AssetLoadResponse* pMsg, 
    efd::Category targetCategory)
{
    if (pMsg-&gt;GetResult() != AssetLoadResponse::ALR_Success)
    {
        // Error handling here...
    }

    const ScriptFactoryResponse* pResponse = EE_DYNAMIC_CAST(ScriptFactoryResponse, pMsg);
    
    // Do something with the response. e.g. track it against a list of requests.
}
</pre>
    </li>
</ul>

<a name="Automatic" id="Automatic"></a><h3>Automatic Lua Script Loading</h3>

<p>If you are using the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">efd::AssetFactoryManager</span> to load flat
models, entities, or world files in the background, all behavior
scripts that are associated with these objects will automatically
be loaded along with the requested asset. This automatic script
loading includes any dependent scripts needed to execute these
behaviors. If all of your Lua scripts are implementations of
Model behaviors and you're using the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">efd::AssetFactoryManager</span> to background
load assets, you do not have to do anything to load your Lua
scripts. The runtime entity system will load the necessary Lua
scripts in the background automatically.</p>

<p>You can combine automatic Lua script loading with preloading
to load all of your Lua scripts in a background thread. Automatic
Lua script loading is used to load your behaviors. Lua script
preloading is used to load any non-behavior related Lua scripts
that are needed by your application.</p>
