<h1>Best practices for working with behaviors</h1>

<p>The simulated game world is object oriented. We recommended following the principle of
    separating interface from implementation. An interface can be created by defining a set of
    abstract Behaviors which can be thought of as pure virtual methods in C++. You must set the
    abstract trait for the Behavior in the interface Model. Any Entity that derives from such an
    interface Model is declaring it is able to perform the given behavioral actions. The
    implementations can then be separated under child (elemental) models to give a more specific
    behavior. Following this approach disentangles the various implementations of a behavior from
    one another making it easier to mix them together creatively. It provides a much richer approach
    than creating a strict hierarchy or taxonomy of entities. It also frees the designer to think
    about game concepts without having to consider how the implementation code should be structured.
    </p>

<h2>Process-oriented vs. Event-oriented</h2>

<p>There are two ways to implement Behaviors&mdash;as process-oriented or event-oriented logic.</p>

<ul>
    <li>We recommend using the process paradigm in which your behavior will sequentially run
    through a set of instructions that consume game time. For example: walk over to the door, open
    it, hit the enemy, and so on. A process-oriented behavior replaces the use of state machines. A
    linear sequence of many actions can be implemented in a single Behavior. A branching sequence
    of events can be handled with branching logic in the Behavior code. Of course, as the code gets
    larger and more complex, it should be split into multiple functions using good coding
    standards. The process-oriented approach allows an implementer to more quickly see the flow of
    control as compared to a state machine.</li>

    <li>Another useful approach which could be considered a combination of the other two is to
    spawn a new Behavior when entering a new game state and exiting the current Behavior. In this
    case, the Behaviors would be named after the state or activity the entity is performing. For
    example: doPatrol (which would loop through all patrol points), doPursue (which would set a
    target and repeatedly adjust trajectory). Each of these states can still consume time, but is
    shorter lived that implementing the entire logic of the entity in a single branching
    Behavior.</li>

    <li>The event paradigm consists entirely of immediate behaviors which complete in a single
    tick. All C++ behaviors must use the one tick event paradigm, since coroutines or threads would
    consume too many resources. Event oriented immediate Behaviors are somewhat faster, but cannot
    make the entity sleep or wait. Instead, the implementation would schedule a "wakeup" event to
    continue execution of the entity after a period of waiting. In this case, the Behaviors would
    be named after a single action in the decomposed sequence. For example: moveTowardGoal,
    beginPursuit, selectNewPatrolPoint.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Coding Behaviors</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>Naming Conventions</b>: The name of the behavior should be descriptive of the action
    being requested and performed. There are two common types of behaviors: active (imperative)
    ones which are invoked by the entity itself or by a behavior running on another entity. These
    active behaviors should start with the verb "Do" like: DoOpen. The other is passive where the
    behaviors get run as a reaction to something like creation or destruction of an entity. For
    example OnCreate and OnCollide. AI-related Behaviors should be named after the action being
    requested to occur, not just the name of the active AI state occurring when the Behavior is
    executing. For example, use DoPatrol, or DoAttack, instead of IsAttacking (which would be a
    much better name for a Property).</li>

    <li><b>Behavior Parameters</b>: Parameters passed to behaviors can be optionally named. It is
    highly recommended that all parameteres passed to an 'Extends' or 'Reverse Extends' behavior be
    named and accessed by their name. This allows multiple behavior implementations to be mixed
    together and each continue to work independently. In general named parameters should be used
    anyway to allow overrides to extend the parameter list without worrying about the parameter
    ordering. This also protects against changes to the parameter order and makes it easy to search
    for all behaviors that use a given parameter.</li>

    <li><b>Call Behaviors</b>: In addition to using Behaviors as events, is common and recommended
    to call other behaviors from a behavior much like a nested procedure call. This makes the code
    reusable and easier to read. One benefit of this approach is that these calls can occur across
    language boundaries. A more efficient alternative that sacrifices some of the object oriented
    abilities of a regular Behavior is to encapsulate the called code in a regular function. For
    example a non-behavior Lua function in the Lua file for a model.</li>

    <li><b>Call Built-ins</b>: Built-ins are implemented in C++ and are used to expose system
    capabilities to a Behavior. They are clearly the most efficient way to implement logic, but do
    not support rapid iteration. They are most commonly referred to in groups as a Behavior API,
    and can be thought of as a library or as an importable script "module".</li>

    <li><b>Importing Modules</b>: This allows access to built-ins, behaviors or helper functions
    from other modules.</li>

    <li><b>Coding Standards</b>: Code in a behavior should comply with a studio coding standard to
    facilitate readability. Script is code and can be significantly complex and deserves
    documentation, useful variable names, and so on.</li>

    <li><b>Main Loop</b>: Although it can be done, no behavior should loop forever even if it is
    sleeping and switching between different Entities. It is more efficient to let entities become
    idle and have no outstanding behaviors between high level independent actions like an combat
    engagement. However, there are situations where very long running behaviors can be convenient
    like a continuous connected sequence of actions.</li>

    <li><b>Storing Values</b>: It is crucial to differentiate between local variables and entity
    properties. Local variables will be scoped to the behavior only. If another behavior is going
    to use that variable, the user needs to store the value in a property. On the other hand if the
    value is going to be used once by another behavior, the value can be passed along as a
    parameter to a Behavior by storing it into the ParameterList.</li>

    <li><b>Not Used as Accessors</b>: Behaviors should not be used as getters and setters. Use the
    get and set Property API instead. Behaviors should be viewed as actions (where a set of
    commands occur) rather than a regular method.</li>

    <li><b>AI Actions:</b> It is common for games to use a naming convention to publish which
    behaviors are available for the AI system to invoke. Some will compute the string name of the
    behavior to be invoked, or use the string to query other entities for whether they provide a
    desired capability. We recommend implementing these sorts of systems using abstract models
    (interfaces). For example, if you want an AI to manipulate doors, you might want a doOpen
    behavior. We suggest this be declared in an "Openable" model. That allows Openable to be
    extended (perhaps with doLock, doUnlock), and it is trivial to mix the capability into other
    objects like cupboards, safes, or cars.</li>

    <li><b>Polymorphic Behavior:</b> We recommend using model inheritance to implement
    polymorphism. By judicious mixing, various behavior implementations can be selected while
    leaving the interface to an entity the same. This approach should replace two common and less
    desirable approaches. One is to embed the string name of a desired behavior into a string
    Property, then use that string to invoke a configuration-time selected behavior. The second is
    to write code to inspect the model type of a target entity to determine what actions to
    perform. Instead, in both these cases, a behavior can be declared and associated with one or
    the other entity that provides the same functionality. Since it is declared in the structure of
    the Model and not in data or script code, it is easier to understand and follow the logic. The
    benefit of doing this is that by changing the mix-in hierarchy, new behavior will emerge
    without changing any code, or editing Property values.</li>

    <li><b>Plugin Behaviors:</b> You can define a behavior on an entity that is supposed to run on
    a different kind of entity (for example, the player character). This technique allows the
    addition of new entity types and ways to interact with it but without updating every entity it
    is supposed to interact with. For example a designer could add a chair to their game in an
    expansion pack or late in development that provides the ability for the player to sit. The
    sitting logic, say in doSit, timing, animations and tuning values would be associated with the
    chair entity. The game would be coded to run doSit on the player character entity using
    properties stored on the chair. You would directly invoke an immediate behavior on the chair
    using CallBehavior which will run on the caller. The call would need to pass the caller's
    entityID since doSit would want to affect the player character, and "self" would be the chair
    in this case. A good policy would be to extract the player's EntityID from the stream and
    consistently store it in a variable called otherID.</li>
