<h1>How behaviors work</h1>

<p>Behaviors can be thought of as events or Entity actions. An Event will kick off a series of
    Behaviors, each calling another, possibly on other Entities, blocking and returning until the
    original Event finishes. At that point, there is no more context for that Event and it can be
    considered finished. For example, a mine Entity may trigger a countdown, detonate, cause nearby
    Entities to take damage, then reset. Any asynchronous Events spawned in that computation are now
    running in their own Event context that will eventually wind up and complete. For example, the
    damage in the mine example may cause a sequence of knock-back, and get-up, or death. When all
    Events for an Entity have completed, the Entity is idle. There may be delayed Events queued for it
    that the system will eventually deliver, thus creating a new Event context at that time. We
    recommend designing Entities to return to idle with no outstanding Behaviors as that is a much
    more resource friendly approach than a "ticking" idle.</p>

<p>Events can effectively spawn nested sub-Events by using a blocking SendEvent. Those sub-Events
    become part of the computation needed to complete the top-most Event. However, from the
    sub-Event's perspective, it seems like a top-most Event, and can also spawn its own sub-Events.
    When all the blocking sub-events complete, the caller can continue to compute.</p>

<p>The behavior system does not support an explicit "receive" call for messages or Events. Instead
    the Entities go idle, and the system delivers new events and asynchronously pushes them onto the
    Entity. This can be thought of as an event handler or callback.</p>

<p>When an Event is ready to be run, the system will find an idle co-routine (micro-thread) on the
    target Entity, and in that context begin to run the associated Behavior. Once that Behavior
    completes, the co-routine becomes idle and is recycled, and the next available Event on the
    Entity's queue can be executed. If there are more queued events than co-routine "slots"
    (currently limited to four per Entity), Events will be artificially delayed.</p>

<p>Entities do not have an infinite "main loop" to do their work. If an Entity needs to perform
    actions an a regular basis, the OnTick behavior should be used to schedule the entity to run
    periodically.</p>
