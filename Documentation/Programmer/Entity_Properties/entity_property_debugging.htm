<h1>Debugging entity properties</h1>

<p>This section provides some hints on how to debug problems related to entity properties.</p>

<h2>Attempt to access a property that is not scalar.</h2>
<p>If you attempt to access a List or Map property without using an index, you'll receive an error
message reporting an attempt to access a property that is not scalar. To fix this, use the correct 
property accessor methods for List or Map properties.</p>

<h2>Property is not found.</h2>
<p>If you receive a log message indicating a property was not found, the following hints may help
you identify the underlying problem.</p>

<p>The property may not be mixed into the entity's model. Check your entity model to make sure the 
property was mixed in as expected.</p>

<p>The property may have traits set that limit your ability to interact with the property.
Check the property traits to make sure your process can access the property. If the 'ServerOnly'
trait is set on the property it is not visible from client processes.</p>

<p>Check the value of your arguments to the property accessor methods. If you're using property names
when calling accessors, make sure the name matches what is found in the entity model. If you're using 
cached property IDs make sure your cached value is current.</p>

<h2>Property doesn't update.</h2>
<p>If you attempt to update a property at runtime and the property value doesn't appear to change,
the following hints may help.</p>

<p>If the property has the 'ReadOnly' trait set, the property cannot be changed at runtime. Check
your property and remove the 'ReadOnly' trait if you need to update the property at runtime.</p>

<p>If you're attempting to update a property on a reflected entity, make sure the 'Mutable' trait
is set. If the property belongs to a reflected entity and the 'Mutable' trait is not set, only the
owning simulator can update the property directly.</p>
