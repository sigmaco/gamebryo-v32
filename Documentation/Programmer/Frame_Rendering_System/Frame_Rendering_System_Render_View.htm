<h1>Frame Rendering System Render View</h1>

<p>A <em>render view</em> 
 represents a view into a particular scene that must be rendered. At its 
 base level, it generates and returns an array of potentially visible geometry 
 objects to the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiViewRenderClick.htm">NiViewRenderClick</a></span> 
 class so that those objects can be rendered. The method by which it generates 
 that array is implementation-specific, but a typical method is to cull 
 a scene graph against the viewing frustum of a camera.</p>

<p>The same render view can be used by multiple render 
 clicks, if desired. Each render view caches its last generated array of 
 potentially visible geometry and the ID of the frame at which that array 
 was generated to avoid recomputing the array for a different render click 
 in the same frame.</p>

<h2>NiRenderView</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderView.htm">NiRenderView</a></span> 
 class is an abstract base class for all render view objects. It contains 
 pure virtual functions for setting the camera data on the renderer with 
 a specified viewport and for generating an array of potentially visible 
 geometry objects. It also holds cached values for the last generated array 
 and the last frame ID to avoid building the array again during the same 
 frame.</p>

<p>Typically, an application would create one or more render 
 view instances during initialization and assign them to <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiViewRenderClick.htm">NiViewRenderClick</a></span> 
 objects. Those render views are then automatically used during the rendering 
 process, requiring no further application intervention unless some value 
 on the render view must be programmatically changed. Since <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderView</span> 
 is an abstract class, applications create instances of one of its derived 
 classes.</p>

<p>The current frame ID is passed into the <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetPVGeometry</span> 
 function by the render click. This ID is used to eliminate the computation 
 of the geometry array when called during the same frame. An enumerated 
 value can be passed into that function to force computation of the array, 
 if necessary. When the array needs to be computed, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetPVGeometry</span> 
 function calls the pure virtual <span class="NDLSystemFont">CalculatePVGeometry</span> 
 function to regenerate the array.</p>

<h2>Ni3DRenderView</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/Ni3DRenderView.htm">Ni3DRenderView</a></span> 
 class is the most standard render view used in the frame rendering system. 
 It holds pointers to a list of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a></span> 
 scene graphs, an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiCamera.htm">NiCamera</a></span>, 
 and an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiCullingProcess.htm">NiCullingProcess</a></span>. 
 It overrides the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CalculatePVGeometry</span> 
 function to frustum cull the scene graphs using its culling process and 
 build the array of potentially visible geometry. If no culling process 
 has been set for the render view, it will add all geometry objects to 
 the array without culling.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">Ni3DRenderView</span> also 
 overrides the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetCameraData</span> function 
 from its parent class to use the stored camera to set the camera data 
 on the renderer. It optionally supports always using the viewport stored 
 on its camera rather than the viewport passed into the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetCameraData</span> 
 function by the render click. This class provides interfaces for getting 
 and setting the list of scenes, the camera, and the culling process so 
 that applications can have some measure of control over them at runtime.</p>

<p>Applications create <span class="NDLSystemFont">Ni3DRenderView</span> 
 instances during initialization and specify the scenes, cameras, and culling 
 processes for them. These render views are then assigned to the appropriate 
 render click objects to be used during rendering. In most cases, an application 
 will have no need to change its <span class="NDLSystemFont">Ni3DRenderView</span> 
 data during rendering. If a different scene needs to be rendered, a different 
 render view should be used.</p>

<h2>Other Types of Render Views</h2>

<p>While <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/Ni3DRenderView.htm">Ni3DRenderView</a></span> 
 is the most common, it is not the only render view implemented in the 
 frame rendering system. Any collection of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderObject.htm">NiRenderObject</a></span> 
 objects that need to be rendered can be encapsulated in a render view. 
 Here are some examples of other render views that ship with Gamebryo:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh2DRenderView.htm">NiMesh2DRenderView</a></span>: 
 stores a list of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> 
 objects.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiScreenFillingRenderView.htm">NiScreenFillingRenderView</a></span>: 
 stores a single, screen-filling quad (useful for performing full-screen 
 post-processing effects).</li>
 
</ul>
