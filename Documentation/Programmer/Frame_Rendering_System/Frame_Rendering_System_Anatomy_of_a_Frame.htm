<h1>Frame Rendering System Anatomy of a Frame</h1>

<p>The frame rendering system allows you to set up complex 
 rendering effects in advance and then automatically perform those effects 
 each frame. It does this with a series of objects that can be activated 
 and deactivated or re-configured each frame and that provide hooks for 
 an application to easily customize their behavior. It is also possible 
 to extend many of these objects to perform completely custom operations 
 but still have them work within the confines of the system. This helps 
 enable more portable code, as frame rendering system objects from one 
 application can be easily dropped into another application that uses the 
 frame rendering system.</p>

<p>This section describes, at a high level, what each object 
 in the frame rendering system does and how they relate to each other. 
 For a more detailed description of the various frame rendering system 
 components, see the <a href="Frame_Rendering_System_Components.htm">System 
 Components</a> section.</p>

<h2>Render Frame</h2>

<p>The top-level object in the system is the <a href="Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Frame.htm">render 
 frame</a>. A render frame represents an entire rendering process. Multiple 
 render frames may be held by an application, but only one is required. 
 An application sets up the render frame at initialization time and then 
 tells it to draw and display itself each frame in its idle processing 
 loop.</p>

<p>The render frame doesn't perform any rendering itself. 
 Instead, it holds a collection of render steps. Each frame, it iterates 
 through the render steps, telling each one to render. You can hook pre- 
 and post-processing callback functions to a render frame that are invoked 
 before and after it renders and can be used to abort the rendering process.</p>

<h2>Render Step</h2>

<p>A <a href="Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Step.htm">render 
 step</a> is a single rendering effect. Multiple steps are strung together 
 to render the entire frame. Render steps do the actual rendering work 
 in the system. They can do this with a single pass or with multiple passes.</p>

<p>Render steps store an active state that the render frame 
 observes when telling them to render. Thus, entire render steps can be 
 easily turned off by application code. They also provide pre- and post-processing 
 callbacks that can be used to perform custom configuration each frame 
 or even to abort execution of the render step.</p>

<p>Render steps can optionally provide access to the render 
 target group that will contain the final result of their rendering operations. 
 This feature can be used to swap out the render target groups used for 
 various rendering effects, which can be handy when ping-ponging render 
 buffers during full-screen post processing, for example.</p>

<p>Completely custom render steps can be created by an 
 application, but the most common type of render step performs one or more 
 rendering passes via render click objects.</p>

<h2>Render Click</h2>

<p>A <a href="Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Click.htm">render 
 click</a> is a single rendering pass. It encapsulates any number of rendering 
 operations that all occur to the same render target group. Multiple clicks 
 can be combined together in a render step to produce a complete rendering 
 effect. Each render click is associated with a single render target group, 
 to which it renders its output.</p>

<p>Render clicks can be easily enabled or disabled each 
 frame in several ways. First, each render click contains an active state 
 that can be changed by applications to easily disable rendering of that 
 click. Alternatively, a <a href="Frame_Rendering_System_Render_Click_Validator.htm">render 
 click validator</a> object can be associated with the render click that 
 uses some criteria to determine whether or not the render click should 
 be executed for a particular frame. Finally, pre- and post-processing 
 callbacks are available that can be used to perform additional operations 
 or customize behavior each frame. The callbacks can also be used to abort 
 rendering on any particular render click.</p>

<p>Several stock render click objects ship with the frame 
 rendering system that know how to render particular types of Gamebryo 
 objects. For <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span>-based 
 objects, however, there is another method that can be used. A particular 
 type of render click will render an array of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> 
 objects that are provided to it by one or more render view objects. A 
 <a href="Frame_Rendering_System_Render_List_Processor.htm">render 
 list processor</a> can be attached to such a render click, which is given 
 a chance to process and potentially render the array of geometry objects 
 both before and after the render click tries to render that array. This 
 allows geometry objects to be sorted prior to rendering or even to have 
 their materials or properties easily swapped out for rendering and then 
 replaced.</p>

<h2>Render View</h2>

<p><a href="Frame_Rendering_System_Render_View.htm">Render 
 view</a> objects provide a certain type of render click with an array 
 of geometry to render. They can do this by culling a scene graph against 
 a camera or by using some other algorithm to determine which geometry 
 objects need to be rendered. Each render view caches an array of this 
 geometry so that it can be shared between render clicks but only have 
 to compute the array a single time for any given frame.</p>

<p>Several stock render view objects ship with the frame 
 rendering system that deal with different types of Gamebryo objects. The 
 most common of these culls an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a></span> 
 scene graph against a particular camera's frustum using a particular culling 
 process. Other render views exist to generate an array of screen elements 
 or even a single, screen-filling quad useful for full-screen post-processing 
 effects.</p>
