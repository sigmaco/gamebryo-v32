<h1>Understanding Replication Groups and Categories</h1>

<p>Replication groups let you organize an entity's properties into multiple arbitrary sets. The
replication group defines the unit of data that can be updated to a specific set of consumers. The
group by itself, however, does not control which specific set of consumers should receive the
update. This is controlled by the category value used by each specific entity for that group. A
group might consist, for example, of all the properties needed by observing entities in the same
room and a specific category would specify <em>which</em> room the entity is in. Every instance of
some particular entity type can choose to use different category values even though they are
sharing the same group definition. In this way the replication groups define <em>what</em> data
should be sent and the category determines <em>who</em> the data should be sent to.</p>

<p>The result is that the assignment of categories to specific replication groups on specific
entities and the subscription to those same categories by interested observers is how you manage
the area of interest for a multiplayer game. The overall policy for how you decide what category
values should be used for each replication group is called the categorization policy. For small
prototypes or simple games with only a few players the categorization policy could be as simple as
using a single replication group with a single well-known category value. Larger or more complex
games will want to pay significant attention to devising a categorization policy that minimizes
bandwidth while ensuring smooth game play. For most games replication producing entities will
typically change the category value to which they publish updates as they move around the game
world or as other property state changes. The category value might be algorithmically computed
based on various entity property values. Other replication groups may be turned on or off based on
game state by switching between a valid category and the invalid category value (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">kCAT_INVALID</span>).</p>

<p>Regardless of the specific categorization policy that will work best for your application there
are many common elements to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Replication categories are set at runtime either through behavior scripts or C++ APIs. At
    tool-time you define the replication groups, but the specific category values to be used
    typically dynamically respond to your game state and therefore must be set at run-time. Only in
    the most basic of cases would it make sense to statically assign fixed categories so the tools
    do not even support this rare case.</li>

    <li>The unit of replication is the replication group, not the entire entity. This provides more
    fine-grained control over what data is sent to other clients and allows a single entity to use
    multiple area of interest mechanisms at the same time. For example, an observer might be
    interested in all nearby entities and also any entities in the same adventuring party. This
    observer could consume both the category for the "local area" replication group and also the
    category for the "my party" replication group. The actual category values are most likely
    computed using properties on the observing entity, such as their current location and which
    party they are in.</li>

    <li>Producer entities can only publish updates to a single category per group, but observers
    can choose to consume as many groups as they wish. Producer entities should not need to know
    anything about who, if anyone, is consuming their updates, they simply generate updates based
    on their own entity state. It is the observer who must decide how large of an area can be
    observed. For example, if the world was divided into geometric grids each with its own category
    then a producer simply publishes into the current grid category but an observer might be able
    to "see" across many grid areas and would subscribe to all the visible categories.</li>

    <li>Each entity can have up to 32 replication groups and each of these groups can use a
    different category. This allows different sets of information to be published to different
    interested consumers. Also remember that the same entity property can be in multiple groups.
    See <a href="sso_replication_config_groups.htm">Configuring Replication Groups</a> for details
    about assigning properties to groups.</li>

    <li>Updates normally contain only those properties that have changed since the last update.
    Still, if a category has many producers or the replication group has many frequently changing
    properties this can result in a lot of bandwidth. Consider also using replication policies in
    such cases to further reduce bandwidth. See <a href=
    "sso_replication_policies.htm">Understanding Replication Policies</a> for details.</li>

    categories for each replication group on a specific entity, see <a href=
