<h1>Best Practices for working with Replication</h1>

<p>You should plan the entire replication approach needed for your game. You should start by
establishing how your game will use Replication. Think about how and when entities in your game
need to communicate changes in their state and how you want to organize that communication.</p>

<p>There are three aspects to optimizing Replication, these are the assignment of properties to
replication groups, the replication group policies, and the categorization policy. These three
aspects can be generalized as what data to send, how to send it, and who to send it to.</p>

<a name="ThinkingAboutReplicationGroups" id="ThinkingAboutReplicationGroups"></a><h2>Thinking about Replication Groups</h2>

<p>Replication Groups express patterns or styles of information exchange and not specific sets of
observers. For example, a group might be used to publish updates to "any observer in the same room"
but you would not want to use a group for each specific room. Your game might have thousands of
rooms, each of which is simply a unique category value used with the single "current room"
replication group. In other words, the replication groups control what data will be replicated and
using multiple groups allows different subsets of data to be sent to different consumers.
Replication groups do not control who receives the data.</p>

<p>There are 32 replication groups available and every property for every model can be placed into
zero or more of these groups. This might seem overwhelming but by using good group assignments it
should become obvious what model properties belong in what replication groups. The replication
settings will also inherit from mixed in models so it typically only requires a handful of changes
to configure the replication groups for your game. Many online games may only need to use one or
two replication groups. Don't use additional groups if they are not needed, simply using more
groups alone does not imply better performance. Use the minimum number of groups that allow you to
send the minimum amount of data to just the consumers that need it.</p>

<p>What replication groups will you need? Consider the following items:</p>

<ul>
    <li>When are different sets of properties needed: if certain data is only needed under certain
    conditions then consider placing that data into a group used only when that condition is in
    effect. For example, you might display very detailed information about the selected entity;
    rather than adding that information into a group that is widely needed such as "current room"
    you should place it into a separate group that is only consumed when the selection occurs such
    as "examination data".</li>

    <li>What subsets of Properties are used by only certain other Entities: for example an AI might
    exchange data with other nearby AIs of the same type. Create a separate group for this exchange
    rather than bundling the rarely needed data into another group that goes to a wider set of
    consumers.</li>

    <li>What subsets of Properties are needed by clients: use separate groups of information that
    is observed by clients and information only used by the host or server.</li>

    <li>How often must data be updated: if different consumers have different update frequency
    requirements consider making multiple replication groups that each use a different replication
    policy even if these groups contain exactly the same properties. For example, radar-tracking
    missile might need more frequent position updates about the target than would otherwise be
    sent, rather than updating the rate at which all position updates are sent consider making a
    separate group for requesting high frequency updates.</li>

    <li>Toolbench suggests default names for some of the replication groups and hides the
    additional unnamed groups. You should consider renaming these groups to match your specific
    needs rather than trying to force your game into the suggested patterns. See <a href=
    "#ChoosingReplicationGroupNames">Choosing Replication Group Names</a> below for details.</li>
</ul>

<a name="PlanningReplicationGroupPolicies" id="PlanningReplicationGroupPolicies"></a><h2>Planning Your Replication Group Policies</h2>

<p>Each of the 32 replication groups can have a replication group policy attached. You should
customize these policies to meet your specific needs. The default policy is to send update messages
every frame that a property changes but this default almost always results in sending many small
messages, so it is recommended that a rate limit be applied to every group even if a fairly high
frequency is used.</p>

<p>Consider the following questions when setting replication group policies:</p>

<ul>
    <li>With what frequency do entities need to update other clients about their changes?

        <ul>
            <li>The use of predictive contracts can greatly reduce the frequency at which property
            updates are sent through the network while providing smooth updates on other clients.
            For example, a rocket traveling in a straight line at constant speed might update it's
            position on every frame but because other clients can predict how the rocket moves you
            can avoid sending constant position updates.</li>

            <li>Try to design your game to be tolerant of small timing delays. Relying on absolute
            synchronization between all clients will not perform well over the Internet.</li>

            <li>Think about the rate of change of the properties. A frequently changing property
            that updates at a high rate will consume a lot of bandwidth, consider sending updates
            less frequently to compensate.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Are there some groups of entities that need to update more or less frequently?

        <ul>
            <li>If you are using a geometric decomposition you may wish to update entities close to
            an observer at a faster rate than you update entities that are far away from the
            observer. Consider making multiple replication groups that contain the exact same
            properties but use different policies to adjust the update frequency.</li>

            <li>Some special types of entities might want to update more frequently than normal.
            For example, a boss monster might want to update frequently even if it is far away so
            it might use a special replication group with a different policy.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Do you need to replicate sensitive or confidential information? What other quality of
    service concerns should be considered?

        <ul>
            <li>The replication group policy can change the quality of service used to send
            replication updates. If you are sending confidential information you should use an
            encrypted quality of service.</li>

            <li>Replication policies should always use a reliable quality of service but you can
            use an unordered quality of service if desired.</li>

            <li>Depending on the volume of updates you may benefit from using a compressed quality
            of service. If a group typically contains a large number of dirty properties then it
            can benefit more from compression.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<a name="ChoosingCategorizationPolicies" id="ChoosingCategorizationPolicies"></a><h2>Choosing Categorization Policies</h2>

<p>The categorization policy is where interest management is optimized. Optimizing the balance
between the number of producers into a category and the number of consumers of that category will
have the most direct impact on bandwidth consumption and game responsiveness. You must consider
both the behavior of replication producers and also the behavior of replication consumers. It is
best to publish into a category that is large enough that producer entities are not constantly
changing the category being used but is also small enough that you are not sending unnecessary data
to consumers who have no use for it. Observers will most often subscribe to multiple categories to
provide seamless visibility across boundaries. Observers should subscribe to a wide enough area so
they can both render the necessary data but also be prepared for player movement in the face of
possible network latency.</p>

<p>For most games a simple geometric categorization policy will suffice for the majority of data.
Common geometric categorization policies include room based, distance based, gridded or hybrid
approaches that combine these using multiple replication groups. When using a room based
categorization policy the producer entities simply publish updates into a category based on the
current room. Observer entities will subscribe to the category for the room they are in and will
typically also subscribe to the categories for additional nearby rooms. The category for each room
might be simply set in data or it might be computed from other properties such as position. For a
distance based categorization policy the category could be defined as "within a certain distance"
from the entity. You might use a gridding of space and compute the category as a function of
position or you might lookup a category using a spacial partitioning tree or manually constructed
volumes. Observer implementations might intersect a sphere or cone representing the area they can
see and then subscribe to each intersected category. So long as both producers and observers use
the same algorithm to compute the categories for each replication group the system will work. The
common element is that producers will publish into a single category based their location and
observers will subscribe to one or more categories based on which areas they can see.</p>

<p>For non-geometric data, computing a unique category is generally much simpler. For example, you
could replicate data to all members of the same guild by simply assigning a unique integer to each
guild and using that value to construct the category. This approach works well for variable groups
such as adventuring parties, chat channels and game lobbies. This even works well when there may be
many thousands of group instances. Another approach would be to assign names to each of these
groups and map those names to categories using the data-driven enumeration system in Foundation.
This works well in cases where there are a fixed number of valid group names.</p>

<p>For all of the policies suggested above, producing entities will want to change the category
into which they produce replication updates in response to various state changes for the entity. In
many cases you may only want to update the subscriptions at some minimum interval to avoid numerous
rapid changes. For events that occur rarely, such as joining a guild and subscribing to the "guild"
category, scripts that perform the join operation will likely want to directly change the
subscriptions. For categorization policies connected to rapidly changing data such as position it
might be best to only check the category a few times per second or to use triggers to determine
when the category needs to change. If the area covered by a single category is increased then you
can also decrease how often you need to consider changing categories.</p>

<p>At the end of the day you have the flexibility to create whatever categorization policy best
suits your game. Select an approach that meets the needs of your game.</p>

<h2>Computing Categories</h2>

<p>Many of the examples above talk about constructing categories using algorithms or looking up
integers that are used to construct categories. How exactly does this work? There are several
categorization methods that have been added to the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__MessageService.htm#">efd::MessageService</a></span> to assist with the
creation of category values that meet certain requirements. Specifically, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__MessageService.htm#classefd_1_1_message_service_1ebd209ea8d6bfb26cc0c36f9b1e9cd30">
GetServicePublicCategory</a></span> method can be very helpful for generating replication
categories. This function takes two arguments, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">serviceID</span> and
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">categoryIndex</span>:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b><span class="NDLSystemFont">serviceID</span></b>: To use the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">GetServicePublicCategory</span> method you should select a <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">serviceID</span> value that is unique to both the algorithm being used and also
    to the replication group on which the category will be set. This parameter is an <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">efd::ClassID</span> because the same method is used by system services to
    generate service-specific categories. As a result you must select a value that does not
    conflict with other system services being used. It is recommended that the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">EE_DECLARE_EXTERNAL_BASEID</span> macro defined in <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">efd/IDs.h</span> be used with a value in the range between <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">EE_EXTERNAL_BASEID_MIN</span> (0x06000000) and <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">EE_EXTERNAL_BASEID_MAX</span> (0x060fffff) to avoid the possibility of
    collision. Alternatively you may wish to construct a data-driven enumeration that assigns
    values from within this same range. This range is reserved for application use and should not
    conflict with code provided by Emergent or authorized partners. By using a properly selected
    value you ensure that the generated category will not accidentally conflict with other category
    usage.</li>

    <li><b><span class="NDLSystemFont">categoryIndex</span></b>: The <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">categoryIndex</span> parameter to this method is an arbitrary 32-bit value. The
    entire 32-bit range is available and values can be assigned through any algorithm you desire.
    Since a different <span class="NDLSystemFont">serviceID</span> value is used for every
    replication group you can use the full range of values. Also if you use different <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">serviceID</span> values for different algorithms you can avoid category
    collision errors should we convert to using a different categorization policy. The result is
    that your implementation has total freedom in computing the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">categoryIndex</span> value.</li>
</ul>

<a name="ChoosingReplicationGroupNames" id="ChoosingReplicationGroupNames"></a><h2>Choosing Replication Group Names</h2>

<p>Emergent Toolbench contains a default set of replication groups with extremely generic names.
The names for these default replication groups are simply labels and should be configured to
represent the categorization policies you have outlined for your game. Choose a name for the group
that has to do with the method of decomposition of the data and the frequency of update, not the
destinations, or consumers. It may also make sense to name the group after the classification of
properties that are assigned to it, for example "Visual" might be used with a group that contains
properties related to the visual appearance of the entity. A good name is an adjective describing
the usage pattern or kind of data in the group that will have easily understood meaning for the
designers when creating models. Also, consider the organization of your replication groups. It may
be helpful to organize your replication groups in order of frequency of use or to keep blocks of
similar categories together.</p>

<p>For a description of the default replication group names suggested by Toolbench, see <a href=
"../../Tools/EntityModelingTool/emt_fundmtls_traits.htm#ReplicationPropertyTraits">Replication
Property Traits</a>. For more on configuring replication groups, see <a href=
"sso_replication_config_groups.htm">Configuring Replication Groups</a>.</p>

<a name="TurningOffReplication" id="TurningOffReplication"></a><h2>Turning off Replication</h2>

<p>While all replication policies are universal they can also simply be turned on or off for each
entity at runtime. It is not necessary or advisable to "clear out" replication group traits from
the properties of derived models in Toolbench as future models might want to use the inherited
replication traits. Instead of clearing out all replication traits at edit time, entities that do
not need to produce replication updates should simply not specify a category at runtime. There is
no performance cost for specifying edit time replication traits unless a category is specified at
runtime.</p>
