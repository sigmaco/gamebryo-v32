<h1>Troubleshooting Replication</h1>

<p>If you are not receiving the entity discoveries or updates that you are expecting to receive,
the system log file from your application is a great resource for helping you debug the possible
causes of the problems.</p>

<p>Emergent recommends the following troubleshooting methods when you are working with
replication:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Make sure that you are creating <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/eon/eon__OnlineEntityManager.htm">eon::OnlineEntityManager</a></span> and not
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/egf/egf__EntityManager.htm">egf::EntityManager</a></span>.</li>

    <li>Ensure that logs that are related to replication and entities are enabled. These logs can
    be fairly verbose, so you might want to route them to their own log file or adjust the log
    level. The following are the modules that you need to enable to debug replication:
        <pre>
[Log.Filters]
ReplicationService = UptoErr3 | UptoLvl2
ReplicationGroups = UptoErr3 | UptoLvl2
ReplicationProducerEntity = UptoErr3 | UptoLvl2
ReplicationConsumerEntity = UptoErr3 | UptoLvl2
EntityManager = UptoErr3 | UptoLvl2
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Verify that the Replication service is available in both the producer and consumer
    processes. Look for a log line similar to the following:
        <pre>
2009/08/08 15:01:49.447|Lvl1|ReplicationService|||ReplicationService::HandleNetIDAssigned: Using Private Category Category(0xD00000001F003000)|
</pre>

        <p class="indent1">If you don't see a line like this, make sure you have created an
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">eon::ReplicationService</span> and added it to <span class=
        "NDLSystemFont">efd::ServiceManager</span>. Also make sure both producer and consumer are
        connected to an <span class="NDLSystemFont">efd::ChannelManager</span>. For more
        information on networking, see <a href="../Networking/sso_networking_intro.htm">Networking:
        Introduction</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Verify that producer and consumer processes are not creating entities with overlapping
    entity IDs. You can check this by looking at the following log statement in both the consumer
    and producer log files:
        <pre>
Producer log file:
2009/08/08 16:44:33.579|Lvl1|EntityManager|||EntityManager: Successfully added &lt;EntityID=(0xF13800<span class="CodeHighLight">4</span>0000000F4)&gt; (PeerAvatar) owned=<span class="CodeHighLight">1</span>|
</pre>
        <pre>
Consumer log file:
2009/08/08 16:44:38.754|Lvl1|EntityManager|||EntityManager: Successfully added &lt;EntityID=(0xF13800<span class="CodeHighLight">6</span>0000000F4)&gt; (PeerAvatar) owned=<span class="CodeHighLight">1</span>|
</pre>

        <p class="indent1">Verify that the EntityIDs are different between processes. It is valid
        to have the same EntityID as long as only one process has "owned=1". If both processes are
        creating owned producer entities with overlapping IDs, make sure you are not creating any
        entities that you want to replicate until the tick after you have received the <span class=
        "NDLSystemFont">efd::AssignNetIDMessage</span>. See <a href=
        "../Networking/sso_networking_best_practice.htm">Best Practices for Working with
        Networking</a> for more information.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Verify that the source entity is getting created. Look for a log line on the producer side
    that is similar to the following:
        <pre>
2009/08/08 16:44:33.579|Lvl1|EntityManager|||EntityManager: Successfully added &lt;EntityID=(0xF1380040000000F4)&gt; (PeerAvatar) owned=1|
</pre>

        <p class="indent1">If you do not see a line like this in your producer log file, your
        producer entity was not created. For more information about creating entities, see <a href=
        "../Entities/entity_creating.htm">Creating entities</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Verify that the source entity has the correct properties in the correct property groups.
    Each property that you want to replicate should have a log line on the producer side that is
    similar to the following:
        <pre>
2009/08/08 15:01:56.421|Lvl1|ReplicationProducerEntity|||&lt;EntityID=(0xF13800400000007F)&gt; (PeerAvatar) discovering property 'PeerID' (705593358) in group 0 cleardirty=1|
</pre>

        <p class="indent1">If you do not see a line like this, see <a href=
        "sso_replication_config_groups.htm">Configuring Replication Groups</a> for details.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Verify that the source entity is using the correct categories for the correct property
    groups. Look for a log line on the producer side that is similar to the following:
        <pre>
2009/08/08 15:21:32.039|Lvl1|ReplicationGroups|||&lt;Group=0&gt;: Set &lt;EntityID=(0xF13800400000007F)&gt; replication channel to &lt;Channel=Category(0xC000007FF7013001)&gt;|
</pre>

        <p class="indent1">If you do not see a line like this, see <a href=
        "sso_replication_config_groups.htm">Configuring Replication Groups</a> for details.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Verify that data is being changed on the source entity. Under most replication policies,
    the data is only transferred if it changes. During prototyping or rapid iteration, you might
    have lua script errors or code problems that cause logic to stop prior to updating the source
    entity. Look for a log line on the producer side that is similar to the following:
        <pre>
2009/08/08 15:21:32.412|Lvl2|ReplicationProducerEntity|||&lt;EntityID=(0xF13800400000007F)&gt; (PeerAvatar) dirting property 'PeerID' (0x2A0E800E) in groups 0x00000001, prop=0A250118, RS=00000000|
</pre>

        <p class="indent1">If you do not see a line like this in your producer log, make sure you
        are actually setting the property that you want to change. See <a href=
        "../Entities/entity_debugging.htm">Debugging entities</a> for information on debugging
        entities.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Verify that the observing process has subscribed to the correct channels.
        <pre>
2009/08/08 15:01:55.748|Lvl2|ReplicationService|||Category(0xC000007FF7013001)| ReplicationService subscribing to new replication category|
</pre>

        <p class="indent1">If you do not see a line like this, see <a href=
        "sso_replication_config_groups.htm">Configuring Replication Groups</a> for details.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Verify that replication messages are received.
        <pre>
2009/08/08 16:44:38.836|Lvl2|ReplicationConsumerEntity|||UpdatePropertiesFromStream: &lt;EntityID=(0xF1380040000000F4)&gt; (PeerAvatar) group='0' prevSequence='0' sequence='1'|
2009/08/08 16:44:38.836|Lvl1|ReplicationConsumerEntity|||FromStream read &lt;EntityID=(0xF1380040000000F4)&gt; (PeerAvatar) propID=0x12383CEA name KfmAsset value=pProp-&gt;ToString().c_str()|
2009/08/08 16:44:38.836|Lvl1|ReplicationConsumerEntity|||FromStream read &lt;EntityID=(0xF1380040000000F4)&gt; (PeerAvatar) propID=0x2A0E800E name PeerID value=pProp-&gt;ToString().c_str()|
2009/08/08 16:44:38.836|Lvl2|ReplicationService|||Discover: &lt;EntityID=(0xF1380040000000F4)&gt; of type 'PeerAvatar' added to local cache.|
2009/08/08 16:45:01.997|Lvl2|ReplicationConsumerEntity|||UpdatePropertiesFromStream: &lt;EntityID=(0xF1380040000000F4)&gt; (PeerAvatar) group='0' prevSequence='1' sequence='2'|
2009/08/08 16:45:01.997|Lvl1|ReplicationConsumerEntity|||FromStream read &lt;EntityID=(0xF1380040000000F4)&gt; (PeerAvatar) propID=0x68C7C29D name Rotation value=pProp-&gt;ToString().c_str()|
2009/08/08 16:45:01.997|Lvl2|ReplicationService|||Update: &lt;EntityID=(0xF1380040000000F4)&gt; updated in local cache.|
</pre>

        <p class="indent1">If you do not see a line like this, see <a href=
        "sso_replication_config_groups.htm">Configuring Replication Groups</a> for details.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Verify that replica entities can be factoried. It is also possible that built-in model
    factories might be missing, and their absence prevents the replica entity from being created.
    If your entity has been successfully factoried, you will see a line in the consumer log similar
    to the following:
        <pre>
2009/08/08 16:44:38.237|Lvl1|EntityManager|||EntityManager: Successfully added &lt;EntityID=(0xF1380040000000F4)&gt; (PeerAvatar) owned=<span class="CodeHighLight">0</span>|
</pre>

        <p class="indent1">If you do not see a line like this, see <a href=
        "../Entities/entity_creating.htm">Creating entities</a> for details on how to create
        entities. (There is no difference in the requirements for creating replica entities or
        original entities.)</p>
