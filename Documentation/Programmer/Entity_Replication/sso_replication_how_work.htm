<h1>How Replication Works</h1>

<p>In Gamebryo LightSpeed, the Replication system uses the Replication Service (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/eon/eon__ReplicationService.htm">eon::ReplicationService</a></span>) and extends
the Entity Manager (<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/egf/egf__EntityManager.htm">egf::EntityManager</a></span>) with the Online Entity
Manager (<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/eon/eon__OnlineEntityManager.htm">eon::OnlineEntityManager</a></span>).</p>

<p>The Online Entity Manager registers an entity factory that creates one of two classes that
derive from <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/egf/egf__Entity.htm">egf::Entity</a></span>. To create an original producer
entity, the Online Entity Manager allocates a subclass called <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/eon/eon__ReplicationProducerEntity.htm">eon::ReplicationProducerEntity</a></span>.
To create an entity that is created as a result of replication (commonly referred to as a consumer
or replica entity), the Online Entity Manager creates an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/eon/eon__ReplicationConsumerEntity.htm">eon::ReplicationConsumerEntity</a></span>
instance.</p>

<p>Producer entities are for the most part treated just like entities (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">egf::Entity</span> instances). They are known as original or producer entities
because they are the original source of entity properties and can produce replication messages that
are sent to interested consumers. Original entities can have any of their properties changed as
normal. Each producer entity is automatically subscribed to its own entity ID (Entity private
Category) and will receive events (Behavior invocation requests) sent to its EntityID just like
entities (<span class="NDLSystemFont">egf::Entity</span> instances).</p>

<p>The Replication Service sends and receives replication messages. When a replication message that
discovers a new, previously unknown entity arrives, a consumer entity (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">eon::ReplicationConsumerEntity</span> instance) is created to cache the replicated
entity state. Consumer entities are not original, so their properties cannot normally be changed by
anyone other than the Replication Service itself (which will apply replicated state updates
automatically). However, properties that are marked with the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">mutable</span> property trait can be changed on a consumer. Note that mutable
property changes on consumers are not replicated to any other process, nor are they pushed back to
the original entity. Rather, they are stored locally only for the convenience of other locally
owned entities or services. Future replication updates will overwrite the local mutable value.
Unlike original entities, consumer entities do not subscribe to the entity ID (Entity private
Category) and will not receive event messages that are destined for the original producer
entity.</p>

<p>When a property changes on the original entity, the replication system marks that property as
dirty for all of the replication groups that are used by that property. Updates for those dirty
properties are sent to any process that consumes the category, and all matching consumer entities
are updated. The replication group policies determine how these updates are sent. All dirty
properties for each replication group on an Entity are sent in the same update message. This
ensures that all changes in one tick of a Behavior will be applied atomically to a consumer also
during a single update. There is no need to manually manage transactions because a Behavior tick
will never be interrupted. Typically, update messages are delivered in order when they are sent to
the same Category. However, there is no guarantee that updates from multiple entities will be sent
or received simultaneously, even if they were updated in the same tick.</p>

<p>Entities do not replicate without, first, doing some configuration. This is true because not all
properties of all entities should replicate (doing so would send more information than is
required). Instead, properties must be explicitly marked in the Entity Modeling Tool to indicate
which <em>replication group or groups</em> they belong to. A replication group is a group of
related entity properties that all replicate using the same usage pattern. For each entity
instance, a <em>category</em> can be determined by the producer to control who receives updates.
Each group has a specific <em>replication group policy</em> that is used for all entities. A
replication group policy determines when and how a replication group updates. Properties on
entities can be placed into one or more groups, and each replication group can update at a
different interval and with a different Quality of Service.</p>

<p>The Replication Service in the owning process applies the replication group policy to all owned
entities. That policy determines when and how update messages are sent and property dirtiness is
cleared. For example, you might configure a group to send out updates only once per second, which
means the dirtiness will only be cleared once per second. All properties set during that interval
will accumulate and go out in a single update after the timeout has expired. Typically, each group
has an update interval at which it sends an update message using a chosen Quality of Service. The
smallest interval is a single simulator tick that results in an update message each time the entity
changes any property. Only dirty entities are considered for replication, and only at the indicated
rate. Once the message is sent, the dirtiness is cleared just for the group that was updated. Each
producer entity stores per-property, per-group dirty information so that a property can be dirty in
multiple groups that update at different intervals. See <a href=
"sso_replication_config_groups.htm">Configuring Replication Groups</a> for details.</p>

<p>Producer entities must also have a category set for each replication group that they use. Each
owned entity instance can use a different category for each replication group. Many different
entities can also use the same category if they share the same set of interested consumers. For
example, this allows an entity that uses a replication group for geographical region to produce
replication messages to a category that is specific to the region that the entity is currently in.
Many entities might be in the same region and they would all use the same category for that
replication group. As the entity moves from one region to another, it would change the category
that is being used to the unique category for the new region.</p>

<p>To receive replication messages and keep replicated entities up-to-date in its cache, a process
must indicate interest in the various categories that the producer entities are being published
into. This can be done from code by calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">eon::ReplicationService::SubscribeReplicationChannel</span> or from script by
calling <span class="NDLSystemFont">bapiOnline.SubscribeReplicationChannel</span>. These methods
will subscribe the Replication Service to the given category and, if this is a new subscription,
will request initial discovery of any producer entities already publishing into the category.
Following this initial discovery, updates for any entities that produce into that category will be
sent automatically for as long as the category is subscribed. Note that this discovery and update
process operates for each replication group independently. Only those properties in a replication
group that is publishing to a category that is consumed by the current process will be transferred.
Any properties on the original producer entity that either do not have any replication group traits
set or are not publishing to a category we consume will have the default value as defined in the
flat model of the replica entity. If multiple replication groups are being consumed for the same
entity and we stop consuming just one of those groups, the properties from that group will retain
the last replicated value and will not revert to the default value. Finally, if we stop consuming
all of the categories that are used by a replica entity, then that entity will be lost and removed
from our cache. To stop consuming a replication category, use either <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">eon::ReplicationService::UnsubscribeReplicationChannel</span> from code or
<span class="NDLSystemFont">bapiOnline.UnsubscribeReplicationChannel</span> from script. Calls to
these methods are reference counted, so there must be an equal number of calls to unsubscribe for
each call to subscribe. See <a href="sso_replication_groups_categories.htm">Understanding
Replication Groups and Categories</a> for further details.</p>

<p>In addition to controlling what properties are published by producer entities, replication
groups can also have policies attached to them to control how the properties are updated. See
<a href="sso_replication_policies.htm">Understanding Replication Policies</a> for details.</p>
