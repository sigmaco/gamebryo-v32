<h1>Interpreting Metrics Logs</h1>

<p>There are several ways to analyze metrics log data. The most likely means is using a
number-crunching tool such as a spreadsheet or a SQL database. Parsing the log file format with a
scripting language such as Python or Perl should be straightforward. You can also use specialized
log-analysis tools, such as Splunk. For the purpose of this discussion, we will assume that you are
using a spreadsheet application, such as Microsoft Excel.</p>

<p>Metrics logs are emitted in text format. The log fields are separated by the pipe character
'|'.</p>

<p>The only fields you really need for metrics logging are the first one (timestamp) and the last,
which consists of a probe name and a value. The first thing you need to do is isolate the records
you care about. You do this by searching for the probe name. Note that the hierarchical nature of
the names makes it possible to "roll up" some data by filtering on only part of the probe name.
With the example data above, a search on SOCKET.SEND.BYTES.6.0x33A4110D7F000001 will track the
number of bytes sent on the connection with the ID 0x33A4110D7F000001. Removing the connection ID
will return bytes sent on all connections with Quality of Service 6 (TCP), and removing the QoS
will return bytes sent on all connections.</p>

<p>More complex searches are possible using more sophisticated string matching. A hypothetical
search for SOCKET.*.BYTES.6.* (where * is a wildcard) would return the total number of bytes sent
and received on all TCP connections, for example.</p>

<p>Some analyses require only counting the number of logged occurrences, but most will require you
to extract the associated values. This can be accomplished a couple of ways. It is simple enough to
preprocess the file (with Notepad, for instance), replacing " = " with "|" so the value will end up
in its own cell on import. If you don't want to split fields on "|", you could add an adjacent
column containing a formula that extracts the value to its own cell.</p>

<p>The technique for analyzing a particular metrics probe depends on the type of probe in
question:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Counter</b>&mdash;The most common type of probe, this "ticks" (logs a value of 1) each
    time a particular code section executes. To extract useful data from this type of probe, simply
    count the number of times it occurs in the log file.</li>

    <li><b>Time value</b>&mdash;Used for rudimentary profiling, this type of probe logs how much
    time has elapsed while executing a section of code. It is useful to graph this type of probe
    over time, to identify places where execution time spikes excessively.</li>

    <li><b>Running total</b>&mdash;Similar to a counter, but typically used to measure an
    allocatable resource. The counter is ticked up (with a value of 1) when a resource is
    allocated, and ticked down (value of -1) when a resource is freed. To analyze this type of
    counter, you should do a rolling sum at a regular time interval. This will show the allocated
    resources outstanding at any given point in time.</li>

    <li><b>Bytes value</b>&mdash;Usually used for networking; shows the number of bytes sent or
    received by the networking system. Summing these values over a regularly measured time interval
    (e.g. 1 second) gives a useful measure of how much data your game is attempting to push across
    the wire.</li>
</ul>
