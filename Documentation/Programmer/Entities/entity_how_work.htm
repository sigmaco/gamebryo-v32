<h1>How entities work</h1>

<p>Entities are implemented as C++ objects with a container of
IProperties that can be looked up by integer PropertyID or the
string name of the property. Each Entity has a data-driven FlatModel that is
associated with it. The FlatModel contains information about all of the
Models that are mixed in, including the behaviors that are available to execute
on that Entity. FlatModels also contain the default values for
all properties. The Entity does not actually have storage
dedicated to any properties unless they have changed from the
    Model default. If a property is changed from the default on a specific
Entity, a new Property is allocated in the Property container for that Entity 
    instance, and the new value is set. When looking up a property for reading,
the Property container is first checked to see if the Property has been changed. If no IProperty that matches the PropertyID is found, the default value is used from the FlatModel.</p>

<p>Entities can make use of built-in models. A built-in model is
similar to a regular Model that is data-defined in the Entity Modeling Tool
(and in fact built-in models are described in much the same way in
the Entity Modeling Tool). However, built-in models are linked to an object derived 
    from IBuiltinModel. IBuiltinModel is a C++ class that is
automatically created and attached to an Entity that mixes in the
    derived IBuiltinModel (as defined in the Entity Modeling Tool).
IBuiltinModel provides the ability to get and set properties that
are stored in native or custom data types. IBuiltinModel also provides a
dispatch mechanism for behaviors. All get and set property calls,
as well as behavior invocations, go through the IBuiltinModel.
This can be used for more efficient data storage, better
notification of property changes, and conversion between custom data
types and the data types already bound into script. Built-in Models are ideal for 
    integrating to existing game code and exposing those legacy Entities into EMT 
    and World Builder. Legacy Entities can then be laid out, tuned and can interact 
    with newly created data-driven Entities.</p>

<p>Entities can be manipulated by themselves, other Entities, or
system services. There are APIs for directly getting and setting
properties and invoking behaviors from C++. Behaviors are usually invoked
by calling an API that sends a message to the Scheduler. The
Scheduler then queues the behavior for execution on the specified
Entity. In <span class="NDLSystemFont">Scheduler::OnTick</span>, the Scheduler decides which
behaviors to run on which Entities based on the Category of the request, 
    subscriptions on the Entity, and the behaviors available to the Entity. Not all behaviors for all
Entities will necessarily run each tick. Behaviors can be queued
with a delay time after which they are to be executed. Also, each
Entity has a tunable limit on the number of concurrent behaviors that can
be run on it for resource management reasons. If an Entity already has too many behaviors running
on it, any pending behaviors will remain queued until one of the
executing behaviors finishes.</p>

<p>Behaviors can call <span class="NDLSystemFont">Entity::CallImmediateBehavior
    </span>from C++ or
BehaviorAPI.CallBehavior from Lua (if the behavior is marked
with the immediate trait) to invoke a behavior as a nested blocking call. A
behavior that is invoked in this way will run immediately without being
queued on the Scheduler. When the call to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Entity::CallImmediateBehavior </span>from C++ or
BehaviorAPI.CallBehavior from Lua returns, the behavior has
completed and execution immediately continues in the caller. Behaviors that are marked with the immediate trait
cannot sleep or call any *AndWait built-ins.</p>

<p>It is possible to directly call any C++ function from C++
behaviors and any Lua function from Lua behaviors. However, 
we do not recommend directly calling a function that is a behavior. 
The only safe way to call a function that is a behavior is to use 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">Entity::CallImmediateBehavior </span>from C++ or
BehaviorAPI.CallBehavior from Lua. Both use the
appropriate rules for resolving which behavior to call. Both call all appropriate behaviors if the Extends trait is set.</p>
