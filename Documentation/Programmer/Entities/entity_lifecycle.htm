<h1>Entity lifecycle</h1>

<p>After it is created, an entity transitions through several phases. These phases are called
lifecycles. Each lifecycle event has a related behavior that is called when that lifecycle
executes. These behaviors are some of the most important starting points for behavior authors to be
aware of. In addition to invoking these behaviors, the lifecycle also interacts with the Entity
Manager (<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_entity_mgr.htm">efd::EntityManager</a></span>) and
with any built-in model implementations that are mixed into the entity.</p>

<h2>Entity-specific lifecycle behaviors</h2>

<p>Various models can implement these lifecycle behaviors. By default all lifecycle behaviors are
extends-style behaviors. So, it is easy to add new behavior to the existing behavior of the models
that you mix-in.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>OnCreate</b>&mdash;Called after the entity has been created and added to the Entity
    Manager. It is recommended not to spend too long in OnCreate or to block in this behavior for
    excessive amounts of time. Instead, consider sending yourself another behavior event in which
    non-setup related logic can be run. The OnCreate behavior accepts a ParameterList to hold any
    additional arguments needed by the entity.</li>

    <li><b>OnAssetsLoaded</b>&mdash;This lifecycle is called after all assets that are preloaded by
    the entity have finished loading. To preload assets you must mix in the <a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Preloadable.htm">Preloadable</a> model.
    The <a href="../../Reference/egf/egf__EntityManager.htm">entity manager service</a> checks the
    PreloadAssets property after executing the OnCreate behavior. This lifecycle is always invoked
    after preloading completes, even when the entity opts out of preloading (either by not mixing
    in Preloadable or by setting PreloadAssets to False). This behavior is where you are first able
    to use any asset data that an entity requires, such as registering for animation text key
    callbacks or interacting with other .nif or .kfm attributes. When this behavior completes, the
    initial OwnedEntityAddedMessage will be sent out locally by the Entity Manager so that various
    system services can discover the newly created entity.</li>

    <li><b>OnEntitySetFinished</b>&mdash;Called after all entities in the same entity set have had
    OnCreate called. All the entities that are loaded from the same block file are loaded as a
    single entity set. Entities that are created independently (in other words, not as part of a
    block file) still have this lifecycle called as soon as they finish the OnCreate lifecycle.
    This is the first place where you can safely interact with other entities in the same block
    file, knowing that they have been fully created. There is no guarantee as to the order in which
    OnAssetsLoaded and OnEntitySetFinished will be called.</li>

    <li><b>OnEnterWorld</b>&mdash;Called after the entity has entered the world. Before entering the
    world an entity will not be rendered or physically simulated. Behaviors with the 'In World Only'
    trait set will only execute on Entities after they have entered the world.</li>

    <li><b>OnExitWorld</b>&mdash;Called after the entity has exited the world. The entity is still
    valid and can have behaviors without the 'In World Only' trait set called. The entity can enter
    and exit the world multiple times before being destroyed.</li>
    
    <li><b>OnDestroy</b>&mdash;Called just before the entity is destroyed. This is where you would
    do any required cleanup, such as destroying any dynamic child entities that were created by
    this entity. When the OnDestroy lifecycle is completed, the entity will be automatically
    removed from the Entity Manager. All of the state for the entity is still completely valid
    during the OnDestroy behavior but you can no longer queue any new behaviors on the current
    entity after it has reached the OnDestroy lifecycle.</li>
</ul>

<p>These lifecycle behaviors are invoked when they are created as replica entities.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>OnDiscovery</b>&mdash;Called after the replica entity has been created and added to the
    Online Entity Manager. This is the replica entity equivalent to the OnCreate behavior.</li>

    <li><b>OnReplicaAssetsLoaded</b>&mdash;This lifecycle is called after all assets that are
    preloaded by the entity have finished loading. This is the replica entity equivalent to the
    OnAssetsLoaded behavior.</li>

    <li><b>OnFinalLoss</b>&mdash;Called just before the replica entity is destroyed. This is the
    replica entity equivalent to the OnDestroy behavior. This happens when the producer entity in
    the owning process is destroyed. It also happens when the process unsubscribes from the last
    replication group of the entity, not on every replication group loss.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional built-in model-specific entity hooks</h2>

<p>Built-in models can implement lifecycle behaviors just like any other mixed-in model, but they
have a few extra methods that are useful for interacting with system services. These are not
behaviors, they are simply virtual methods on the IBuiltinModel interface that can be overridden by
the final built-in model implementation.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>OnAdded</b>&mdash;Called immediately after the entity that contains the built-in model
    has been added to the Entity Manager or Online Entity Manager, but before the
    OnCreate/OnDiscovery lifecycle has been called. This is the first opportunity for your built-in
    model implementation to interact with other system services or entities. Services may wish to
    hold smart pointer references directly to the built-in model rather than the parent entity. In
    such an event, this method is the first place where it is valid to store these references.</li>

    <li><b>OnRemoved</b>&mdash;Called as the entity that contains the built-in model is being
    removed from the Entity Manager or Online Entity Manager and after the OnDestroy/OnFinalLoss
    lifecycle has completed. If any system services are holding references directly to the built-in
    model implementation, they must be released in this method.</li>
</ul>
