<h1>Entity In/Out of World State</h1>

<p>One of the most important concepts for managing entities is the "world state". An entity can
either be "in the world" or "out of the world" at any given point in it's life span and can
transition between these two states as needed. Here we discuss what exactly this means and how it
affects simulation and rendering.</p>

<h2>What does it mean to be "in the world"?</h2>
<p>The simulation of an entity is controlled by many different system services that spend CPU cycles
processing each relevant entity. In general the majority of these services should only concern
themselves with entities that are in the world. For example, services such as the rendering service
and the the various PhysX services will not spend any CPU cycles on out-of-world entities. This
means those entities will not render to the screen and cannot trigger PhysX collisions, for example.
These services can still discover new entities as soon as they are created; they might use this
ability to load various resources or prepare for the entity to enter the world. Services should
be able to very quickly transition an entity into the in-world state when requested. However
services should strive to avoid spending CPU time on out-of-world entities. For example, when an
entity that mixes in the Mesh standard model is created the relevant mesh and textures are loaded
into memory and the appropriate scene graph nodes to represent the entity are created but these
nodes are not added to the scene graph until that entity enters the world. Once added to the scene
graph the entity will immediately be available for rendering.</p>
<p>All of the property state for an entity is maintained when an entity is moved between in-world
and out-of-world states. In addition, if desired the properties of an out-of-world entity can still
be modified. This allows for many features such as implementing reusable pools of entities for
things like short lived projectiles or explosion animations and optimizing which entities are active
based on proximity to the player or visibility. Also, the actual transition to or from the world
will trigger entity lifecycles which can execute behaviors on the entities as described in the
<a href="entity_lifecycle.htm">Entity Lifecycles</a> documentation.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In versions of LightSpeed prior to version 3.2 entities automatically entered the world as soon
as they were created and there was no way to manually move an entity in or out of the world. This
made it difficult to control the preloading of entity sets as each entity would pop into the world
one-by-one as they finished asyncronous entity creation. Also there was no easy way to preload a
set of entities without impacting CPU utilization which made it difficult to stream in additional
entities in large streaming worlds. To easy upgrading from previous versions, by default entities
are still automatically entered into the world as soon as they are created. However it is now
recommended that this default behavior be overridden and applications manually control entry into
the world to best suit their needs.</p>

<h2>Controlling Entity World State</h2>

<p>There are several ways to control the world state for entities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>By default entities will enter the world as soon as they are created. This is done to
        match legacy behavior.</li>
    <li>When dynamically creating an entity you can manually specify whether it should enter the
        world automatically once created.</li>
    <li>When loading a block you can manually specify whether all entities in the block should
        automatically enter the world.</li>
    <li>Specific entities can be told to enter to exit the world from C++ or script.</li>
    <li>All entities loaded in a block can be told to enter or exit the world from C++ or script.</li>
    <li>When an entity is destroyed it will automatically exit the world first if needed.</li>
    <li>The default behavior of entering or exiting the world for both blocks and dynamically
        created entities can be adjusted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Controlling initial world state for dynamically created entities</h3>
<p>There are several ways of creating an Entity in C++ and from script but in all of these cases
the general method of controlling whether or not an entity should automatically enter the world is
the same. This is controlled via a specific named parameter that is passed in during creation of
the entity. When an entity is first created you can pass a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a
href="../../Reference/efd/efd__ParameterList.htm">ParameterList</a></span> containing arguments for
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnCreate</span> behavior. These parameters now include one specific
parameter that controls entering the world, the "<span class="NDLSystemFont">AutoEnterWorld</span>"
parameter is a boolean value that controls whether the entity should enter the world automatically.
If no parameters are provided then this parameter will automatically be added with a default value,
otherwise the value of this parameter is checked by the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a
href="../../Reference/egf/egf__EntityManager.htm">EntityManager</a></span> when the entity is added.
As a conveniance this parameter is then passed on to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnCreate</span>
behavior along with any other parameters. The following examples demonstrate setting <span
class="NDLSystemFont">AutoEnterWorld</span> to the non default value of 'false'.</p>
<h4>C++ example of creating an out-of-world entity:</h4>
<pre>
    // Note: If you are only using this single argument for many entity creations you may wish to
    // cache a single ParameterList with this argument and reuse it for each entity creation.
    ParameterListPtr spCreationArguments = EE_NEW ParameterList;
    spCreationArguments->AddParameter("AutoEnterWorld", false);
    // Add additional arguments for creation if desired. Remember, you should always use only named
    // parameters when invoking any 'extends' style behavior.

    // Using the preferred EntityManager::CreateEntity method:
    EntityManager* pEntityManager = m_pServiceManager->GetSystemServiceAs&lt;EntityManager&gt;();
    pEntityManager->CreateEntity("ModelName", efd::kCAT_INVALID, spCreationArguments);
</pre>
<h4>Lua script example of creating an out-of-world entity:</h4>
<pre>
    local creationParams = ParameterList.ParameterList()
    creationParams.PutBool("AutoEnterWorld", false)

    BehaviorAPI.CreateEntity("ModelName", creationParams)

    -- Works the same with the "AndWait" version of entity creation:
    BehaviorAPI.CreateEntityAndWait("ModelName", creationParams)
</pre>

<h3>Controlling initial world state during block loading</h3>
<p>When loading a block you can control whether all entities in that block are automatically entered
into the world or not. By default all entities are automatically entered into the world as soon as
every entity in the block is fully created. Internally the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a
href="../../Reference/egf/egf__EntityLoaderService.htm">EntityLoaderService</a></span> will
automatically create the neccessary <span class="NDLSystemFont">ParameterList</span> with the <span
class="NDLSystemFont">AutoEnterWorld</span> parameter set accordingly.</p>
<h4>C++ example of loading a block out-of-world:</h4>
<pre>
    EntityLoaderService* pELS = m_pServiceManager->GetSystemServiceAs&lt;EntityLoaderService&gt;();
    egf::BlockLoadParameters blp;
    blp.SetAutoEnter(false); // This false specifies not to automatically enter the world
    pELS->RequestEntitySetLoad("urn:emergent-world:YourBlockName", &blp);
</pre>
<h4>Lua script example of loading a block out-of-world:</h4>
<pre>
    local blockLoadParams = ParameterList.ParameterList()
    blockLoadParams.PutBool("AutoEnter", false)
    BehaviorAPI.LoadBlockFile("urn:emergent-world:YourBlockName", blockLoadParams)
</pre>

<h3>Manually adjusting world state for a single entity</h3>
<p>Given a pointer or script reference to an entity it is a simple matter to move that entity in or
out of the world.</p>
<h4>C++ example of moving an entity in or out of the world:</h4>
<pre>
    Entity* pEntity = ...;
    
    // EnterWorld can be called at any time, if called before the OnCreate lifecycle has completed
    // this request will be queued and will run as soon as it is valid to do so. If the entity is
    // already in the world this will have no effect:
    pEntity->EnterWorld();

    ...

    // ExitWorld can also be called at any time. If the entity is not in the world this will do
    // nothing. If the entity is partially through entering the world then it will complete the
    // entering process and then immediately exit the world.
    pEntity->ExitWorld();
    
    // An entity can enter and exit the world as many times as needed:
    pEntity->EnterWorld();

    // If an entity is destroyed while it is in the world it will automatically exit the world
    // before invoking the destruction lifecycle.
    EntityManager* pEntityManager = m_pServiceManager->GetSystemServiceAs&lt;EntityManager&gt;();
    pEntityManager->DestroyEntity(pEntity);
</pre>
<h4>Lua script example of moving an entity in or out of the world:</h4>
<pre>
function MyBehavior(self, params)
    BehvaiorAPI.EntityEnterWorld(self)  -- enter the world
    BehaviorAPI.Sleep(1000)             -- sleep for a second
    BehvaiorAPI.EntityExitWorld(self)   -- leave the world
    BehaviorAPI.Sleep(1000)             -- sleep for a second
    BehvaiorAPI.EntityEnterWorld(self)  -- re-enter the world
    BehaviorAPI.Sleep(1000)             -- sleep for a second
    BehvaiorAPI.DestroyEntity(self)     -- destroy myself thus leaving the world
end
</pre>

<h3>Manually adjusting world state for an entire block</h3>
<p>Every entity created as result of loading a block file can be moved in or out of the world just
as easily as updating a single entity's world state.</p>
<h4>C++ example of moving a block in or out of the world:</h4>
<pre>
    // NOTE: The AssetID used here must be the exact AssetID used when the block was loaded.
    EntityLoaderService* pELS = m_pServiceManager->GetSystemServiceAs&lt;EntityLoaderService&gt;();
    pELS->RequestEntitySetEnterWorld("urn:emergent-world:YourBlockName");

    ...

    // Note: again the AssetID must match the one used when loading the block.
    pELS->RequestEntitySetExitWorld("urn:emergent-world:YourBlockName");
</pre>
<h4>Lua script example of moving a block in or out of the world:</h4>
<pre>
function MyBehavior(self, params)
    -- As always, the AssetID must match that used when loading the block.
    BehvaiorAPI.EntitySetEnterWorld("urn:emergent-world:YourBlockName")
    BehaviorAPI.Sleep(1000)
    BehvaiorAPI.EntitySetExitWorld("urn:emergent-world:YourBlockName")
end
</pre>


<h3>Changing the default auto-enter world behavior</h3>
<p>The default response for both blocks and dynamically created entities is to automatically enter
the world when created. These defaults are set mainly for legacy compatability with previous
versions of LightSpeed. You can override these global defaults to prevent entities from
autoamtically entering the world (unless, of course, they manually request entering the world
through any of the methods discussed above). If you change these defaults, it is recommend this be
done during your application initialization before any blocks or entities are created. It is not
recommended that these settings be changed more than once. In particular changing these settings
while blocks are loading may have undefined and potentially harmful side effects.</p>
<h4>Turning off "auto-enter" for blocks:</h4>
<pre>
    BlockLoadParameters::SetDefaultAutoEnterWorld(false);
</pre>

<h4>Turning off "auto-enter" for dynamic entities:</h4>
<pre>
    EntityManager* pEntityManager = m_pServiceManager->GetSystemServiceAs&lt;EntityManager&gt;();
    pEntityManager->SetDefaultAutoEnterWorld(false);
</pre>
