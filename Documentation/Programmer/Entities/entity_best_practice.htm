<h1>Best practices for working with entities</h1>

<h2>When to use an entity</h2>

<p>To make the best possible use of the entity mechanism it is important that you decide what
should be modeled as an entity. Not every detail in the game should be modeled as a separate
entity. Doing so could lower system performance with no gain in game design. However, it is
surprisingly useful to model unanticipated things as an entity to make them tunable and available
to be changed at run time. For example, game UI, ambient audio effects, and so on. It is worth
giving considerable forethought to what needs to be modeled as an Entity versus a visual effect,
and how.</p>

<ul>
    <li>An entity should have more than one possible state. If a tree has any dynamic game state,
    for example if it can be cut down or burned, then it should be modeled as an entity. This true
    even if the Entity has no encapsulated behavior.</li>

    <li>An entity should be a <b>significant</b> concept in the game world. Not every rock in a
    rock pile or gold coin in a bag needs to be represented as a separate entity. Instead a rock
    pile might be an entity with a property that represents the number of rocks in the pile. Then
    again if the player does not interact with the rock pile at all then it might not be its own
    entity at all and should be baked into the terrain. A bag might be an entity that has a
    property that represents the number of gold coins that it contains rather than containing
    another entity to represent the pile of coins or a collection of single-coin entities. But if
    individual pieces of loot need to be maintained, the bag should contain a collection property
    of type EntityRef.</li>

    <li>The representation of a logical entity can be made to change during game play. For example,
    coins on the ground can be destroyed after increasing the counter in the player's gold
    bag.</li>

    <li>Not every entity that you model needs to be a physical thing. It can represent an abstract
    concept or general world statistic. For example, the weather might be an entity with changing
    state that affects game play even though it is not directly visible. The current quest a
    character is on could be an entity with its own state and behaviors to track quest progress or
    to trigger events.</li>

    <li>AI coordination and planning might best be modeled as a central "planner" entity that tells
    groups of NPC's how to form up and attack. That would be easier than building the planning
    aspect of AI into each NPC and then developing a coordination conversation. A central planner
    might also be more easily tuned. On the other hand, carrying out the orders and reacting to the
    environment would almost certainly be best done by each NPC to give a more realistic
    non-uniform experience.</li>

    <li>Further, Entities should be developed using object oriented principles where each will
    internally encapsulate the state and behaviors needed to present the desired external interface
    to the game world. Using Models and mixing, complex inheritance, polymorphism, and reuse of
    entity code is possible.</li>

    <li>Some Entities will have a completely fixed set of property at run time. For example a tree
    might never change state and whose purpose is only to provide scenery and perhaps inhibit
    movement. At edit time, these static Entities are individually editable and relocatable in
    World Builder. An Entity that meets this static definition could eventually be "baked" into the
    scene and not consume resources as a runtime Entity.</li>

    <li>Having a single global Entity can be useful to expose tuning values. A global Entity per
    level or per game region can be useful for scripting the sequence of actions that challenge the
    player, or doing initial set up.</li>

    <li>You should plan for fewer than a few thousand entities being created at a time and fewer
    than a few hundred being active. Beyond that point, the game would need to use streaming to
    flush less relevant content or in some way suspend the execution of the unwanted entities.
    These estimates of course are dependent on what language is used and how complex the Behaviors
    are, and should be measured for your specific game.</li>

    <li>Note that inactive entities have a memory overhead, but have compute overhead only when a
    behavior is scheduled for them. For this reason we strongly recommend against ticking an Entity
    every frame but instead using an event driven approach. One change in thinking is that the
    animation system can update the appearance and possibly the location of the entity per frame
    while the behavior system more infrequently sets the goals.</li>

    <li>Entities should be somewhat long-lived to reduce creation and initialization overheads. A
    missile would make sense, but a particle or a bullet from a chain gun would probably be
    inappropriate. In an extreme situation, a developer could consider reusing an entity by using a
    free-list mechanism to avoid repeated creates and destroys.</li>

    <li>Animated articulated parts of a character are probably not appropriate to be represented as
    entities. But dynamically snapped-on parts or weapons may make sense. Using that mechanism, the
    separate character and weapon entity would be able to cooperate in computing damage and other
    game effects as opposed to overloading the character entity with all conceivable combat
    logic.</li>

    <li>Consider referring to an Entity in C++ via their associated EntityID not directly via a
    stored pointer. The Entity may be destroyed before you reuse that pointer. Some kinds of rapid
    iteration (for example, deleting the entity in World Builder) can invalidate the Entity
    pointer. If you use a SmartPointer, you should listen for entity-destroyed messages to unset
    the direct reference.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating and destroying entities</h2>

<p>If you need to create a set of related entities, consider creating a block file to represent the
set. Blocks can be loaded and unloaded to create and destroy the contained entities. They are much
more convenient for rapid iteration, since only change deltas are executed. This is in contrast to
scripting and reexecuting the creation of a complex set of entities using a Behavior.</p>

<p>Entities created dynamically at runtime that do not have strict timing requirements should be
created using <span class="NDLSystemFont">egf::EntityManager::CreateEntity</span> from C++ or the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">BehaviorAPI.CreateEntity</span> or <span class="NDLSystemFont">
BehaviorAPI.CreateEntityAndWait</span> functions available in script. This ensure all the
dependencies (behavior scripts, models, assets, etc) needed by the entity are also loaded.</p>

<p>When dynamically creating entities that have strict timing requirements, you should preload the
entity flat model and any assets required by the entity prior to instantiating the entity. You
should also disable automatic asset preloading by setting the 'AssetPreload' flag from the
Preloadable mix in model to 'False'. To further reduce potential delays, the entity flat model
should not define the OnCreate or OnAssetsLoaded lifecycle behaviors.</p>

<p>When you know the flat model has already been loaded, you can use <span class="NDLSystemFont">
egf::FlatModelManager::FactoryEntity</span> method from C++ or the <span class="NDLSystemFont">
BehaviorAPI.SpawnEntity</span> method from script to immediately create an entity. The returned
entity will not have begun the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnCreate</span> behavior yet and may not
have all required assets available, which means it may not work with all built-in API methods.
However, you can immediately read and write property values or queue behaviors on the created
entity.</p>

<p>When dynamically creating entities you are responsible for managing their eventual destruction.
If one entity creates another entity during a behavior, consider having the parent entity keep
track of the child with an EntityRef property. This way the parent can destroy the child during the
parent's OnDestroy behavior. Alternatively, the created entity could destroy itself in response to
some event or a system service could track the dynamic entities.</p>

<p>If you pass a callback category to <span class="NDLSystemFont">egf::EntityManger::CreateEntity
</span>, you should subscribe to the callback category in advance. If you subscribe to the callback
category in the same tick in which you call <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateEntity</span>, your
message handler may not be called for the newly created entity.</p>

<h2>Switching Levels</h2>

<p>To switch levels in multi-level games it is recommended that block files be used.</p>

<ul>
    <li>We recommend using a system service to manage game state transitions such as level changes.
    Such a service is a logical place to manage the loading and unloading of block files and assets
    associated with a level.</li>

    <li>A single level may consist of more than one block file. The designer may want to create
    sections of the game world that can be reused in multiple levels. Or they could load a section
    incrementally as the player moves through. For example:

        <ul>
            <li>Unload block file(s) for the current level using the EntityLoaderService. Unloading
            a block file destroys all entities created by that block file causing all of their
            OnDestroy behaviors to run. If those statically created entities track and destroy ones
            they dynamically created, all outstanding entities will disappear when unloading the
            block file.</li>

            <li>Load block file(s) for next level. When all entities from this new block are fully
            created you will receive a callback notification.

                <ul>
                    <li>OnEntitySetFinished is an entity lifecycle behavior. It is invoked on each
                    entity in the block file that implements one after all entities in the block
                    have completed their OnCreate behavior.</li>

                    <li>elr_EntityCreationComplete is a message that is sent at the same point and
                    can be subscribed to in a game service that needs to know when the entities
                    have finished OnCreate.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
