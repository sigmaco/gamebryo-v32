<h1>SwapBuffers Slowdown</h1>

<p>If an application experiences slowdowns in <span class="NDLSystemFont">SwapBuffers</span>, 
 it is most likely not the process of swapping buffers that is slowing 
 your application down. An application that stalls in <span class="NDLSystemFont">SwapBuffers</span> 
 is usually waiting on the GPU to finish rendering all of the objects that 
 have already been sent down the pipeline. In this case, one must determine 
 where the GPU is slowing down.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Functional Units of a GPU</h2>

<p>While every GPU is different, they all have similar 
 functional units. It is convenient to discuss things like the vertex pipeline 
 and the pixel pipeline for each GPU. Depending on your platform, you may 
 have more specific knowledge or tools to profile into your GPU. This document 
 seeks to give a brief description of how to determine where a GPU is slowing 
 down. Note that on Xenon, the vertex 
 and pixel pipeline share shader units making some of this discussion irrelevant.</p>

<h3>Parts of a GPU</h3>

<p>What are the parts of a GPU with which we must be concerned? 
 For the sake of an abstract discussion, let's break the GPU up into a 
 data bus, a vertex processing unit and a pixel processing unit. The bus 
 handles getting the vertex data down to the GPU or in some cases getting 
 the texture data down to VRAM. The vertex processing unit handles all 
 of the per vertex calculations on the GPU. These calculations include 
 transformation, lighting, texture coordinate generation, clipping, and 
 culling. On a programmable hardware, vertex shaders replace the fixed 
 functionality of a vertex processing unit. The pixel processing unit handles 
 all the rasterization, texturing, and alpha blending. On a programmable 
 hardware, all of the code executed by pixel shaders falls into this area.</p>

<p>Once you see a slowdown in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SwapBuffers</span> 
 function, the next thing to do is determine where in the GPU you are bound. 
 Since the GPU is a pipeline, a slowdown in one section can slow everything 
 down.</p>

<h3>Bus Slowdowns</h3>

<p>Bus slowdowns are some of the hardest slowdowns to diagnose. 
 On PC, you can try running on the same graphics card on different speed 
 AGP buses or PCI-E buses. Also consider trying to compress vertices or 
 textures to reduce the impact on the bus. The less data you have to transfer 
 while maintaining the amount of stress on the vertex and pixel units can 
 point to a speed up. Make note that depending on the architecture of your 
 console, compressed data may take additional time in the vertex or pixel 
 unit which can make such profiling difficult. If your application is data 
 bus transfer bound, you have to find ways to reduce the amount of data 
 transferred by reducing texture sizes, compressing data, or simplifying 
 meshes. On programmable hardware, consider recomputing any values that 
 you may be transferring. For example, consider recomputing the binormal 
 in a vertex shader rather than packing it and transferring it.</p>

<h3>Vertex Processing Unit Slowdowns</h3>

<p>Slowdowns in the vertex unit come from processing too 
 many vertices or from doing too much work per vertex. Determining these 
 slowdowns can be fairly easy. If you can send a simplified mesh down the 
 pipeline, that is the easiest way. You must make sure that it has the 
 same screen coverage, however, to maintain the load on the pixel processing 
 unit. Another approach is to eliminate any dynamic lighting on the object. 
 Dynamic lighting takes up clock cycles in the vertex unit. If you turn 
 off lights and the application suddenly speeds up, you are bound to some 
 degree in the vertex processing unit. On programmable hardware, try simplifying 
 your vertex shaders, and see if there is a change in application performance.</p>

<h3>Pixel Processing Unit Slowdowns</h3>

<p>Slowdowns in the pixel processing unit can be a little 
 more difficult to determine than in the vertex processing unit. The reason 
 for this is that you can be bound computationally or by memory access. 
 Texture sampling requires memory bandwidth to a texture cache on the GPU 
 or to main memory to fetch a texture. One way to test this is to replace 
 all textures in your application with a small 2x2 texture. Since this 
 texture is so small, you will almost always hit in the texture cache. 
 If this speeds up your application, consider reducing the size of some 
 textures until you get the performance that you desire. If reducing texture 
 size does not speed up your application, try reducing the number of textures 
 on an object or reducing the computational complexity of programmable 
 shaders. Eliminate all textures except for a base map, or reduce you programmable 
 shader to simply output the base map sample. In this way, you can determine 
 if the pixel processing is slowing you down independent from the texture 
 sampling. If pixel processing is slowing you down, you need to try and 
 reduce the number and complexity of pixels drawn to the screen by either 
 reducing the number of textures per object or by reducing overdraw.</p>

<p>nVidia supplies an excellent tool for profiling performance 
 slowdowns in rendering on PC. NVPerfHUD will show you a variety of statistics 
 and allow you to toggle settings such as rendering with only a 2x2 texture, 
 rendering with a null viewport, and enabling or disabling various levels 
 of shader support. A screenshot of an NVPerfHUD enabled application is 
 below. For information on NVPerfHUD, please visit the NVPerfHUD <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/nvperfhud_home.html" target="_blank">homepage</a>
