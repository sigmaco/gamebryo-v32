<h1>Threading and Smart Pointers</h1>

<p>One of the greatest pitfalls for any thread safety scheme 
 is reference counted pointers like Gamebryo's smart pointers as pointed 
 out in a <a href="PerformanceImpacts.htm">previous section</a> of this 
 document. The internal reference counting mechanisms for <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRefObject.htm">NiRefObject</a></span> 
 based objects are thread safe in Gamebryo. This does not mean that all 
 smart pointer operations are thread safe in these cases. Specifically, 
 race conditions can still occur when there are both smart pointer and 
 regular pointer references to the same object.</p>

<p>Imagine an example where an object is created in a foreground 
 thread and stored in smart pointer. The reference count on the object 
 is now 1. A background thread is running and requests a pointer to the 
 object. Since this is a regular pointer, the background thread goes to 
 store the object in a smart pointer. At about the same time, the foreground 
 thread releases its smart pointer to the object. At this point, we have 
 a race condition. If the background thread manages to increment the reference 
 count first to 2, the object will not be deleted and will remain valid 
 when the foreground thread decrements the count to 1. If the foreground 
 thread decrements first to zero, the object will be deleted and the background 
 thread will try to perform an increment on the reference count of a deleted 
 object.</p>

<p>A race condition like this illustrates the danger of 
 shared objects in any concurrent execution system. Developers can avoid 
 these situations in Gamebryo by making sure that every thread using a 
 reference counted object does so via a unique smart pointer. Ideally, 
 that smart pointer is owned by some object which also owns the executing 
 thread so that the smart pointer can be guaranteed to persist longer than 
 the thread. For example, in background loading, smart pointers may reference 
 a shared texture palette. That palette exists before the background thread 
 is created by the stream and after it terminates.</p>

<h2>Thread Safety and Performance</h2>

<p>Assuring the thread safety of reference counted objects 
 can have impacts on performance. Because these safety features are only 
 necessary or useful in multithreaded applications, developers of single 
 threaded applications may desire to disable this feature. Disabling this 
 thread safety feature simply requires changes to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRefObject::IncRefCount</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRefObject::DecRefCount</span> in <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiRefObject.inl</span>. The safe version of the code 
 is listed below.</p>
 
<pre>
inline void NiRefObject::IncRefCount()
{
    NiAtomicIncrement(m_uiRefCount);
}
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
inline void NiRefObject::DecRefCount()
{
    if (NiAtomicDecrement(m_uiRefCount) == 0)
        delete this;
}
</pre>

<p>Simply replace the atomic increment and decrement function 
 calls with direct increment and decrement operations to disable thread 
 safe reference counting.</p>

<pre>
inline void NiRefObject::IncRefCount()
{
    ++m_uiRefCount;
}
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
inline void NiRefObject::DecRefCount()
{
    if (--m_uiRefCount == 0)
        delete this;
}
</pre>
