<h1>How NIF File I/O Works</h1>

<p>At its highest level, a Gamebryo file contains a list of
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiObject.htm">NiObject</a></span>-derived
objects that have been "streamed" to disk. This technique is
called streaming because the complex structure of the objects has
been reduced to a linear stream of information, represented by a
NIF file.</p>

<p>Because these objects may have data members that point to
other such objects, an implicit directed graph relates all the
objects. The object pointers are the graph's arcs.</p>

<p>The greatest challenge in implementing streaming is to be able
to save the objects to disk with the appropriate information
about the graph's arcs, sequentially load the objects, and
recreate the directed graph. Building the graph after all objects
have been loaded essentially requires linking in the sense that
we are used to in linking modules into an executable program.</p>

<p>The Gamebryo streaming system is unlike that of serialization
used in the Microsoft Foundation Class library. In the latter
case, a depth-first traversal of a graph is applied. Any
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiObject.htm">NiObject</a></span> data
members that are visited will call their own serialization
routines immediately. Other native data members (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">int</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">float</span>, etc.) are streamed as they are
encountered.</p>

<p>In the case of Gamebryo streaming, the objects are streamed in
a more breadth-first fashion (although scene graphs are traversed
in depth-first order). Any <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiObject.htm">NiObject</a></span> data
members that are encountered do not call their own streaming
routines. An actual pointer value is written to disk. The
corresponding object may or may not have already been written to
disk.</p>

<p>When loading the objects, the pointer values are no longer
valid memory addresses. They are instead used as link IDs to be
used in a later linking pass. <a href=
"../Object_Systems/Introduction_to_Object_Systems.htm">Object
Systems</a> describes the architecture and features in more
detail.</p>
