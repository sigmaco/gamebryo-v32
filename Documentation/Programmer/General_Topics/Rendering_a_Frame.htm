<h1>Rendering a Frame</h1>

<h2>The High-level Process of Rendering</h2>

<p>Rendering is the process used to draw an application's desired
scene to the screen (or other framebuffer output, such as a
rendered texture). At its highest level, rendering a scene
involves:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ensuring that the scene objects are placed/animated
    appropriately for the current situation being simulated by
    the application</li>

    <li>Setting up the desired view/camera from which the scene
    will be rendered</li>

    <li>Determining which parts of the scene are visible in the
    view</li>

    <li>Clearing the output device</li>

    <li>Drawing the visible parts of the scene to the output
    device</li>

    <li>Displaying the result</li>
</ul>

<p>Gamebryo is extremely flexible in how it allows applications
to actually implement the rendering of a frame. Many
applications will do very few of the steps explicitly, relying
instead on functions like the global utility function
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDrawScene</span> to handle most of
the low-level stages. However, in order to explain the overall
architecture, we will discuss all of the steps in a basic
pipeline first. The pages that are hyperlinked from here will
discuss the basics of each step, and then branch off to two other
cases; the convenience functions that simplify the most common
rendering cases, and the more advanced examples of manual
rendering used for complex effects.</p>

<h2>The Objects used for Rendering</h2>

<p>There are several objects that form the basis for rendering,
either as sources, processes, or destinations. These objects
will be mentioned briefly in this section, although many of them
have already been introduced for one reason or another in an
earlier section.</p>

<p><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span></a>: This base class for all
scene graph objects is of interest to us because the hierarchical
scene graph is the data structure that organizes all of the items
to be rendered. Applications may have a single, monolithic scene
graph for their entire 3D world, or they may have several
independent scene graphs that are to be rendered independently to
form the visible world.</p>

<p><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderObject.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span></a>: This base class for
all renderable scene graph objects and is a subclass of
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject.</span> Culling will
output a list of these objects, which will then be rendered by
invoking the abstract <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RenderImmediate</span> method. All of the other
nodes in the scene graph hierarchy exist only for purposes of
scene grouping and hierarchical animation.</p>

<p><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span></a>: These are actually a subclass
of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span>, but are of
particular importance here because they are the most common
derivation used in Gamebryo. Once we move into rendering proper,
these are the objects we will use.</p>

<p><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiCamera.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span></a>: The camera's role in
rendering is nothing more than to provide the view and projection
transforms. The camera defines the view of the scene for culling
and rendering purposes. Note that the camera is not the focal
point or manager of rendering, and it does not contain links to
scenes, renderers, etc.</p>

<p><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiCullingProcess.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span></a>: The culling process
is the object responsible for generating a list of visible
renderable objects, based on a scene graph and a camera.</p>

<p><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class="NDLSystemFont">
NiAccumulator</span></a>: This optional (but extremely common)
object serves as a final post-processing pass between renderable
objects and rendering. It is often used to sort the visible
objects.</p>

<p><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderer.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderer</span></a>: The 3D rendering device
itself, it is the renderer that is called upon to draw the
renderable objects to the destination buffer.</p>

<p><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderTargetGroup.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderTargetGroup</span></a>: The final
destination of the rendered objects - the buffer (or buffers, as
the "group" refers to the fact that shaders can render to more
than one pixel buffer simultaneously) of pixels that will be
drawn by the renderer. There is one "special" render target
group; the on-screen framebuffer. All applications will write to
this render target group - other, more advanced applications may
also render to far more groups for textures, etc.</p>

<h2>Conceptual Dataflow for Rendering</h2>

<p>The basic dataflow of rendering is shown below to give an idea
of how the various "process" objects (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderer</span>) use and generate the rendering
"data" objects (<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span>
objects, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span>
objects, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderTargetGroup</span>) in order
to render the scene. The wide, gray-filled objects in the diagram
are the "process" objects, and the major "data" items that they
pass between them are the white-filled objects. The data flows
from the original scene and camera at the top down to the render
target group at the bottom. Note that some more minor objects are
a part of this dataflow. However, the basic architecture of how a
scene graph and a camera turn into rendered pixels is given
below.</p>

</div>

<h2>Logical Rendering Steps</h2>

<p>The actual set of steps that must be taken to render a frame
to the screen is slightly more involved than the high-level
discussion or dataflow implied, as there are additional steps
required to inform the renderer of the target and mark the
beginning and end of rendering. The linked pages below will
describe the basic functionality used to render common scenes,
and then discuss advanced forms of each rendering step.</p>

<ol style="list-style: decimal; list-style-type: decimal;" type=
"1">
    <li>Prepare the Scene for Rendering
        
        <p class="indent1">This step includes several operations that are
        designed to ensure that all of the leaf geometry objects
        contain up-to-date rendering information. Cumulatively,
        we call these processes <a href=
        "Preparing_a_Scene_for_Rendering.htm">Preparing a
        Scene for Rendering</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Define the View
        
        <p class="indent1">The camera's view must be updated, as both culling and
        rendering require a view. The functions used to define
        the view (as well as a discussion of how viewing works in
        Gamebryo) may be found in the section <a href=
        "Viewing_Meshes.htm">Viewing Meshes</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Collect Visible Objects
        
        <p class="indent1">Gamebryo stores its scenes in hierarchical scene
        graphs including both internal grouping nodes and
        geometry-bearing leaf nodes. The rendering process only
        involves flat lists of visible leaf renderable objects. 
        The process used to collect the visible leaf objects from
        a hierarchical scene graph into a flat rendering list is
        called culling, and it is described in the section
        <a href="Culling_a_Scene_Graph.htm">Culling a Scene Graph
        into a Visible Array</a>. Note that this step can be
        done at any time after this point, as long as it is done
        prior to sorting and rendering the geometry below.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Begin the Current Frame
        
        <p class="indent1">The rendering of a frame truly begins by directing the
        renderer object to begin the next frame. This process is
        described in the section <a href="Using_Frames.htm">Using
        Frames</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Open the Render Target
        
        <p class="indent1">Before we can render objects, we must inform the
        renderer of the desired destination (or set of pixels on
        the device) to which the rendering should be done. This
        step normally involves clearing this target. The
        destinations are Render Target Groups, and are described
        in the section <a href=
        "Using_Render_Target_Groups.htm">Using Render Target
        Groups</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Pass the View to the Renderer
        
        <p class="indent1">The renderer must be given the camera's view and
        projection information in order to render from the
        correct viewpoint. The functions used to define the view
        (as well as a discussion of how viewing works in
        Gamebryo) may be found in the section <a href=
        "Viewing_Meshes.htm">Viewing Meshes</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Sort and Render the <span class=
        "NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span> objects
        
        <p class="indent1">This extended step involves actually rendering arrays
        of visible leaf objects to the device. It also includes
        any sorting or final preprocessing that is to be applied
        to the objects to be rendered. These steps are described
        in the section <a href="Rendering_Meshes.htm">Rendering
        Meshes</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Close the Render Target
        
        <p class="indent1">Once all of the desired renderable objects have been
        rendered to the device, we must inform the renderer that
        we have completed all rendering to the current render
        target. This is described in the section <a href=
        "Using_Render_Target_Groups.htm">Using Render Target
        Groups</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>End and Display the Current Frame
       
        <p class="indent1">These steps inform the renderer that we have finished
        all rendering for the current frame and are ready to
        display it to the screen. This is described in the
        section <a href="Using_Frames.htm">Using Frames</a>.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples of the Frame Rendering Sequence</h2>

<p>Two examples of the sequence discussed above are the main
rendering system in the Gamebryo application framework's
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication::OnIdle</span> and the
functions called within (which may be found in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiApplication.cpp</span>) and in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SimpleApp</span>. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SimpleApp</span> in particular shows most of
these steps in their most basic form, back-to-back. Note that in
both cases, the above steps 3, 6 and 7 (culling, passing the view
to the renderer, and sorting/rendering) are all accomplished via
the rendering utility functions discussed below.</p>

<h2>Drawing Utility Functions</h2>

<p>Applications that only render a single scene graph to a render
target each frame and do not need any special behavior beyond
basic or sorted rendering can often avoid having to take all of
the above steps explicitly by using the global utility function
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDrawScene</span>. In addition,
applications that use advanced rendering methods such as culling
several independent scene graphs into a single visible array
(i.e. doing stage 3 several times in succession during a single
rendering pass) or rendering the same visible array several times
without re-culling (i.e. reusing the result of stage 3 for
several frames) can also take advantage of the drawing utility
functions to avoid duplicated code. The section <a href=
"Drawing_Utility_Functions.htm">Drawing Utility Functions</a>
details the high level behavior of these functions.</p>
