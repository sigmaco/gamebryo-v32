<h1>The Mathematics of Skinning</h1>

<p>Skinning allows developers to create deformed meshes using weighted matrices that define the
relation of a vertex to various bones. Because it may be necessary to include skinning in a custom
pixel or vertex shader, it is necessary to understand the mathematics of skinning. The following
sections explain the base mathematics of skinning as well as the particulars of the Gamebryo
implementation which operates in world space rather than root parent space to avoid unnecessary
extra calculations.</p>

<h2>Skinning Defined Mathematically - Local Space Skinning</h2>

<p>The following description defines the calculations that are used to deform vertices and normals
in a skinned object. Given the index, <b>i</b>, of a particular bone, a transformation,
<b>M</b><sub><b>i</b></sub> , for that bone is calculated as follows:</p>

<p><b>M<sub>i</sub> = M<sub>rp-s</sub> * M<sub>b-rp</sub><sup>i</sup> *
M<sub>s-b</sub><sup>i</sup></b></p>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>M<sub>s-b</sub><sup>i</sup></b> transforms bind-pose vertices and normals from the
    coordinate system of the skinned object to the coordinate system of bone <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">b.</span></li>

    <li><b>M<sub>b-rp</sub><sup>i</sup></b> deforms bind-pose vertices by transforming them from
    the coordinate system of bone <span class="NDLSystemFont">b</span> to the coordinate system of
    the root bone parent, using the current object transformations.</li>

    <li><b>M<sub>rp-s</sub></b> transforms deformed vertices from the coordinate system of the
    parent of the root bone back to coordinate system of the skinned object.</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, it may seem that these transformations combine to form an identity matrix,
since they transform from the skin's coordinate system to bone <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">b's</span> coordinate system, and then back again to the skin's coordinate system.
They do not combine to form an identity matrix, however, because the vertices are transformed from
the coordinate system of the skin to the coordinate system of bone <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">b</span> using <em>bind pose</em> transformations, and then transformed from bone
<span class="NDLSystemFont">b</span>'s coordinate system to the coordinate system of the root
bone's parent using the <em>current</em> transformations of all the bones in the hierarchy from
bone <span class="NDLSystemFont">b</span> to the root bone parent, and then finally from the root
bone parent's coordinate system back to the skin's coordinate system using <em>bind pose</em>
transformations.</p>

<p>Having defined how a transformation matrix for each bone is calculated, we can define how these
transformations are combined to calculate final vertex positions and normal vectors for a skinned
object. Suppose a particular vertex is influenced by two bones, whose indices are <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">0</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">1</span>, and that the weight of bone
<span class="NDLSystemFont">0</span> is <span class="NDLSystemFont">w0</span>, and the weight of
bone <span class="NDLSystemFont">1</span> is <span class="NDLSystemFont">w1.</span> Note that the
sum of <span class="NDLSystemFont">w0</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">w1</span> must be
<span class="NDLSystemFont">1.0</span>. If the bind-pose position of the vertex is <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">v</span>, then the deformed vertex position is:</p>

<p><b>w0 * M<sub>0</sub> * v + w1 * M<sub>1</sub> * v</b></p>

<p>This formula extends naturally to vertices that are influenced by any number of bones.</p>

<p>Bind pose normals are deformed in the same way, except the scales are factored out of the
transformation matrices, and, since the above equation does not produce normals that are of unit
length even if the bind pose normals are of unit-length, the normals produced by the deformation
code are re-unitized.</p>

<h2>Gamebryo's Implementation of Skinning - World Space Skinning</h2>

<p>Although the mathematics above can be directly implemented in a game engine, Gamebryo adds some
additional steps to the skinning algorithm to optimize calculation. Most notably, Gamebryo performs
skinning in world space. This change of space allows the use of the existing world transforms of
the bones rather than calculating the transform of the bone to root parent space each frame. A full
discussion of the matrices and other data employed by Gamebryo is below.</p>

<h3>Skinning Algorithm in Gamebryo</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Start with a vertex, <b>V</b>, in the bind pose in local skin space. This data is held by
    the <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm"><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span></a>
    object representing the skin and will be packed directly into a vertex buffer for hardware
    accelerated skinning. For simplicity, we'll assume this vertex is only affected by one bone and
    drop the numerical index, <b>i</b>. As noted above, however, multiple bones can be used.
    Weights for vertex-bone interactions are stored in an <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> with the BLENDWEIGHT common semantic.</li>

    <li>Apply a skin-to-bone matrix <b>M<sub>s-b</sub></b>. This static matrix is calculated per
    bone during export, and describes the relationship between the bone, in bind pose, and the
    skin. The vertex is now in "bone space". This transformation is stored in an <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSkinningMeshModifier</span>, accessible through the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">GetSkinToBoneTransforms</span> member function.</li>

    <li>Apply the bone's world transform <b>M<sub>b-w</sub></b>. This transform accounts for the
    bone's animation, and it has been calculated in advance by the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm#UpdateFunctions">NiAVObject::Update</a></span>
    function.. The vertex is in world space, but the transform of the skin itself hasn't been taken
    into account. Note in the mathematics described above, we would take the vertex to root parent
    space rather than world space. Taking the vertex to root parent space, however, would require
    recalculating the bone to root parent matrix each frame. Instead, we use the already calculated
    world transform of the bone and factor the additional transform from root parent to world space
    out in later steps.</li>

    <li>Apply a world-to-skin transform, <b>M<sub>w-s</sub></b> . This transform is calculated from
    two matrices. The first matrix is calculated during export to describe the relationship between
    root parent the skin and the bones and the skin itself. This transformation is accessible
    through the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSkinningMeshModifier::GetRootBoneParentToSkinTransform</span>. The second
    matrix is the inverse of the root parent's current world transform. Now the vertex is once
    again in local skin space, but this time the positions of the bone have been factored in. If
    skinning is done in software, this is the point where the deformed skin can be packed into a
    vertex buffer and rendered as a static object.</li>

    <li>Apply the skin's world transform <b>M<sub>world</sub></b>, just like any other mesh. This
    puts the deformed vertex in world space.</li>

    <li>Apply the view <b>M<sub>view</sub></b> and projection <b>M<sub>projection</sub></b>
    matrices, as usual to project the vertex into clip space for the graphics card.</li>
</ol>

<p>Concatenating all these matrices together produces:</p>

<p>
<b>V<sub>final</sub>=M<sub>projection</sub>*M<sub>view</sub>*M<sub>world</sub>*M<sub>w-s</sub>*M<sub>
b-w</sub>*M<sub>s-b</sub>*V</b></p>

<h3>Vertex Shader Considerations</h3>

<p><b>M<sub>s-b</sub></b> and <b>M<sub>b-w</sub></b> are the only matrices the only ones that vary
per bone. To reduce the amount of work done per vertex in shaders, Gamebryo combines those into one
matrix which can be called <b>M<sub>bone</sub></b>. <b>M<sub>w-s</sub></b> and
<b>M<sub>world</sub></b> vary per skin, so those can be combined into <b>M<sub>skin</sub></b>.
<b>M<sub>view</sub></b> and <b>M<sub>projection</sub></b> are calculated by the renderer per camera
and can be combined as <b>M<sub>viewproj</sub></b>. Therefore, the string of multiplies in a vertex
can be condensed to:</p>

<p><b>V<sub>final</sub>=M<sub>viewproj</sub>*M<sub>skin</sub>*M<sub>bone</sub>*V</b></p>

<p>Note that this equates to 3 matrix multiplies per vertex. In order to reduce the amount of work
done in the vertex shaders even further, the <b>M<sub>skin</sub></b> matrix can be provided to the
vertex shaders premultiplied by one of the other two matrices. If you want to do lighting, you'll
need to transform your normals appropriately into world space, so you'll want to multiply the
<b>M<sub>skin</sub></b> matrix by each <b>M<sub>bone</sub></b> matrix to produce
<b>M<sub>boneskin</sub></b>. This will give you this set of transforms:</p>

<p><b>V<sub>final</sub>=M<sub>viewproj</sub>*M<sub>boneskin</sub>*V</b></p>

<p>This is implemented in Gamebryo by using the shader constant SKINBONEMATRIX3 and multiplying it
by the VIEWPROJ matrix in the shader.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could get better performance on the CPU by multiplying the
<b>M<sub>skin</sub></b> matrix by the <b>M<sub>viewproj</sub></b> matrix to produce
<b>M<sub>skinviewproj</sub></b>. Since both values are constant for a given draw call, you will
have a single matrix multiply instead of one matrix multiply per bone. The down side is that the
vertex shader wouldn't be able to transform normals into world space. This combination gives
you:</p>

<p><b>V<sub>final</sub>=M<sub>skinviewproj</sub>*M<sub>bone</sub>*V</b></p>

<p>This is implemented in Gamebryo by using shader constant BONEMATRIX3 and multiplying it by the
SKINWORLDVIEWPROJ matrix in the shader. For more information on using shader constant maps to
access these bone matrices, please refer the <a href="../NiShader/Shader_Constant_Maps.htm">NSF</a>
