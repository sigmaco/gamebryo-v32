            should be used. Almost all asset types are background loaded by default in the
            Game Framework. The following discussion applies only to applications built

<p>The background loading system is designed to transparently 
 provide safe, threaded loading to the user. It is important, however, 
 to understand some of the performance implications of this system as the 
 background threads can cause <a href="PerformanceImpacts.htm#Priority_Inversion">priority 
 inversion</a> if used incorrectly.</p>

<h2>Restrictions on Background Loading</h2>

<p>The Gamebryo background loading system is designed to 
 take care of most thread safety issues for you, but there are some restrictions 
 that should be obeyed by the user to guarantee optimal behavior. For more 
 information on using background loading you can refer to the <a href="../Object_Systems/Streaming.htm#Background_Loading">object 
 system documentation</a>.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Only one NIF file should 
 be loading at any given time. This insures access to static stream resources 
 is moderated. Additionally, there is little performance benefit for having 
 multiple NIFs loading concurrently since they will generally all block 
 on the same disk. In internal tests, there were negligible performance 
 benefits to having multiple streams running on a hard drive based system.</li>
	
	<li>After the NIF file 
 is loaded, make sure that the appropriate update calls are made to update 
 the scene graph, properties, and effects. </li>
	
	<li>Since the background 
 threads are created with lowered priority, the main thread should call 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/Platform_Independent_Wrappers_For_System_Routines.htm">NiSleep(unsigned 
 int)</a></span> to yield time to the background thread, except on multiprocessor 
 machines.</li>
	
	<li>The texture palette 
 for the background thread should not have <a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiDefaultTexturePalette.htm">global 
 sharing</a> via the texture list enabled as this could cause the system 
 to reference an uninitialized pointer in some rare cases.</li>
	
	<li>Although the use of 
 multiple background streams is not recommended, supported, or guaranteed 
 to be thread-safe, if an application chooses to use multiple background 
 streams, it should not share an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturePalette.htm">NiTexturePalette</a></span> 
 object between the streams. Doing so could cause improper deletion of 
 texture resources.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cancelling</h2>

<p>Cancelling a stream with <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm#BackgroundLoad">NiStream::BackgroundLoadCancel</a></span> 
 ceases the background load at the next available opportunity and frees 
 any resources used in loading. If the stream is loading objects, this 
 will cause a cancellation after the current object is loaded. Once a stream 
 is linking, however, cancellation cannot occur until all linking has occurred. 
 This necessity occurs because between <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStream::LinkObject</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObject::PostLinkObject</span> there exist 
 intermediate states where it is not safe to delete objects. Since <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiObject::PostLinkObject</span> must occur after <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiObject::LinkObject</span> is called on every object, 
 cancellation must wait on this occurrence as well.</p>

<p>This dependency means that it will actually take longer 
 to cancel a stream that has reached the linking phase rather than finishing 
 the load since not only will the streaming procedure largely finish, but 
 you will pay to delete the objects. The benefit to cancellation is that 
 you are guaranteed that the stream will cease disk activities shortly 
 after calling <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm#BackgroundLoad">NiStream::BackgroundLoadCancel</a></span>. 
 Deletion of stream resources will occur in the background thread and will 
 not touch the disk allowing you to start another background load at your 
 discretion without fear of competition for disk resources by the cancelled 
 stream.</p>

<h2>Pausing</h2>

<p>Pausing can be useful to a developer who wants to load 
 another stream in the background but does not want any contention for 
 the disk. Background loading streams can be paused at any time between 
 operations on an object. The stream will pause after the current call 
 to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObject::LoadObject</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObject::LinkObject</span>, 
 or <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObject::PostLinkObject</span> finishes.</p>

<h2>NiStream::BackgroundLoadOnExit Callback</h2>

<p>This callback should be used to finalize the objects 
 loaded by the streaming system in the background. Developers are encouraged 
 to precache geometry, update the scene graph, or update properties. These 
 activities should be thread safe in the engine. Developers should also 
 be aware of other potential places where thread safety could be an issue. 
 These concerns will be outlined in subsequent sections.</p>
