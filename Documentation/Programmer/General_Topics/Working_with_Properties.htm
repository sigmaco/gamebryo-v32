<h1>Working with Properties</h1>

<p>Gamebryo defines the rendering state for each leaf renderable
object via a set of independent rendering properties. Each of
these properties defines a particular aspect of the rendering
state for that renderable object, and each are subclasses of the
base <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiProperty</span> class. 
Rendering properties can be shared among multiple renderable
objects. The overall rendering state for a given object is the
property state (cached in an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPropertyState</span> object that is attached to
each <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span> object),
which is a collection of exactly one of each type of property. 
While the property state objects exist on <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span> leaf nodes, the individual
rendering properties themselves are attached to any <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span> in a scene graph. It is these
per-<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span> properties that
are used to generate the property state objects on each leaf
renderable object (via the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateProperties</span> process described
below).</p>

<p>A property that is attached to an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm#Properties">NiAVObject</a></span> affects all child objects in the
sub-tree under that <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span>
(including the object itself), until they are overridden by
another property of the same type lower in the sub-tree. If no
properties of a given type are pushed at or above an object in a
scene graph, then that object will be drawn with the default
property of that type applied. The default for each property type
is equivalent to the settings of a default-constructed property
of that type (see the documentation for each property class for
details regarding the default settings for that property
type).</p>

<p>Each <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm#Properties">NiAVObject</a></span>
contains a list of all of the properties that are attached to
it. An <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span> may have no
properties attached, or may have one or more properties attached,
all the way up to a maximum of one of each type of property
attached to a single <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span> . Note that applications must
take care to ensure that any single <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm#Properties">NiAVObject</a></span>
has no more than one property of a given type attached at any
time. Having more than one property object of a given type
attached to a single <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm#Properties">NiAVObject</a></span>
can result in strange visual artifacts and undefined
behavior.</p>

<h2>Rendering Property Types</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiProperty</span> object
hierarchy in the Gamebryo database is as follows:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObject<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NiProperty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NiAlphaProperty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NiDitherProperty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NiFogProperty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NiMaterialProperty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NiShadeProperty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NiSpecularProperty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NiStencilProperty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NiTexturingProperty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NiVertexColorProperty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NiWireframeProperty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NiZBufferProperty</span></p>

<p>A high-level description of each property type may be seen in
the section <a href="Property_Descriptions.htm">Property
Descriptions</a>.</p>

<h2>Updating Properties onto Geometry Objects</h2>

<p>As discussed above, properties compose from the root downward
towards the leaves hierarchically. A property that is attached
to an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm#Properties">NiAVObject</a></span>
will affect that object and any children of that object, unless
overridden by another property of the same type lower down in the
sub-tree. As a result, the current state of a leaf renderable
object is defined by its chain of ancestors in the scene
graph.</p>

<p>Gamebryo keeps the attached properties throughout the scene
graph, but also keeps record of the overall <em>property state</em>
at each leaf renderable object. The property state attached to
each leaf renderable object is an array containing the property
of each type that is applied at that object (based on a traversal
of the scene graph). In this way, each leaf renderable object
contains direct pointers to all of the render properties needed
to draw it. This is important, since the rendering phase deals
only with the leaf renderable objects, not the scene graph. The
property state object at each leaf renderable object is thus a
snapshot of all of the properties inherited by the renderable
object.</p>

<p>To update these property state objects, Gamebryo uses a system
similar to that used by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject::Update</span> function. The analogous
rendering property call is <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject::UpdateProperties</span> .
<span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateProperties</span> must be
called (before the next rendering call) on an object "O" (or any
of its ancestors) when any of the following occurs:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A scene graph rooted at O is initially created</li>

    <li>A property is attached or detached from O</li>

    <li>O is detached from or attached as a child of a parent
    object P</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that applications do <em>not</em> need to call
<span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateProperties</span> if <em>only
the settings within a given property</em> or <em>properties</em>
are changed (e.g. a new image is attached to an existing texture
property or the "testing" flag of an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiZBufferProperty</span> changes).</p>

<p>For optimal performance, these calls to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateProperties</span> can and
should be "batched" in the same way that calls to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> are batched. If the application
will be attaching and detaching numerous properties in a given
sub-tree, it should make all of the attach/detach calls, and then
make a single call to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateProperties</span> at the top of the
sub-tree. Generally, since properties and children are attached
and detached much less frequently than every frame, this call to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateProperties</span> is much
faster than accumulating the properties every frame. However, it
does place a small, added burden on the application
programmer.</p>
