<h1>Texture-based Dynamic Effects</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDynamicEffect.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDynamicEffect</span></a> subclass <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm">NiTextureEffect</a></span>
implements projected multitexturing. These types of effects are
very powerful tools for creating complex spotlights, light
shafts, stained-glass window effects, reflective surfaces,
projected shadows, and other effects. The effects involve
projecting a texture onto objects in the scene using a projection
other than the camera view.</p>

<p>As <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDynamicEffect.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDynamicEffect</span></a> subclasses, <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span></a> objects include
support for affected node lists and effect switches. As derived
objects of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a></span>,
they can be attached to scene graph objects to simulate
headlights, laser sights, and other effects.</p>

<h2>Texture Effect Type</h2>

<p>The texture type setting in an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm">NiTextureEffect</a></span>
controls the type of visual effect the texture has upon the
surface appearance of the textured objects in its affected node
scope list. The possible options include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">PROJECTED_LIGHT</span> . The
    set of active projected light <a href=
    "../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm"><span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span></a> objects sum
    together along with the static DarkMap multitexture. This sum
    is multiplied by the base texture of the object. As a result,
    the overall effect can only darken the base texture, but the
    lights themselves sum together in a physically realistic
    manner. Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of
    projected lights that can be active on an object, but most
    renderers impose some form of limit (either fixed or
    performance limited)</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">PROJECTED_SHADOW</span> .
    Each projected shadow <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm">NiTextureEffect</a></span>
    is multiplied by the base texture. As a result, each
    additional shadow map can only darken the base texture, and
    overlapping shadows will tend to darken the base object more
    deeply than disjoint shadows. Theoretically, there is no
    limit to the number of projected shadows that can be active
    on an object, but most renderers impose some form of limit
    (either fixed or performance limited).</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">ENVIRONMENT_MAP</span> . The
    environment map represents the mirror-like reflection of the
    surrounding environment in the surface of an object. The
    effect is added to the lit and shadowed base texture. An
    optional static multitexture, the GlossMap, may be specified
    to determine which parts of a surface are reflective. This
    allows complex behavior, such as a surface that is matte in
    some regions and shiny in others. Only one environment map at
    a time may be applied to a given surface.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">FOG_MAP</span> . The fog map
    represents the density (in its alpha channel) and the color
    (in its color channel) of the fog at a given height and
    distance from the camera. It is blended onto the final color
    of the surface, and is capable of making an entire object
    disappear into the fog. Only one fog map at a time may be
    applied to a given surface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Texture Coordinate Generation</h2>

<p>Dynamic texture coordinate generation is the heart of the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm">NiTextureEffect</a></span>.
The automatic dynamic generation of texture coordinates
determines whether the effect appears to be a spotlight, a
sunbeam, or the reflection of the surrounding scene. Three
settings control this behavior: the texture model-space
projection matrix, the model-space texture projection
translation, and the texture coordinate generation type.</p>

<p>The texture coordinate generation type controls the basic
source texture coordinates and the type of transform applied:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">WORLD_PARALLEL</span>: This
    mode takes as its inputs the world-space object vertices,
    transforms them by the world-space projection matrix and
    translation, and uses the X and Y components of the output as
    U and V. This mode tends to create parallel projections for
    sunbeam/infinite/directional lighting effects.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">WORLD_PERSPECTIVE</span>:
    This mode takes as its inputs the world-space object
    vertices, transforms them by the world-space projection
    matrix and translation, and uses the X/Z and Y/Z components
    of the output as U and V. This mode tends to create
    perspective transformations for spotlight or "movie
    projector" effects.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">SPHERE_MAP</span>: This mode
    transforms camera-space object normals into texture
    coordinates using a spherical projection. This is used to
    create environment-mapping effects.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedCubeMap</span>- and
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSourceCubeMap</span>-based
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span> objects:
    In this mode, texture coordinates are generated for each
    affected object by transforming the world-space object-normal
    vectors directly into the texture as a cube map . this
    capability is detailed in the <a href=
    "../Texturing/Introduction_to_Texturing.htm">System Details
    -- Texturing</a> manual, but is generally used for diffuse
    environment mapping and projected lights. This mode is only
    supported for <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedCubeMap</span>- and <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSourceCubeMap</span>-based <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span> objects on hardware
    that supports cube mapping.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">SPECULAR_CUBE_MAP</span>: In
    this mode, texture coordinates are generated for each
    affected object by transforming the world-space reflection
    vectors directly into the texture as a cube map this
    capability is detailed in the <a href=
    "../Texturing/Introduction_to_Texturing.htm">System Details
    -- Texturing</a> manual, but is generally used for specular
    environment mapping and projected lights. This mode is only
    supported for <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiRenderedCubeMap</span>- and <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSourceCubeMap</span>-based <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span> objects on hardware
    that supports cube mapping.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the world transforms of an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm">NiTextureEffect</a></span>
affect the generation of texture coordinates in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WORLD_PARALLEL</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">WORLD_PERSPECTIVE</span> mode. The specified
model projection matrix and translation specify a mapping from
the model-space of the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm">NiTextureEffect</a></span>
into texture space. The world scale, rotate and translate
transforms of the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm">NiTextureEffect</a></span>
are used to transform the respective model-space transformations
that map world-space vertices into texture space.</p>

<h2>Other Documentation and Examples</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm">NiTextureEffect</a></span>
class is detailed in the <a href=
"../Texturing/Introduction_to_Texturing.htm">System Details
Texturing</a> manual, one of the Programmer's Guide sections. The
Texturing manual includes discussion of how to configure common
texture transform matrices, as well as how to use the texture
filter, clamping, and texture type settings to create various
common effects. It also details the multitexture pipeline itself,
including the placement of each type of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm">NiTextureEffect</a></span>
in the pipeline.</p>

<p>The <a href=
"../../Learn/Demos/StandardMaterial_Demo_Overview.htm">StandardMaterial</a>
demo demonstrates several examples of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTextureEffect.htm">NiTextureEffect</a></span>-based
effects in both code and artwork.</p>

<h2>Fogging</h2>

<p>Fog, also known as haze or "depth cueing", is conceptually
related to lighting, but is functionally independent in Gamebryo.
Fog is a rendering effect available on some rendering systems
that causes objects to gradually fade to a single "fog color" as
they get further away from the camera's position. This has the
practical effect of making distant objects appear "hazy", and is
often used to make a close-in far clipping plane appear less
jarring (as objects will fade into invisibility instead of being
abruptly clipped).</p>

<p>There are three modes for fog in Gamebryo; two use the classic
"fog increases with distance from the camera" method of fogging,
while the third allows the application to specify any fog value
at any vertex. Fog is controlled in Gamebryo by the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiFogProperty.htm">NiFogProperty</a></span>
rendering property described later in this chapter.</p>

<p>Depth-based fog in Gamebryo is modified with a single
parameter that is related to the nearest distance from the camera
at which objects begin to be faded to the fog color. Objects
always attain the full fog color at the far plane. Currently, the
Direct3D renderers support fogging that is linear with respect to
Z value. Some platforms also support "range squared" fog. Please
see the platform renderer documentation for more details on each
renderer's capabilities. Range squared fog is more accurate (as
it is dependent on view position, not orientation), but is more
expensive to compute.</p>

<p>Note that the depth parameter is independent of actual near
and far plane values. A depth value of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">0.0</span> indicates that there is no fogging
(<span class="NDLSystemFont">0.0</span> should never actually be
used as a fog depth), while a depth of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">1.0</span> indicates that fogging should start at
the near plane. Values between <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">0.0</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">1.0</span> will linearly interpolate the near
fogging distance between the near and far planes.</p>

<div class="NDLFigureContainer">
    <img src="images/image014.jpg" width="438" height="135" alt=
    "Depth-based Fog (Linear Fog) (9K)">

    <p class="NDLFigureCaption">Depth-based Fog (Linear Fog)</p>
</div>

<p>While most applications will want 100% fogging at the far
plane, some renderers can support fogging to less than 100% at
the far plane when using range- or z-based fogging. This maximum
fog value can be set using <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderer::SetMaxFogValue</span>. See the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMain</span> Class Reference
manual's section on <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderer.htm">NiRenderer</a> for
details on this feature, and how to determine if a renderer can
support it.</p>
