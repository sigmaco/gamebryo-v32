<h1>Viewing Meshes</h1>

<p>Rendering involves not just the geometry layout of the scene,
but also the geometry of the viewer relative to the scene.
Gamebryo represents the visible scene via the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span>-based scene graph and the
viewer via an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span> object.
An <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span> is a subclass of
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span>, so it has its own
set of local transforms, and can inherit parent transforms if it
is attached in a scene graph hierarchy. The viewer is fixed in
the camera's model space, and is thus transformed along with the
camera object. Transforming the camera (either directly or by
moving a parent node) will transform the viewer accordingly.</p>

<p>Applications may keep a basically unlimited number of cameras,
either attached to a scene graph or held directly by the
application with no geometric parent. This allows the application
to "cut" from camera to camera as desired by chosing different
cameras from frame to frame. Also, multiple cameras may be used
within the same frame in order to render to offscreen textures,
etc.</p>

<p>The section <a href="Cameras.htm">Cameras</a> details the
exact camera model that Gamebryo uses, including a discussion of
view frusta and parallel and perspective projections. However,
the basic view defined by any Gamebryo camera is as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The center of projection (the viewpoint) is the
    model-space origin of the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span></li>

    <li>The projection plane is perpendicular to the model-space
    X axis of the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span></li>

    <li>In almost all cases, the camera view direction is
    centered about the model-space positive X axis of the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span> (the only
    exception is a perspective camera whose frustum is not
    symmetric)</li>

    <li>The "up" direction on the screen or in the destination
    framebuffer is the model-space positive Y axis of the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span></li>

    <li>As a result of the other definitions, the "right"
    direction on the screen or in the destination framebuffer is
    the model-space positive Z axis of the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span></li>
</ul>

<p>This basic camera orientation is shown in the figure
below:</p>

<div class="NDLFigureContainer">
    <img src="images/Viewing.gif" width="480" height="360" alt=
    "Viewing (3K)"> 
    <!-- <p class="NDLFigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
</div>

<p>Mathematically, we can map an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span> object G's vertices into a
camera V's model space described above by concatenating the
model-to-world matrix of G (we call this G<sub>MW</sub>) with the
inverse model-to-world (i.e. world-to-model) matrix of V (we call
this V<sub>MW</sub>). The first matrix transforms the vertex from
the model space of the geometry into world space, and the second
matrix transforms the vertex from world space into the model
space of the camera:</p>

<p><b>View Space = V<sub>MW</sub><sup>-1</sup>G<sub>MW</sub>(G's
Model Space)</b></p>

<p>Cameras tend to fall into two basic categories with respect to
the source of their transforms; direct application-controlled
cameras and animated scene graph-based cameras. The content
creation tools have the ability to export cameras that are
located in the scene graph itself. These are most frequently
animated via keyframes that are exported along with the scene
graph. These cameras are updated simply by ensuring that the
scene graph is up to date. The animated transforms applied to the
camera and its parent hierarchy will position and aim the camera
as desired by the artist.</p>

<p>Application-driven cameras are updated manually by the
application, most frequently changing the transforms according to
user input. Most of the Gamebryo samples include at least one
application-driven camera. In the case of an application-driven
camera, it is common for the camera to sit in world space (i.e.
have no parent). The local transform of the camera defines the
world transform of the camera in this case. Also, since the
camera in this case is not a child of the scene graph, the
application must call <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span>
upon the camera object directly every time the camera's
transforms are changed.</p>

<p>In either case, it is the responsibility of the application to
ensure that each active camera has been updated correctly prior
to culling and rendering each frame, either by calling update
directly on the camera itself, or by ensuring that the section of
the main scene graph containing the camera has been updated.</p>

<h2>Setting the View to the Renderer</h2>

<p>Both culling and rendering require the camera view
information. In the case of culling, the camera is passed
directly to the culling process object when it is invoked. In the
case of rendering, the renderer must be informed of the correct
view prior to rendering any geometry. This is accomplished via a
pair of functions, both of which are called <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderer::SetCameraData</span>. One of the
versions of <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetCameraData</span>
simply takes a camera pointer as its argument, while the other
takes the view data explicitly. These two functions accomplish
the same task, but allow applications to pass down view
information with or without an actual camera object. These
functions can only be called when the renderer is capable of
rendering geometry, but they may be called as many times as is
desired within a single frame or rendering pass. Applications
should call this function at least once after opening a rendering
target and before rendering 3D geometry.</p>

<p>An additional function <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetScreenSpaceCameraData</span>, is used only for
screen-space rendering, and is described in the section <a href=
"Screen_Space_Rendering.htm">Screen Space Rendering</a>.</p>
