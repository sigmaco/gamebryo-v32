<h1>Performance Impacts of Transparent Thread Safety</h1>

<p>As stated in the previous section of this document, 
 Gamebryo is not transparently thread safe. Simply put, a developer cannot 
 just multithread an application and expect safe behavior in all circumstances. 
 To understand this, let's look at concurrency and reentrancy issues that 
 could occur in <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObjectNET::IncRefCount</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObjectNET::DecRefCount</span>. These functions 
 are called whenever a smart pointer assignment occurs which over the course 
 of an application amounts to a significant number of times.</p>

<h2>Concurrency Issues</h2>

<p>Assume that we have an object created and assigned to 
 a regular pointer. This object has a smart pointer reference count of 
 zero at this point. We create two threads and pass a pointer reference 
 to that object into each thread. If we have two processors in the machine 
 running this code, it is possible that both of these threads will occur 
 concurrently. Each thread loads the cache line with the object's reference 
 count and increments it. Then they write that cache line back. If these 
 operations occur concurrently, then both threads will read in a value 
 of zero and write out a value of one. This behavior is incorrect since 
 there are two smart pointer references to the object. If each thread releases 
 its smart pointer, then the object will be deleted twice which will cause 
 a crash.</p>

<p>We can solve this problem by making sure that the read 
 and increment operations occur atomically by using a critical section 
 or some thinner form of thread synchronization. In this case, only one 
 thread would be allowed to touch the reference count for that object at 
 any one time. This type of behavior is implemented for reference counted 
 objects on all platforms.</p>

<h2>Reentrancy Issues</h2>

<p>Again assume that we have the same situation with a 
 single object and two background threads running on a single processor 
 machine. It is not possible for both threads to be running simultaneously, 
 but it is possible for them to share time. Assume that the first thread 
 enters <span class="NDLSystemFont">IncRefCount</span> and is interrupted 
 before the reference count is actually incremented; The reference count 
 is still zero. Now assume that the second thread assigns the pointer and 
 releases the pointer before the first thread gets the processor back again. 
 The reference count will go to one and then back to zero. The object will 
 be deleted. When control returns to our first thread, it will increment 
 freed memory and continue about execution with a resource that has already 
 been freed. </p>

<p>Again, this problem can be solved to a degree by making 
 the read and increment operations atomic. However, there is also a race 
 condition here where the increment depends upon how fast the other thread 
 deletes the object. These types of races occur when an application passes 
 references to an object as both regular and smart pointers. Applications 
 should be careful when referencing an object with both regular and smart 
 pointers.</p>

<h2>Performance Analysis</h2>

<p>While the issues outlined above are certainly pedagogical 
 cases and demonstrate very poor programming assumptions, they do show 
 problems that could potentially happen if an application accesses data 
 across threads without restriction. This problem could be resolved by 
 providing a critical section or other mutual exclusion object for each 
 such method or object. This approach, however, has implications on performance 
 since such a synchronization primitive would have to be touched for every 
 call to these functions. In the case of <span class="NDLSystemFont">IncRefCount</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">DecRefCount</span>, this would result in 
 thousands of calls per frame. There are lighter weight synchronization 
 functions for incrementing and decrementing integer values atomically. 
 These functions are used to make several functions of Gamebryo thread-safe.</p>

<p>An alternative approach would provide each class with 
 the ability to synchronize its own methods across all instances of that 
 class. While a per-class solution allowing each class to synchronize across 
 its instances would achieve greater performance, it would still be a stiff 
 penalty like a per function solution. This per-class solution is used 
 for some cases in Gamebryo like the creation of renderer data for source 
 textures or the cleaning of stream resources.</p>

<a name=Priority_Inversion></a><h2>Priority Inversion</h2>

<p>In addition to any runtime performance implications, 
 any thread safety scheme should make sure that priority inversion does 
 not occur. Priority inversion is the situation where a high priority thread 
 is prevented from executing because it requires a locked resource held 
 by a background thread. For example, assume that an application has a 
 high priority, foreground thread running the real time events like input, 
 rendering, and scene update. In a lower priority, background thread, future 
 levels are prepared for when the user reaches that section. Also assume 
 that there is a shared pool of textures that must be accessed in a thread 
 safe way by locking a global critical section. During level update the 
 background thread may lock that critical section to access the texture 
 pool. If the high priority foreground thread must also lock that resource 
 to render with that texture pool, it may encounter a situation where it 
 cannot continue because the background thread has locked the critical 
 section resource. Thus, the lower priority thread actually gets priority 
 execution while the visual display to the user could appear unresponsive. 
 This event is priority inversion. There are synchronization primitives 
 in Gamebryo that can cause priority inversion if used incorrectly. In 
 the core engine, background execution time in these primitives is minimized 
 to avoid priority inversion as much as possible.</p>

<p>Note that in a two thread system priority inversion 
 is a minimal concern since the background thread will immediately get 
 to execute and free its resource when an inversion occurs. In heavily 
 multithreaded applications, inversion can be more serious and the foreground 
 thread could be starved for resources.</p>
