<h1>Cameras</h1>

<p>Gamebryo employs two types of projection models for cameras: a general
perspective camera model and an orthogonal projection model.</p>

<h2>General Camera Model</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span> provides a general camera model
for an application. The mathematical model is described in detail in
<span class="NDLDocTitle">Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice</span>,
2nd edition, J. D. Foley, A. van Dam, S. Feiner, and J. F. Hughes,
Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading, MA, 1992. The region of space
viewed by the camera is called the view frustum and is part of a pyramid whose
vertex is the camera location and whose base is a rectangle in the view
plane.</p>

<p>The following figure illustrates the general camera model.</p>

<div class="NDLFigureContainer">
    <img src="images/PerspectiveCamera.gif" width="479" height="409" alt=
    "PerspectiveCamera (12K)">

    <p class="NDLFigureCaption">General perspective camera model</p>
</div>

<p>In practical terms, the view:</p>

<ul>
    <li>is centered at the camera's model-space origin.</li>

    <li>looks along the direction of the positive X axis of the camera.</li>

    <li>has the camera's positive Y axis as the vertical direction on the
    screen.</li>

    <li>has the camera's positive Z axis as the right direction on the
    screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>The camera location is equal to the model-space origin of the camera. The
view plane is specified by a <em>view plane reference</em> point L<sub>V</sub>
and an associated coordinate system whose axes are the <em>view normal
vector</em> N<sub>V</sub>, the <em>view up vector</em> U<sub>V</sub>, and the
<em>view right vector</em> R<sub>V</sub>. The view plane reference point
L<sub>V</sub>= &lt;1,0,0&gt; is in model-space coordinates, as are the view
plane normal vector N<sub>V</sub>= &lt;-1,0,0&gt;, the view plane up vector
U<sub>V</sub>= &lt;0,1,0&gt;, and the view plane right vector R<sub>V</sub>=
&lt;0,0,1&gt;.</p>

<p>A camera is transformed like any other <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a></span>-derived object.
If it is not part of the scene graph, a camera requires <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> to be called so that the world information is
properly updated. The location, direction vector, up vector, and right vector
in world coordinates are readable through <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetWorldLocation</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetWorldDirection</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetWorldUpVector</span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetWorldRightVector</span>, respectively. To retain internal
consistency, an application is not permitted to set these world quantities;
they can only be changed by transforming the camera.</p>

<p>The view frustum itself is determined by six values: left <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">vl</span>, right <span class="NDLSystemFont">vr</span>, top
<span class="NDLSystemFont">vt</span>, bottom <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">vb</span>, near <span class="NDLSystemFont">vn</span>, and far
<span class="NDLSystemFont">vf</span>. All of these values are specified in the
model space of the camera. Four of these values (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">[0,0]</span>. control the field of view of the camera. Together
they are known as the <em>view rectangle</em>. The four edges of the view
rectangle (in camera model space) are determined by the vectors <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">&lt;1,0,vl&gt;</span> (left edge), <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">&lt;1,0,vr&gt;</span> (right edge), <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">&lt;1,vb,0&gt;</span> (bottom edge), and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">&lt;1,vt,0&gt;</span> (top edge). The final two values
(<span class="NDLSystemFont">vf</span>,<span class="NDLSystemFont">vn</span>)
define the near and far distances along the camera's
model-space x-axis&mdash;these should bound the desired scene. In general,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">vf</span> should be as small as possible, and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">vn</span> should be as large as possible, in order
to minimize the depth that must be fit into the limited resolution of the
Z-buffer.</p>

<p>The camera model is general in the sense that the view pyramid can be
skewed. This can be accomplished by creating a view rectangle that is not
centered at <span class="NDLSystemFont">[0,0]</span>. Regardless of the skew,
the near and far planes are parallel to the view plane. The view frustum values
<span class="NDLSystemFont">vl</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">vr</span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">vt</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">vb</span>,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">vn</span>, and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">vf</span> are set through <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetViewFrustum</span>.</p>

<p>Having defined the 3D configuration of the view frustum, the application can
also specify the rectangular portion of the rendering backbuffer to which the
view rectangle is drawn (a purely 2D mapping). These values are called <em>port
settings</em> and specify the port left <span class="NDLSystemFont">pl</span>,
right <span class="NDLSystemFont">pr</span>, top <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">pt</span>, and bottom <span class="NDLSystemFont">pb</span>.
All port settings must be in the unit interval <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">[0,1]</span>. The port for the full rendering backbuffer
corresponds to <span class="NDLSystemFont">pl=0</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">pr=1</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">pb=0</span>, and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">pt=1</span>.</p>

<p>The overall projection matrix maps from world space to view space (which
does not include the mapping from the viewport into the space of the
framebuffer ). It is the concatenation of two transforms: the rigid
world-to-model transform for the camera (i.e. the inverse of the camera's world
transform) and the projection matrix (which is defined purely by the view
frustum). This is a 4x4 matrix (it is a homogeneous transform), and can be
retrieved from the function <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCamera::GetWorldToCameraMatrix()</span>.</p>

<h2>Ortho Projection Camera Model</h2>

<p>The ortho projection camera model differs from that of the general
perspective camera model, primarily in the construction of the view-to-screen
projection matrix and the view frustum itself from the frustum values. Ortho
projection view frustums are created with the same six values that the general
perspective camera model employs. However, the planes created from these values
do not pass through a single, shared center of projection. Instead, the left,
right, top and bottom planes are all perpendicular to the view plane (note that
this means that oblique parallel projections are not supported). Additionally,
the pair <span class="NDLSystemFont">vl</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">vr</span> specify view planes which are always parallel to each
other (but reversed from one another), as do the pair <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">vt</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">vb</span>.</p>

<p>Ortho projections (sometimes referred to as parallel projections) are often
used in modeling tools for displaying side, front, top renderings and other
situations where perspective rendering is not appropriate.</p>

<p>The following figure illustrates the ortho projection camera model:</p>
