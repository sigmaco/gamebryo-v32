<h1>Gamebryo Update Slowdowns</h1>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> function 
 in Gamebryo performs a variety of tasks and is often a source of slowdown 
 for developers. Understanding what <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> 
 does can help you optimize around some of the more expensive operations. 
 This document outlines some of the things you can do to speed up <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span>.</p>

<h2>What does Update do?</h2>

<p>At its core, <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> 
 prepares the scene graph for rendering. However, <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> 
 performs several operations during this process such as updating the transforms 
 on <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a></span> 
 based classes, updating <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTimeController.htm">NiTimeController</a></span> 
 objects and updating the bounds on objects. Because of this, <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> 
 can become a very expensive function call and should be used only where 
 necessary. Listed below are several ways to optimize calls to <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span>.</p>

<h3>Don't Call Update</h3>

<p>It doesn't make much sense at first, but the fastest 
 way to speed up a call to <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> is not 
 to call it. <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> handles changes to 
 transforms, bounds, and time controllers. If some subsection of your scene 
 graph never has any of these changes, consider updating it separately 
 from the dynamic portion of your scene graph. In general, this means that 
 scenery in a game that never moves and has no animations can be updated 
 once and rendered every frame from a new camera angle. Separate your scene 
 graph into static and dynamic components. Update the static component 
 once and update the dynamic component as needed.</p>

<h3>Use UpdateSelected</h3>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="UpdateSelected_Overview.htm">UpdateSelected</a></span> 
 is a variant on <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> that tries to 
 avoid expensive calculations when they are unnecessary. For example, <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="UpdateSelected_Overview.htm">UpdateSelected</a></span> 
 may skip the work of updating transforms if there are no <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTimeController.htm">NiTimeController</a></span> 
 objects attached that could change the transform. Assets exported from 
 the art plugins should already be configured for use with <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="UpdateSelected_Overview.htm">UpdateSelected</a></span>. 
 In general, using <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="UpdateSelected_Overview.htm">UpdateSelected</a></span> 
 will give some but not all of the benefits of segmenting a scene graph 
 into components and updating only the dynamic components as suggested 
 in the "Don't Call Update" section. It is also important to 
 note that if every <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a></span> 
 in a hierarchy is animated such as a character with skeletal animation, 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="UpdateSelected_Overview.htm">UpdateSelected</a></span> 
 can sometimes actually be more expensive than Update since it must perform 
 branching operations based off of the data for each object.</p>

<h3>Simplify the Scene Graph Hierarchy</h3>

<p>Every node inserted into the scene graph costs some 
 CPU time to update. Removing unnecessary nodes can increase the speed 
 of <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> operations. By default, the 
 <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Scene_Graph_Optimization.htm">optimization 
 plugin</a> tries to do this coming out of the art packages. If there are 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiNode.htm">NiNode</a></span> 
 objects in a scene graph that only serve to hold a name and a single child, 
 they can easily be removed by pushing the name and the transform down 
 to that child.</p>

<h3>Use Linear Animation Keys</h3>

<p>There are several types of animation keys in the Gamebryo 
 animation system, but linear keys are the simplest to interpolate between 
 and take the least amount of CPU time. If possible, consider exporting 
 art with linear keys to increase performance. </p>

<h3>Use Fewer Bones</h3>

<p>Characters with skeletal animation often represent the 
 most expensive portion of a scene graph because each <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiNode.htm">NiNode</a></span> 
 represents a bone that has to be animated and then updated correctly. 
 Consider reducing the number of bones in a character either permanently 
 in the art package or dynamically using the Bone LOD system. The Bone 
 LOD system allows you to turn off animation of subtrees which will decrease 
 the amount of time needed in Update. Bone LOD is further discussed in 
 the NiAnimation documents for <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSkinningLODController.htm">NiSkinningLODController</a></span> 
 and documents for the <a href="../../Art/Max/BoneLOD.htm">3ds 
 max</a> and <a href="../../Art/Maya/Bone_LOD_.htm">Maya</a> 
 plugins. </p>
