<h1>Gamebryo Rendering Slowdowns</h1>

<p>In our code sample in the <a href="Profiling_Consistent_Slowdown.htm">previous 
 sections</a>, we rendered the scene by calling the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication::RenderFrame</span> 
 function. Culling and rendering a scene involves recursing through a scene 
 graph performing hierarchical frustum culling and calling <span class="NDLSystemFont">RenderImmediate</span> 
 on geometry objects that are not culled. While your application may use 
 a more complex method of rendering than just calling <span class="NDLSystemFont">RenderFrame</span>, 
 it is quite possible that your performance bottlenecks are occurring during 
 the rendering process. Speeding up the rendering process can be a difficult 
 task, but there are a few techniques that can help. In general, the goal 
 of these techniques is to reduce the number of renderable objects without 
 reducing the visual complexity of the scene. On some platforms, particularly 
 PC, the overhead of submitting an object for rendering can be quite significant. 
 Reducing the number of renderable objects can vastly increase the performance 
 of an application. </p>

<h2>Merge Similar Objects</h2>

<p>Merging objects in the scene graph that share the same 
 properties and effects into a single geometry object can reduce the object 
 overhead of a scene without reducing the amount of geometry seen by the 
 user. The <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Scene_Graph_Optimization.htm">optimization 
 plugin</a> performs this operation out of the art packages, but you can 
 help by grouping static objects with the same properties and effects under 
 the same node. If the "Merge Sibling NiMesh objects" option 
 is enabled, these objects can be merged into one. Applications can also 
 stitch objects together in code. For assistance with this process, visit Emergent's <a href="https://pulse.emergent.net/support/" target="_blank">Online Support Portal</a>.</p>

<h2>Reduce the Number of Bones on Characters</h2>

<p>As stated before, characters with skeletal animation 
 are often the most expensive objects in a game. Reducing the number of 
 bones in art of by using Bone LOD has been discussed in "Gamebryo 
 Update Slowdowns" <a href="Gamebryo_Update_Slowdowns.htm">section</a>. 
 These optimizations also have impacts on rendering of characters as well. 
 On platforms that use software skinning, reducing the number of bones 
 will have some impact on the vertex deformation calculations due to increased 
 cache coherency and fewer bone influences per vertex. On platforms that 
 use hardware skinning, reducing the number of bones will allow Gamebryo 
 to decrease the number of partitions that must be set for each skinned 
 character. Since each partition is treated as a distinct renderable object, 
 fewer partitions leads to fewer renderable objects which is one of the 
 primary goals of optimizing our scenes.</p>

<h2>Push Work to the GPU</h2>

<p>In modern graphics systems with programmable shaders, 
 work can often be moved onto the GPU to balance out the workload on the 
 CPU. The most common method for this is to use a vertex shader that handles 
 skinning with a larger palette of bones than traditional hardware skinning. 
 This results in fewer partitions and hence fewer renderable objects.</p>
