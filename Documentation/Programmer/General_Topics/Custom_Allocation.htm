<h1>efd::MemManager and efd::MemTracker</h1>

<p>Gamebryo is designed to be a "black box" with respect to memory management.
All allocations and deallocations must flow through a common chokepoint.
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__MemManager.htm">efd::MemManager</a></span> is the
class that contains this common chokepoint. This class along with all other
memory management is provided in the Foundation subsystem. Throughout the Core
Runtime subsystem 'Ni' prefixed memory management classes and macros exist for
backward compatibility, but they are simply <a href=
"../../Convert/Announce/Foundation_Bridge_Layer.htm">bridged</a> to their
counterparts in the Foundation subsystem.</p>

<p>The memory manager is composed of a single allocator object. This allocator
object is responsible for all allocations within Gamebryo. In memory tracking
builds, a custom allocator, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__MemTracker.htm">efd::MemTracker</a></span> wraps
access to a child allocator. It will then provide memory tracking and debugging
functionality transparently to the end user.</p>

<p>In all builds, all memory requests are forwarded by default to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__StandardAllocator.htm">efd::StandardAllocator</a>.</span>
StandardAllocator is actually typedefed to a templated class called
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__SmallObjectAllocator.htm">efd::SmallObjectAllocator</a></span>
which forwards requests to the standard aligned allocation routines for the
platform. The small object allocator is based off of the design proposed by
Andrei Alexandrescu in "Modern C++ Design" wherein memory allocations of the
same size are drawn from a common "pool" of preallocated objects.</p>

<p>The memory allocator used is determined by the return value of the function
efd::CreateGlobalMemoryAllocator(). The macro EE_USE_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR can be
used to select the default allocator. The allocator must be capable of
functioning pre-main. This guarantees that all allocations will occur using the
same allocator throughout the lifetime of the Gamebryo system.</p>

<p>All Gamebryo allocation requests come from one of two sources: Gamebryo
implementations of common allocation routines <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">(<a href=
"../../Reference/Namespaces/efd.htm#build-dependent_memory_management_routines_from_memorydefines.h">
efd::_Malloc</a>, <a href=
"../../Reference/Namespaces/efd.htm#build-independent_memory_management_routines_from_memorydefines.h">
efd::_Free</a>, <a href=
"../../Reference/Namespaces/efd.htm#build-dependent_memory_management_routines_from_memorydefines.h">
efd::_Realloc</a>, <a href=
"../../Reference/Namespaces/efd.htm#build-dependent_memory_management_routines_from_memorydefines.h">
efd::_AlignedMalloc</a>, <a href=
"../../Reference/Namespaces/efd.htm#build-independent_memory_management_routines_from_memorydefines.h">
efd::_AlignedFree</a>, <a href=
"../../Reference/Namespaces/efd.htm#build-dependent_memory_management_routines_from_memorydefines.h">
efd::_AlignedRealloc</a></span>) or from <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__MemObject.htm">efd::MemObject</a></span>-derived
classes using the class overrides of new and delete. These two paths are
discussed in detail below.</p>

<h2>_Alloc, _Malloc, _Free, _Realloc, _AlignedMalloc...</h2>

<p>Gamebryo direct allocation routines are used for intrinsic types (floats,
ints, chars, etc) and types that do not need constructors or destructors. Much
like malloc, free, and realloc, these routines simply allocate the memory that
you requested. They perform no initialization of that memory. Calls to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">_Malloc</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">_Realloc</span> must be paired with calls to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">_Free</span> for deallocation to occur properly. Similarly,
calls to <span class="NDLSystemFont">_AlignedMalloc</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">_AlignedRealloc</span> must be paired with calls to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">_AlignedFree</span> for deallocation to occur
properly.</p>

<p>If an application does not use these allocation routines, the memory will
not be tracked or managed by Gamebryo. This can cause a mismatch if the memory
was allocated externally and then freed by Gamebryo routines. Please see
<a href="Memory_Management_Troubleshooting.htm">Memory Management
Troubleshooting</a> for more details on common memory management issues.</p>

<p>The macros <span class="NDLSystemFont">EE_ALLOC</span>, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">EE_MALLOC</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">EE_FREE</span>,
call internal versions of these functions. The macros allow the engine to
generate file, line, function information automatically in memory tracking
builds.</p>

<h2>efd::MemObject, EE_NEW, and EE_DELETE</h2>

<p>Objects requiring constructors and destructors in Gamebryo are allocated
using <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/Macros/efd_macros_ee_new_ee_delete.htm">EE_NEW</a></span>
and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/Macros/efd_macros_ee_new_ee_delete.htm">EE_DELETE</a></span>
and must be derived from a common base class, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">efd::MemObject</span>. These macros, like <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">EE_ALLOC</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">EE_FREE</span>,
and others listed above encapsulate the need to store the file, line, and
function information for memory tracking.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">MemObject</span> overrides the global
<span class="NDLSystemFont">new</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">delete</span> on a class level. All derived classes will
inherit these allocation overrides. Note that inheriting from <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">MemObject</span> requires no additional per-object memory
overhead. Additionally, <span class="NDLSystemFont">MemObject</span> overrides
<span class="NDLSystemFont">new[]</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">delete[]</span> on a class level. The only overhead for array
allocations is a few bytes that the compiler generates in order to call the
destructor for each element in the array. Most objects will have this data
generated automatically, so the overhead should not be a concern.</p>

<a name="MemoryTrackingAndDebugging" id="MemoryTrackingAndDebugging"></a><h2>Memory Tracking and Debugging</h2>

<p>Whether the constant <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiSystem/NiMemoryDefines.htm#Preprocessor_Definitions">EE_USE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT</a></span>
is defined determines whether memory related metrics (for memory leaks and
memory summary statistics) are tracked and whether Memory-Leaks.xml and
Memory-Overview.xml reports are created. The Memory-Leaks.xml file contains
records of all memory leaks, and the Memory-Overview.xml file contains summary
information on allocated memory and, optionally, detailed per-allocation
records of allocated memory during the lifetime of the application.</p>

<p>These XML files reference custom XSL stylesheets that are created at
application startup. This approach enables the user to simply double-click on
the XML log and display an HTML report in their current web browser. Depending
on the size of the resultant XML file, a user may wait a lengthy amount of time
for the report to be fully generated. Internet Explorer progressively loads the
XSL-generated report while Firefox and other Mozilla-based browsers only
display the page when the full computation is done. Other tools, such as XMLSpy
or Microsoft Developer Studio may be used to view the data.</p>

<p>Note that memory tracking requires the use of the __FILE__, __LINE__, and
__FUNCTION__ macros in code. Since use of these macros will bloat the
application library in builds, these macros are only used when the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiSystem/NiMemoryDefines.htm#Preprocessor_Definitions">EE_USE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT</a></span>
constant is enabled.</p>

<table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
    <tr align="left">
        <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD">
            <p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>

            <div class="NDLNote">
                By default, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
                "../../Reference/NiSystem/NiMemoryDefines.htm#Preprocessor_Definitions">
                EE_USE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT</a></span> is defined to enable memory
                tracking only for <span class="NDLSystemFont">Debug</span> and
                <span class="NDLSystemFont">Debug DLL</span> builds.
            </div>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>In addition, per-allocation memory logging is disabled by default. As a
result, sections other than "Summary" in Memory-Overview.xml are empty by
default. Per-allocation memory logging may be re-enabled (which will fill in
the empty sections in Memory-Overview.xml), but keep in mind that it has a
significant performance impact, especially on consoles.</p>

<p>To re-enable per-allocation memory logging, add the following code to your
main(), before calling NiInit:</p>
<pre>
// Enable per-allocation memory logging to Memory-Overview.xml.
if (efd::MemTracker::Get())
    efd::MemTracker::Get()-&gt;SetWriteToLog(true);
</pre>

<p>The freed memory report is generated throughout the lifetime of the
application. The logging steps will periodically append to the active XML file
on disk, so applications may notice a "hiccup" in frame rate in the event of
many allocations within a single render frame. The log is written out
periodically to save the memory tracker from needing to store all allocations
throughout the lifetime of the application. This approach significantly reduces
the memory overhead of the memory tracker, but in applications with very tight
memory budgets, a user may encounter situations where the application runs out
of memory in memory tracked builds. An application may query the memory tracker
for its current overhead in bytes if such a circumstance is a concern.</p>
