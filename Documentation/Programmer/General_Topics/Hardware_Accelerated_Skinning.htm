<h1>Hardware-Accelerated Skinning</h1>

<p>When off-loading the skinning operation to the graphics
hardware, certain care needs to be taken to format the data
properly. This document outlines these restrictions and
variations from the algorithm defined by <a href=
"Mathematics_of_Skinning.htm">The Mathematics of
Skinning</a>.</p>

<h2>Bones and Submeshes</h2>

<p>A given skinned mesh will have an array of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span> pointers whose world
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTransforms</span> uniquely define
the bones affecting the mesh. This array can be accessed using
the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSkinningMeshModifier::GetBones</span> method.
Every frame that the skinned mesh is to be rendered, the bone and
skin-to-bone transforms are multiplied together to define the
shader constants that are used in the skinning operation. The
array used to set these shader constants can be accessed using
the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSkinningMeshModifier::GetBoneMatrices</span>
method.</p>

<p>Since hardware skinning involves setting shader constants on
the hardware and the number of shader constants is limited, it is
often necessary to break a mesh up into multiple pieces known as
sub-meshes, which are influenced by a subset of the overall bone
array. By convention, each vertex can only be influenced by 4
bones, requiring four per-vertex bone indices to look up the
correct transform from the set of bone transforms associated with
the sub-mesh.</p>

<p>A mesh that needs to be hardware skinned can be broken into
sub-meshes using the Skin and Bones Hardware support option found
in the Scene Graph Optimizations plug-in (See <a href=
"../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Scene_Graph_Optimization.htm">Scene
Graph Optimization</a>.). That option will cause any mesh that
have a skinning mesh modifier applied to be partitioned for
hardware. The underlying sub-mesh generation code divides the
triangles in the skinned object into subsets of triangles that
are influenced by the same subset of no more than the number of
bones per partition specified. The number of sub-meshes that are
created to accommodate the specified value can be accessed by
calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMesh::GetSubmeshCount</span>. When viewing a
scene using the <a href=
"../../Tools/Asset_Viewer/Introduction_to_the_Asset_Viewer.htm">Asset
Viewer</a> application, this value is displayed in the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Tools/Asset_Viewer/Asset_Viewer_Property_Sheets.htm">Properties</a></span>
sheet for a skinned object with the label "Submesh Count".
Skinning performance on hardware-accelerated platforms depends
largely on making the number of sub-meshes as small as
possible.</p>

<p>When a skinned object is rendered on hardware that supports
hardware accelerated skinning, the renderer must loop over the
sub-meshes and set the active bone matrices and then render the
triangles in that sub-mesh. The per-sub-mesh overhead is
significant. Programmers and artists alike should devote
attention to reducing the number of sub-meshes in skinned
characters. Several methods are available to reduce the sub-mesh
count.</p>

<p>In general, the more influence each bone has on a model's
vertices, the more sub-meshes that will have to be created.
Reducing each bone's region of influence will generally reduce
the number of sub-meshes. Another effective way to reduce the
number of sub-meshes is to increase the skin threshold value.
This value indicates a threshold value below which it is safe to
ignore a bone's influence on a vertex. This value should be
increased to as large a value as is possible without creating
unacceptable rigidity in the skinned model. (MAX users, see
<a href=
"../../Art/Max/Gamebryo_3ds_max_Export_Options1.htm">Gamebryo 3ds
max Export Options</a>. Maya users, see <a href=
"../../Art/Maya/Export_Animation_Options.htm">Export Animation
Options</a>.)</p>

<p>The most effective way to reduce the number of sub-meshes and
increase skinning performance on the Win32 platform is to write a
custom palette-skinning vertex shader that allows the bones per
submesh value to be set to a value greater than or equal to the
total number of bones in the model. The value used by the
Gamebryo plug-ins can be accessed by changing the number labeled
"Bones Per Partition" in the "Optimization Options" dialog box.
(See <a href=
"../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Scene_Graph_Optimization.htm">Scene
Graph Optimization</a>.) The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Art/Other/ASMSkinning.htm">ASMSkinning</a></span> shader
demonstrates the use of a vertex shader in skinning..</p>

<p>Note that for the windows fixed-function legacy pipeline, the
number of bones per sub-mesh cannot exceed 4.</p><a name=

<p>Note: <span class="NDLSystemFont">F_NORMUINT8_4_BGRA</span>

that don't support <span class="NDLSystemFont">F_UINT8_4</span>.
However, even on these cards, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">F_UINT8_4</span> can be used as the format for
blend indices and can be converted at run-time for FX and FXL
shaders via the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">BlendIndicesAsD3DColor</span> annotation and for
NSF shaders via requesting blend indices in the packing
definition as <span class="NDLSystemFont">PDT_UByteColor</span>.
Therefore, to have a mesh that is compatible across all
platforms, use the <span class="NDLSystemFont">F_UINT8_4</span>
format for blend indices.</p><a name="Runtime_Evaluation" id=

<h2>Runtime Evaluation</h2>

<p>The following UML sequence diagram outlines the execution path
of hardware skinning.</p>

<div class="NDLFigureContainer">
    <img src="images/GPUSkinning.jpg" width="939" height="642"
    alt="GPUSkinning (59K)"> 
    <!-- <p class="NDLFigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
</div>

<p>As seen in the diagram above, there is just one mesh modifier
operation that occurs in hardware skinning, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiCalculateBoneMatricesKernel.htm">CalculateBoneMatrices</a></span>.
This operation is represented as an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiFloodgate</span> kernel that must be submitted
at the appropriate time in the application main loop.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CalculateBoneMatrices</span>
kernel gathers all of the world-space <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTransform.htm">NiTransforms</a></span>
from the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObjects</span> that make
up the bone hierarchy, multiplies them by the root bone to skin
transform and the inverse of the bone's world-space transforms at
bind time, resulting in an output array of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMatrix3x4.htm">NiMatrix3x4</a></span>
transforms. Since the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span>
being skinned may occur before or after the bones in the
hierarchy that affect it, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CalculateBoneMatrices</span> kernel cannot be
executed until the end of the Update loop for the scene graph
containing both the mesh and the bone hierarchy. This is
indicated in the above diagram by the call to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FlushTaskGroups</span> on the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager</span>. This call will submit
the workflows containing any <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSyncArgs::SYNC_POST_UPDATE</span> kernels like
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CalculateBoneMatrices</span> for
execution. The kernel will be processed by <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiFloodgate</span> in a separate thread as
additional CPU's or SPU's are available to do work. The
application must wait for the bone matrices to submit them as
shader constants before rendering as indicated by the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshModifier.htm">CompleteTasks</a></span>
(with <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSyncArgs::SYNC_RENDER</span>)
