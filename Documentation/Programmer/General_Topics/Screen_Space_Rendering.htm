<h1>Screen Space Rendering</h1>

<p>3D applications rarely consist of nothing but full, 3D worlds. Most 3D applications also include
some set of 2D or screen-space objects, often used for user interface items, heads-up displays and
backdrops. Gamebryo supports these types of objects, and includes a geometric classes to allow for
different kinds of screen-space rendering. Note that like any other form of geometry in Gamebryo,
all screen-space rendering must be drawn to a fully-prepared renderer (open render target group,
etc). See <a href="Rendering_a_Frame.htm">Rendering a Frame</a> for details of these requirements.
The section below describes the screen-space class supported by Gamebryo, as well as any additional
requirements that must be met prior to rendering instances of it.</p>

<h2>Rendering Individual Objects</h2>

<h3>"2.5D" Rendering: NiMeshScreenElements</h3>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> represent the
screen-space equivalent of generic <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span> objects - they support general triangle lists
(including the ability to add and delete sets of triangle and vertices within a given <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> instance),
shaders, render state, and lighting. They also support dynamic transforms (and even transform
hierarchies), as they are a subclass of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span> and hence <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> objects use the
full geometric pipeline, and require the use of a special 3D view prior to rendering into a render
target group. Prior to rendering <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span>, the code that
renders them must call <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderer.htm">NiRenderer</a>::SetScreenSpaceCameraData</span>, which sets
the view to a normalized (0.0 - 1.0) coordinate system. Once the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SetScreenSpaceCameraData</span> call is made, any number of calls to render
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> objects may be
made. If the application needs to render additional 3D items once the 2D rendering is done, the
desired 3D camera's view must be reset via a call to <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderer.htm">NiRenderer</a>::SetCameraData</span>.</p>

<p>In this screen-space coordinate system, the upper-left-hand corner of the screen is the origin,
the positive X axis is towards the right, the positive Y axis is down, and the positive Z axis is
into the screen. Note that while this is a right-handed coordinate system in 3D, when viewed as a
purely 2D on-screen coordinate system, X and Y form a left-handed pair. Thus, assuming the default
Gamebryo rendering system of front-CCW, visible polygons on screen in this view would appear to be
clockwise if one used the more common interpretation of X=right, Y=up (right-handed) coordinate
system. The creator of these objects must take this into account when creating custom polygons. The
built-in rectangle creation functions take this into account and create the rectangles in the
following vertex order: left-top (min X, min Y), left-bottom(min X, max Y), right-bottom (max X,
max Y), right-top (max X, min Y). This is counter-clockwise when viewed in the X= right, Y=down
coordinate system.</p>

<p>Depth is less frequently used, but can be set in the vertex data contained in <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMeshScreenElements</span></a> objects. Z values render front to back from values
of 0 to 9999.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows the coordinate system - note that the screen-space coordinate system is
relative to the <em>port</em>, not the buffer.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> are used for all
screen-space rendering. <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> allows for
complex rendering effects, and can also support any type of texture mapping. Applications that wish
to use a single splash screen for multiple resolutions, for example, must use <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> for that splash
screen, so that the texture can be stretched or squashed in order to fit any non-native
resolutions. Rectangles are still very popular shapes with <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span>, so the object
includes functions to easily set a 4-vertex polygon within a screen elements object to a
screen-aligned and/or texture-aligned rectangle.</p>

<p>The fact that <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> can support
shaders make them a common object when implementing full-screen shading effects. In such a
situation, the entire scene is rendered to an off-screen texture. Then, the resulting texture is
rendered to a single screen elements object containing a single rectangle that fills the screen,
using a pixel shader. Examples of this may be found in numerous Gamebryo demos.</p>

<h3>Pixel-to-texel Mapping</h3>

<p>It is often useful to be able to map a texture onto a screen-space rectangle in such a way that
the texels of the texture and the pixels of the destination buffer match exactly one-to-one (or
exactly 2-to-1, etc). In fact, for some shader effects such as downsizing a rendered texture to
half its size, exact pixel-to-texel mapping is a requirement to make the effect work correctly.</p>

<p>When rendering an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> object, the
screen-space camera settings for the given rendering target are used. These camera settings define
(0.0, 0.0) as the upper-left corner of the upper-left pixel in the port and (1.0,1.0) as the
lower-right corner of the lower-right pixel in the port. Since texture coordinates of 0.0 and 1.0
define a point halfway between the last texel of one repetition of a texture and the first pixel of
the next repetition of that texture, then the screen values used in Gamebryo match the method used
by texture mapping. The simplest example of this is mapping an M-by-N texel texture directly to an
M-by-N pixel render target group. The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> rectangle for
this is simply:</p>
<pre>
NiMeshScreenElementsPtr spSE = NiNew NiMeshScreenElements(false, false, 1);
  int iHandle = spSE-&gt;Insert(4);
  spSE-&gt;SetRectangle(iHandle, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
  spSE-&gt;SetTextures(iHandle, 0, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f); 
</pre>

<p>Note that nothing in the above code uses the resolutions of the textures explicitly. This same
screen-space item will work in any situation in which the texture and rendering target are the same
resolution. The diagram below shows the case of a 1x4 texel texture being rendered into a 1x4 pixel
rendering target directly. In this diagram, pixel boundaries are represented by the rectangle edges
and exact pixel/texel centers (the sample point for non-antialiased rendering) are represented by
dots:</p>

<div class="NDLFigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/PixelToTexelExact.gif" width="545" height="400"> 
    <!-- <p class="NDLFigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
</div>

<p>In fact, this same object can also be used to stretch an entire texture across an entire
rendering target, no matter what the resolution of either. However, note that if the resolutions do
not match, the mapping will obviously not be pixel-to-texel. This can be used to an application's
advantage. For example, using the above <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> object to render
an M-by-N texture into an M/2-by-N/2 rendering target with bilinear texture filtering will result
in the rendering target computing a box-filtered version of the source texture - in effect, a
hardware-computed mipmap level. Repeating this process over and over, rendering an
M/2<sup>i</sup>-by-N/2<sup>i</sup> to an M/2<sup>i+1</sup>-by-N/2<sup>i+1</sup> rendering target
can compute an entire mipmap pyramid for a rendered texture dynamically in hardware. This is
because the pixel centers of the lower-resolution rendering target will fall exactly in the middle
between pairs of texel centers of the higher-resolution source texture. The diagram below shows the
case of a 4x1 texel texture being rendered into a 2x1 pixel rendering target using bilerp. Once
again, pixel boundaries are represented by the rectangle edges and exact pixel/texel centers (the
sample point for non-antialiased rendering) are represented by dots:</p>

<div class="NDLFigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/PixelToTexelDownsizing.gif" width="526" height="400"> 
    <!-- <p class="NDLFigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
</div>

<h2>Management of Screen Space Rendering Objects</h2>

<p>The core Gamebryo libraries do not provide specific high-level management structures for the
screen-space rendering objects since they are a subclass of NiMesh. These items can basically stand
on their own when rendering , so little more than an array or list of these items are required to
manage the objects to be rendered. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span> does include an
array of this type of object, which are automatically rendered by the default <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RenderScreenItems</span>, which is in turn called by <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RenderFrame</span>. Thus, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span>-based
apps that simply use screen space items as overlays can attach their screen space items to the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span> member container obtained via <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiApplication::GetScreenElements</span>, and they will be rendered each frame. More
advanced applications can create their own containers, or can even render the objects as needed
directly. Since the screen-space objects can support complex rendered items (such as an entire page
of rendered text), applications can often create complex effects with even a single object, making
large arrays of these items unnecessary.</p>

<h2>The Architecture of NiMeshScreenElements</h2>

<h3>NiMeshScreenElements and Component "Polygons"</h3>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> is a flexible
class that is designed to support a wide range of screen-space primitives. The class manages any
number of atomic "polygons", which are each very much like individual triangle list primitives
(i.e. similar to <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span> objects, although the implementation is
actually to represent all of the "polygons" in a given <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> object with a
single <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span>
object). Each polygon in an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> object has its
own array of vertices (and colors, normals, and texture coordinate sets, if desired), and its own
set of triangle connectivity data. Each polygon object is self-contained; a polygon object can only
access its own vertices, not the vertices for any other polygon object in the same <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> instance.</p>

<h3>Polygon Objects and their Vertices</h3>

<p>Polygon objects within an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> instance are
uniquely identified by integer "handles". Within a given polygon object, the vertex array (and
other per-vertex arrays) may be retrieved and individual vertices in that array accessed via an
index. Thus, each vertex in the entire <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> instance is
represented by a unique pair of indices; (polygon index, vertex index). The vertex indices within
each polygon range from 0 to the number of vertices in that polygon minus one.</p>

<h3>Polygon Objects and their Triangles</h3>

<p>Triangle arrays are also stored and indexed per polygon. The number of valid indices for a given
polygon object is equal to the number of triangles in that polygon object, times three. The fully
general set of indices per polygon object means that each polygon object can represent a convex,
concave, simple or complex polygon in the formal sense, or even a set of disjoint polygons or
polyhedra. The main idea is that a polygon object represents an atomic subset of the triangles in
an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> object. Polygon
objects within an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> instance may be
inserted or deleted at will. However, individual vertices and triangles within a polygon object may
not be added or deleted. In order to change the number of vertices or triangles in a polygon
object, the polygon object must be deleted and recreated.</p>

<h3>The Coordinate System</h3>

<p>The vertex positions are stored in normalized coordinates, and thus require no changes if the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> object is
rendered to multiple render target groups of different sizes. However, note that the aspect ratio
of the render target is not taken into account when rendering <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span>. If the content
is authored for a 4:3 aspect ratio rendering target and then rendered to a square rendering target,
then there may be squashing or stretching as the object is rendered to exactly fit the target.</p>

<h3>Modifying Vertices and Triangles in a Polygon</h3>

<p>The accessor functions within <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshScreenElements.htm">NiMeshScreenElements</a></span> are designed to
allow two types of vertex component access. The first is enabled by the "Set" functions, and copies
data into the internal representation from single values or arrays of values. These functions also
automatically set the "changed" flags upon the data, ensuring that the renderer will repack the
data prior to rendering the object again. The other type of access is to use the array-returning
Get functions (not the Get functions that take arrays as arguments these functions copy data into
user-supplied arrays), which return pointers to the internal representation of the data.</p>
