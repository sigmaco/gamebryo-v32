<h1>Object Sorting</h1>

<h2>Sorted Rendering with Accumulators</h2>

<p>While it is possible to render sets of visible objects as
stored in <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiVisibleArray.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span></a> objects directly by
looping over their contents and calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderObject.htm">NiRenderObject</a>::RenderImmediate</span>,
the more common case of low-level rendering is to use an <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> as the rendering proxy.
This form of rendering is referred to as "sorted" rendering. As
we shall see, sorted rendering can accomplish far more than pure
sorting. While depth buffers have made the back-to-front sorting
of opaque objects unnecessary, depth sorting of a subset of the
scene (e.g. translucent objects) is often useful. In addition,
<a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> objects allow for
last-minute modification of objects prior to rendering, allowing
for powerful rendering tricks (which are often used in Gamebryo
sample applications).</p>

<p>Sorted rendering via <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> is quite simple.
High-level rendering code simply "registers" objects that it
wants to render with an <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a>, and the accumulator
object takes care of sorting, preprocessing (as desired) and
rendering the registered objects. In fact, Gamebryo rendering
convenience functions (e.g. <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDrawSceneUtility.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawScene</span></a>) and systems (e.g.
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiApplication/Introduction_to_NiApplication.htm">
NiApplication</a>::RenderFrame</span>) are capable of using
<a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> objects
transparently.</p>

<p>Note that the Gamebryo sorting system
explicitly supports object-level sorting only polygons within a
single object will not be sorted with respect to each other, nor
will polygons within multiple objects be sorted with respect to
each other.</p>

<p>Gamebryo's culling system generates visible
arrays that are filled with visible objects in scene graph order,
which is almost never a depth-sorted order. It is also a
relatively static ordering, since scene graph structure does not
tend to change every frame. Thus, if a particular dynamic
ordering is required of rendering, the output of the culling
process itself is rarely usable directly. Sorting allows for any
desired dynamic ordering to be affected upon the objects at the
time of rendering.</p>

<h2>Accumulator Functions</h2>

<p>The basic interface that defines an <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> and any concrete
subclass thereof includes three important functions. All of these
are of immediate interest to both users of the system and authors
of accumulators. They are listed in the order that they are
called during a rendering operation by the application or engine
helper function.</p>

<h3>StartAccumulating</h3>

<p>This function resets the accumulator to be
empty, caches camera data for the current view (since many
accumulators do view-space operations such as depth sorting) and
prepares the accumulator to receive renderable objects. This
function must be called prior to registering any objects via
calls to <span class="NDLSystemFont">RegisterObjectArray</span>,
and every call to this function must be paired to a later call to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">FinishAccumulating</span>.</p>

<h3>RegisterObjectArray</h3>

<p>This function is the renderable-consuming
interface for all accumulators. Applications rendering using an
accumulator should pass all objects to be rendered to this
function. In this way, this function replaces the basic
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderObject.htm">NiRenderObject</a>::RenderImmediate</span>
rendering loop described in the doc section <a href=
"Rendering_Meshes.htm">Rendering Meshes</a>. Applications can
assume that the objects in the array will be rendered as
appropriate by the accumulator. "As appropriate" is a key phrase
here; there may be functional differences between basic rendering
and rendering with an accumulator (which is the point of using
accumulators in the first place).</p>

<p>An accumulator may render any or all of the
objects registered during a call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RegisterObjectArray</span> immediately, may defer
the rendering of some objects until the call to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FinishAccumulating</span>, or may ignore some of
the objects entirely. For example, the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAlphaAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAlphaAccumulator</span></a> (detailed below)
renders opaque objects immediately during this call, while
registering the alpha blended objects for later rendering in
<span class="NDLSystemFont">FinishAccumulating</span>.</p>

<p>Since this function often results in the
immediate rendering of geometry, all of the prerequisites that
apply to immediate geometry rendering apply to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RegisterObjectArray</span> as well. See <a href=
"Rendering_a_Frame.htm">Rendering a Frame</a> for details of
these prerequisites. Since an accumulator may defer rendering of
any given object or may skip rendering an object entirely, the
application cannot assume that all geometry sent to a call to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">RegisterObjectArray</span> has been
rendered when the function returns.</p>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RegisterObjectArray</span> must only be called
between a matched pair of calls to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">StartAccumulating</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FinishAccumulating</span>. Behavior of calls to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">RegisterObjectArray</span> outside of
a <span class="NDLSystemFont">Start</span>/<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Finish</span> pair is undefined. Note that this
function may be called as many times as desired between a pair of
calls to <span class="NDLSystemFont">StartAccumulating</span> and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">FinishAccumulating</span>. However,
callers of this function should attempt to register geometry with
an accumulator in as few calls to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RegisterObjectArray</span> as is reasonable.
Calling <span class="NDLSystemFont">RegisterObjectArray</span> at
a rate close to one call per visible object can adversely affect
performance.</p>

<p>Notes for authors of <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> objects: All
accumulators must be designed to handle a basically unbounded
number of objects registered in any number of calls to this
function between a pair of calls to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">StartAccumulating</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FinishAccumulating</span>. By convention, an
accumulator that makes any modifications to the objects
registered with it must restore these changes before returning
from this function. Also by convention, <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> objects should not
change the ordering of objects in the supplied <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiVisibleArray.htm">NiVisibleArray</a></span>
, nor should they add or delete any objects to/from the visible
array. Basically, while an accumulator can make changes to the
items in the visible arrays registered with it, in most cases, it
should return those objects to their original state before
exiting the function. Also, the accumulator should not make
changes to the visible arrays themselves. Finally, accumulators
must <em>not</em> keep references to the actual visible arrays
that are registered, as many applications reuse these visible
arrays several times in the same frame. The accumulator should
traverse each registered visible array <em>at the time of
registration</em> and use its own internal storage if it needs to
keep a reference to any geometry for later use in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FinishAccumulating</span>.</p>

<h3>FinishAccumulating</h3>

<p>This function "closes" the current
accumulation pass, rendering any remaining objects that were
deferred by earlier calls to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RegisterObjectArray</span>. Obviously, it must be
called only on an object that has been "opened" with a call to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">StartAccumulating</span> and has not
yet been closed by a matching call to this function.</p>

<p>Since this function often results in the
rendering of geometry that was registered via an earlier call to
<span class="NDLSystemFont">RegisterObjectArray</span> , all of
the prerequisites that apply to immediate geometry rendering
apply to <span class="NDLSystemFont">FinishAccumulating</span> as
well. See <a href="Rendering_a_Frame.htm">Rendering a Frame</a>
for details of these prerequisites.</p>

<p>Notes for authors of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm">NiAccumulator</a>s</span>:
All accumulators that defer and store registered objects for
rendering in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FinishAccumulating</span> must be designed to
handle a basically unbounded number of such objects. In addition,
by convention an accumulator that makes any modifications to the
objects registered with it must restore these changes before
returning from this function. Finally, an accumulator must not
hold pointers to registered objects at the end of this function.
The accumulator should be considered to be reset with respect to
geometry at the end of this function.</p>

<h2>The Common Case: NiAlphaAccumulator</h2>

<p>The most commonly-used accumulator in
Gamebryo is the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAlphaAccumulator.htm">NiAlphaAccumulator</a></span>.
Most Gamebryo samples and tools use this accumulator to sort all
renderable objects. In the presence of partially transparent
(i.e. alpha blended) objects, artifacts can occur if the
transparent objects are not drawn in back-to-front order a depth
buffer alone cannot resolve these issues. Sorted rendering with
an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAlphaAccumulator.htm">NiAlphaAccumulator</a></span>
allows dynamic and static objects to be sorted back-to-front each
frame.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAlphaAccumulator.htm">NiAlphaAccumulator</a></span>
is derived from <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm">NiAccumulator</a></span>,
and uses a simple form of back-to-front sorting (sorting by depth
of the bounding sphere center), but it does not register all
objects in the scene graph. As visible object arrays are
registered, the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAlphaAccumulator.htm">NiAlphaAccumulator</a></span>
looks at the set of rendering properties that are attached to
each leaf geometry object. If a geometry object has alpha
blending turned off, then the object is not registered&mdash;it
is sent to the renderer immediately for drawing. Objects that
have alpha blending turned on are registered for later rendering
in back-to-front order during the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FinishAccumulating</span> function. As a result,
the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAlphaAccumulator.htm">NiAlphaAccumulator</a></span>
draws all opaque objects first in the order traversed (letting
the Z-buffer take care of sorting them), and then draws all of
the alpha blended objects second, in back-to-front order. This
makes the sorter faster than a full sort of all visible geometry,
as it only sorts the (generally fewer) translucent objects, and
draws the others immediately.</p>

<h2>Automatic Usage of NiAccumulators</h2>

<p>So far, we have discussed the explicit use of accumulators to
register renderable objects in an application. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderer</span> interfaces include the ability
to store an <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> upon the renderer as a
convenience. The renderer makes no direct use of this
accumulator. However, various Gamebryo-supplied rendering
convenience functions do use them. The three <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDrawSceneUtility.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawSceneUtility</span></a> functions use the
accumulator attached to the renderer (if any) as follows:</p>

<p><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDrawSceneUtility.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawScene</span></a> and <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDrawSceneUtility.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawVisibleArray</span></a> both call
<span class="NDLSystemFont">StartAccumulating</span> upon the
renderer's accumulator (if any), register all visible geometry
sent to the function (culled in the former case, as supplied in
the latter case), and call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">FinishAccumulating</span> prior to returning,
thus implementing a full sorted rendering pass.</p>

<p>Since the default <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiApplication/Introduction_to_NiApplication.htm">
NiApplication</a>::RenderFrame</span> uses <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDrawSceneUtility.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawScene</span></a>, applications using the
default <a href=
"../../Reference/NiApplication/Introduction_to_NiApplication.htm">
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span></a> rendering
behavior will get sorted rendering automatically by attaching an
<a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> to the renderer.</p>

<p><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDrawSceneUtility.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawVisibleArrayAppend</span></a> "appends"
renderable objects to the renderer's accumulator using
<span class="NDLSystemFont">RegisterObjectArray</span>. As a
result, if the renderer is holding a pointer to a non-NULL
accumulator, then that accumulator must have been "opened" using
<span class="NDLSystemFont">StartAccumulating</span> prior to the
call to <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDrawSceneUtility.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawVisibleArrayAppend</span></a>. The caller
is also responsible for "closing" the accumulator after the call
to <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDrawSceneUtility.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawVisibleArrayAppend</span></a>. It is
possible to make as many calls to <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiDrawSceneUtility.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawVisibleArrayAppend</span></a> as desired
between accumulator <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Start</span>/<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Finish</span> pairs.</p>

<h2>Accumulators as Modifiers</h2>

<p>Since an <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> is fully responsible for
rendering the geometry that is registered with it, it has the
ability to do much more than basic depth sorting. For example,
several Gamebryo samples use subclasses of <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> to implement per-object
modifiers or pre-processors upon the geometry to be rendered. The
most common of these methods is for the accumulator to swap new
render state upon each object in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RegisterObjectArray</span>, render the object,
and then restore the original render state. For example, the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">RegisterObjectArray</span> function
for the following (hypothetical) <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UnlitAccumulator</span> disables all lights and
projected textures on each object, renders the object, and then
restores the lights and projected textures to the object.</p>
<pre>
void UnlitAccumulator::RegisterObjectArray(NiVisibleArray&amp; kArray)
{
    // Loop over all registered objects
    const unsigned int uiQuantity = kArray.GetCount();
    for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; uiQuantity; i++)
    {
        NiRenderObject&amp; kRenderObj = kArray.GetAt(i);
        // Cache the effect state and replace it
        NiDynamicEffectStatePtr spEffects = kRenderObj.GetEffectState();
        kRenderObj.SetEffectState(NULL);
        // Render the modified object
        kRenderObj.RenderImmediate(NiRenderer::GetRenderer());
        // Restore the object's original state
        kRenderObj.SetEffectState(spEffects);
     }
}
</pre>

<p>Other similar accumulators temporarily replace rendering
properties in the renderable object's <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiPropertyState.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPropertyState</span></a> or replace the
geometry object's shader. The possibilities within an <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> are basically limitless.
For examples of advanced accumulators, see the following Gamebryo
demo applications:</p>

<p><a href=
"../../Learn/Demos/StandardMaterial_Demo_Overview.htm">StandardMaterial</a>:
Includes an accumulator that replaces the rendering state and
effects state of each object</p>

<p><a href=
"../../Learn/FullDemos/MetalWars_Overview.htm">MetalWars</a>:
Includes an accumulator that implements a Z-only rendering pass.
This accumulator causes the opaque objects in the scene to be
drawn to the depth buffer only, pre-filling the depth buffer.
This pre-render avoids having to apply (potentially expensive)
shaders to hidden renderable objects in the later color-rendering
pass.</p>

<h2>Disabling Sorting per-Object: NiSortAdjustNode</h2>

<p>Some <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> subclasses (most notably
<a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAlphaAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAlphaAccumulator</span></a>) obey the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderObject.htm">NiRenderObject</a></span><span class="NDLSystemFont">
::GetSortObject</span> flag. This is a boolean flag that is
defined per renderable object that indicates whether the object
should be involved in sorting operations. <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> objects that obey this
flag will immediately render any object whose <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">GetSortObject</span> flag is <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">false</span>. The main writer of this flag is the
<a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiSortAdjustNode.htm"><span class="NDLSystemFont">
NiSortAdjustNode</span></a>, which can set this flag to false on
all of its (recursive) children during the culling pass, causing
those children to be rendered directly. Applications that do not
use the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiSortAdjustNode.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSortAdjustNode</span></a> can also set these
flags to <span class="NDLSystemFont">false</span> to disable
sorting on individual objects. By default, the sorting flag is
<span class="NDLSystemFont">true</span>, indicating that the
object should be sorted.</p>

<p>When used in conjunction with the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAlphaAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAlphaAccumulator</span></a>, an <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiSortAdjustNode.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSortAdjustNode</span></a> (in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SORTING_OFF</span> mode) can allow an application
to mark alpha blended objects to be treated as if they were
opaque (i.e. rendered immediately in the order they are found in
the scene graph). This can be useful in cases where the
depth-sorting algorithms used by the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAlphaAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAlphaAccumulator</span></a> cause "flashing"
(rapid changes in sorting order) as the viewpoint changes. See
the artists' documentation section <a href=
"../../Art/Max/Nodes.htm#Sort_Adjust_Nodes">Sort Adjust Nodes</a>
for usage details.</p>

<h2>Using Multiple Accumulators per Frame</h2>

<p>While the accumulator functions require that the renderer be
prepared for geometry rendering prior to an accumulator
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Start</span>/<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Register</span>/<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Finish</span> sequence, there is no need for the
renderer to finish a frame immediately after finishing the first
accumulator sequence. In fact, it is possible to reuse the same
accumulator for several <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Start</span>/<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Register</span>/<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Finish</span> sequences during the rendering of a
single render target group. In addition, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Start</span>/<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Register</span>/<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Finish</span> sequences could be called on
several different accumulators within the rendering of a single
render target group. In addition, it is possible to ignore an
open accumulator and manually render geometry immediately (using
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderObject.htm">NiRenderObject</a></span><span class="NDLSystemFont">
::RenderImmediate</span>) if desired.</p>

<h2>NiRenderListProcessor</h2>

<p>A way to use functionality similar to an <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAccumulator.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span></a> in the frame rendering
system is to use <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderListProcessor.htm">NiRenderListProcessor</a></span>
objects. These are described in more detail <a href=
"../Frame_Rendering_System/Frame_Rendering_System_Render_List_Processor.htm">
here</a>.</p>
