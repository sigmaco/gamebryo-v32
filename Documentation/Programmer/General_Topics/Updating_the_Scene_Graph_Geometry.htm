<h1>Updating the Scene Graph Geometry</h1>

<p>An application may change the local transformations of a node as needed. The
computation of the world transformation for the node and any transformations of
descendants of that node are deferred until the application makes a call to an
update routine.</p>

<p>The update is efficient in that it does a single depth-first traversal of
the subgraph to compute world transformations and world bounding spheres,
thereby minimizing the number of nodes visited. While recursing down a path,
the transformations are updated. Once a node's transformations are updated, the
recursion continues to each child of the node. After updating the matrices, the
world bounding spheres are updated on the upward return from the recursive
calls.</p>

<p>In summary, transformations are updated while recursing down a path, and
bounding spheres are updated while returning up a path.</p>

<p>Usually most objects in a world are not moving, so the updates are
restricted to only a few moving objects. To initialize the processing of a
scene graph, the update routine must be called at least once at the root of the
graph before an application uses the scene graph. This approach guarantees
that all the local and world information at the nodes is up-to-date.</p>

<p>During frame-to-frame application runtime, applications must call
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> on an object "O" if any of the
following criteria are met:</p>

<ul>
    <li>O is attached to or detached from a parent (direct parent only not a
    "grandparent", and so on)</li>

    <li>O has a new child attached or a current child detached (direct children
    only not "grandchildren", and so on)</li>

    <li>Any of O's transforms are changed</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that a call to <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> on the current
parent or any current ancestor can substitute for a call to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> on the object itself. For example, if object A
attaches children B and C, then a call to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">A-&gt;Update</span> will suffice. It is not necessary to call
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> on all three objects. Applications
can and should "batch" calls to update in this way.</p>

<p>For example, if an application makes changes to all of the "joint"
transforms of an articulated character, it should defer calling update until
all changes are made. It can then call <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> once, at the root node of the character.</p>

<p>However, note that <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> should be
called as low on the scene graph as possible. Calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Update</span> on the root of the scene graph every frame when
only a single leaf has changed is excessive, and will lower performance.</p>
