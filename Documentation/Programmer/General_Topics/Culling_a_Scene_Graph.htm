<h1>Culling a Scene Graph</h1>

<h2>Determining which Objects to Render</h2>

<p>Gamebryo splits the concept of a hierarchical scene graph from
the actual process of rendering. While scene graphs contain
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span> subclasses,
including internal grouping nodes and leaves that may or may not
contain renderable objects, the process of renderingonly consumes
renderable leaf objects. The rendering subsystems are designed to
deal with <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span>
subclasses and flat, array-like containers that hold collections
of these <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span>
objects <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span>). In
fact, the rendering subsystem has no need for or knowledge of the
hierarchy that is defined by the scene graph, only the leaf
geometries.</p>

<p>Having prepared all of the renderable objects in a scene graph
for rendering, the next important step is generating the visible
set of leaf <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span>
objects that form the input to the next stage in the pipeline,
low-level rendering. It is too expensive computationally to
simply take all of the leaf geometry objects in the scene and
send them to the renderer directly. We must extract the
potentially visible subset of these for the current view. The
easiest way to determine which of the many leaf renderable
objects in a scene graphare potentially visible in a given frame
from a specific camera's point-of-viewis the process of culling,
and it is implemented in Gamebryo via the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> class.</p>

<p>The culling process takes a hierarchical scene graph and a
camera and produces a flat array (an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span>) of the leaf renderable
objects contained in the scene graph that are potentially visible
from the camera. "Potentially visible" means that some objects
may be placed on the list even if they are occluded by others,
etc. The process of culling is designed to be fast and
conservative - some culling methods may include objects that do
not actually end up being visible for one reason or another, but
no correctly-written culling process should leave out a visible
object.</p>

<h2>The Concept of Hierarchical Culling</h2>

<p>Scene graph culling is a hierarchical walk of the scene graph,
looking for visible leaf renderable objects. The traversal is
generally a partial traversal, as an entire sub-tree of a scene
graph can be skipped if the bounding sphere of aninternal scene
graph node is found to be outside of the view frustum. This is
possible because the update process ensures that the world
bounding sphere at each node encloses the bounding volumes of its
sub-tree. If a given node falls entirely outside of the view
frustum, then nothing under it in the hierarchy can be visible.
When the culling traversal finds that it has reached a leaf
renderable object that is visible (and not marked as "app culled"
via the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject::GetAppCulled()</span> function), the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> object
appends that renderable object to its <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> container (for later
rendering).</p>

<p>Thus, after each culling traversal of a scene graph, the
internal and leaf nodes all fall into one of three categories:
objects that were traversed and found to be visible (and thus
processed further), objects that were found to be invisible (and
thus not processed any further), and objects that were never
traversed at all (because one of their recursive parents was
found to be invisible). This lattermost category costs nothing in
terms of computation and thus is the most attractive case. An
example of a scene graph that is colored according to a
hypothetical culling traversal is shown below.</p>

<h2>Culling and NiDrawScene</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDrawScene</span> global
drawing utility function culls and renders geometry in a single
call. Many Gamebryo applications and most of the Gamebryo samples
use this function to accomplish both their culling and rendering
functionality. The rendering behavior of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawScene</span> is discussed in the section
<a href="Rendering_Meshes.htm">Rendering Meshes</a>.</p>

<p>The function also does a culling traversal. Prior to
rendering, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDrawScene</span>
generates the set of geometry to be rendered by performing a
culling operation using all of the four arguments sent to it. It
uses the visible array that is passed in (or the one attached to
the culling process if the visible array argument is <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NULL</span>, see below) as the destination of the
culling operation. Any object that existed in the visible array
prior to the call to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawScene</span> is cleared out prior to
culling. Thus, the renderable objects in the visible array after
culling are only the newly-culled objects. The resulting visible
array is then rendered by <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiDrawScene</span>, using the methods described
in <a href="Rendering_Meshes.htm">Rendering Meshes</a>.</p>

<p>The result of this automated behavior is that some more basic
applications will never need to do anything more with the
culling-specific objects <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> other than create them and
pass them in to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDrawScene</span>.
The following sections provide details regarding the
functionality of the various culling-related objects, and also
provide details of the inner workings of hierarchical culling in
Gamebryo. These will be of interest to most application
developers.</p>

<h2>Top-level Culling Objects</h2>

<p>There are four objects that must be available in order to
successfully cull a scene graph into an array of visible
geometry. These four objects fall into three categories:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The source objects: The scene graph (represented by its
    root <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span>) that
    represents the world to be culled and the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span> that represents the view from
    which we will cull</li>

    <li>The processing object: The <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>, which implements the
    mechanics of the culling algorithm itself</li>

    <li>The destination object: The <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span>, to which are added
    references to each of the visible leaf geometry objects in
    the scene</li>
</ul>

<p>The requirements regarding the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span> and the scene graph prior to
culling are described elsewhere in the section <a href=
"Preparing_a_Scene_for_Rendering.htm">Preparinga Scenefor
Rendering</a>. The other two objects are specific to culling
and/or rendering. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> is the simpler of the two,
as it provides nothing more than a simple, automatically growing
container to hold references to the visible geometry objects.
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> is a more
complex object, but only two of its memberfunctions are of
interest to an application-level user. The following sections
discuss the basic usage of these two objects with respect to
culling.</p>

<h3>NiVisibleArray</h3>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> implements
an array-based container of references to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span> objects. It represents the
communication between culling and rendering, as it is the result
of culling <em>and</em> the source of objects for sorting and
rendering. Ignoring rendering itself for now (the rendering of
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> objects is
covered in the section <a href="Rendering_Meshes.htm">Rendering
Meshes</a>), applications that invoke culling directly will need
to use <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> objects
explicitly in three places: creation of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span>, passing the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> into the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>, resetting the visible
array each frame.</p>

<p>Creating an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span>
is simple;</p>

<p>NiVisibleArray* pkVisible = NiNew NiVisibleArray;</p>

<p>will create an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> object with default initial
size (the number of elements in the array as allocated initially)
and "grow by" increment (the number of elements that will be
appended to the end of the array each time the existing storage
is filled). Larger numbers for either will avoid fragmentation
from many reallocations if the array must grow during culling,
but using numbers that are much larger than the expected size of
the array (i.e. the number of expected visible objects) will
waste memory. See the reference documentation for <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> for details on how to find
the default size for these values. Alternatively, the application
can explicitly send the initial size and "grow by" values
explicitly to the constructor; this allows the application to
size the visible array at startup according to the expected
number of objects per culling operation:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray* pkVisible = NiNew
NiVisibleArray(uiInitialSize, uiGrowBy);</span></p>

<p>Having created the visible array object, the visible array
needs to be passed to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> for use in culling
operations. The most common way of doing this is to passthe
visible array into the<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> constructor. If passed in
at creation, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>can use that <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> implicitly as the
destination of all culling operations. Alternatively, an
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> may be passed
in to the culling process in the culling call itself (as will be
discussed below). However, the simpler case is to pass the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> to the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> constructor.
Note that the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>
does not take ownership of its <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> - it is the responsibility
of the application to delete it:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess* pkCuller = NiNew
NiCullingProcess(pkVisible);</span></p>

<p>In fact, many Gamebryo sample applications handle all of these
steps (including deletion of both objects) in four very simple
lines. They declare each of the objects in their application
class header:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray
m_kVisible;</span></p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess
m_kCuller;</span></p>

<p>and then initialize them as follows in the constructor's
initialization list:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">m_kVisible(1024, 1024),</span></p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess
m_kCuller(&amp;m_kVisible),</span></p>

<p>The only other step that must be done manually for
applications calling culling explicitly is to clear out any
existing objects from the visible array after rendering it and
before culling the next frame (or batch of renderable objects).
At the beginning of the frame (or right before culling in some
cases), the array needs to be reset to empty, since the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> appends
renderable objects onto an existing array, rather than clearing
it first (this affords more flexibility by allowing several
culling operations to append onto the end of the same array). The
function is <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray::RemoveAll()</span>.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">m_kVisible.RemoveAll();</span></p>

<p>The other functions contained in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> are for the purposes of
traversing the geometry objects that were added via the culling
process. Several of these functions are described in <a href=
"Rendering_Meshes.htm">Rendering Meshes</a>.</p>

<h3>NiCullingProcess</h3>

<p>Construction of an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> was discussed briefly in
the section above. The single argument to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> constructor is a pointer
to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> to which
the culling process object should append geometry by default.
This can be passed as <span class="NDLSystemFont">NULL</span> if
desired, but most applications will provide a default visible
array at construction time. The culling process does not take
ownership of itsvisible arrayand will not delete the visible
array upon destruction.</p>

<p>There is only one additional member function of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> that is of interest to
most applications; <span class="NDLSystemFont">Process</span>.
However, this is the single most pivotal function in the entire
culling system:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">void Process(const NiCamera*
pkCamera, NiAVObject* pkScene, NiVisibleArray*
pkVisibleSet)</span></p>

<p>At the highest level, this function causes the calling culling
process to cull the given scene from the point-of-view of the
given camera, appending the potentially visible leaf <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span> objects from the scene
graph onto the end of an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span>.</p>

<p>The first argument must be a valid, updated <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCamera</span> that defines the view. Culling
will be done from the point-of-view of this camera. The second
argument must be a valid, updated scene graph root that defines
the renderable objects to be viewed by the camera.</p>

<p>The third argument is optional in most cases - if a
non-<span class="NDLSystemFont">NULL</span> visible array is
passed into the third argument, then it is this visible array
that is used as the destination of the culling operation. If
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NULL</span> is passed in as the third
argument, then the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> object's internal
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> (set at
construction time or by a later call to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess::SetVisibleSet</span>) is used.
If the both the argument and the internally-held <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> are both NULL, then the
function returns without doing any culling.</p>

<p>When the function returns, the destination visible array (as
described in the paragraph above) will contain the visible
renderable objects from the scene, appended onto whatever
renderable objects were in the visible array prior to the call.
It is this visible array that is used directly by the next step
in the scene-drawing process, rendering. Rendering is discussed
in detail in the section <a href="Rendering_Meshes.htm">Rendering
Meshes</a> .</p>

<h2>Advanced Discussion: The Mechanics of Culling</h2>

<p>Culling is a recursive process. The recursion itselfinvolves
two major types of object and several additional "helper"
objects. The major objects involved in the recursion are the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObjects</span> (and subclasses)
that form the hierarchical scene graph and the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> object itself. The result
of the culling pass is that the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> object will have placed
references to the visible leaf <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject</span> objects within the given
scene graph into an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiVisibleArray</span> that is stored in the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>. The scene
graph objects and the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> are both active
participants in the culling traversal.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>
implements the act of determining whether a given object in the
hierarchy is visible in and of itself. In the case of the base
class <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>, this
involves testing the scene graph object's world-space bounding
sphere against a set of view frustum planes that represent the
camera. These view frustum planes are stored in an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiFrustumPlanes</span> object within the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>.</p>

<p>When the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>
determines that a given scene graph object is visible by the
aforementioned test, it calls <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject::OnVisible</span> on the scene graph
object in question. <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnVisible</span>
is virtual, and implements different "on visible" behavior for
each type of scene graph object. Visible internal nodes pass
their children to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> object (via <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess::Process(NiAVObject*)</span>)in
order to continue the recursion. Visible leaf geometry nodes pass
themselves back to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess (via
NiCullingProcess::Append)</span> to be added to the list of
visible geometry.</p>

<p>Thus, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>
handles the visibility testing of each potentially visible object
in the hierarchy and the registration of visible leaf geometry
objects into the array of visible objects. The scene graph
objects themselves implement the per-node hierarchical traversal
behavior. This splits the responsibilities quite cleanly, and
allows for advanced behavior in both the scene graph traversal
dimension (e.g. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiLODNode</span>,
which traverses only the child representing themost appropriate
level of detail) and in the culling dimension (e.g. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiFixtureCuller</span>, an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> that ensures that
cell-portal scenes do not register any single geometry object
more than once per culling pass).</p>

<p>To relate this discussion to the figure above, we consider the
meaning of each shading color with respect to the culling-related
functions that will have been called upon or with that
object.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Any object marked in gray (not visited) has had none of
    the above calls invoked upon it or with it as an argument -
    culling has not considered it at all in this pass.</li>

    <li>Any object marked in black (visited, not visible) has had
    <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess::Process(NiAVObject*)</span>
    called with it, but has <em>not</em> had <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject::OnVisible</span> called upon it.
    In other words, objects shaded black were tested by the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span>, but were
    found not to be visible.</li>

    <li>Any objectmarked inwhite (visited, visible) have had both
    <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess::Process(NiAVObject*)</span>
    called with it, and had <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject::OnVisible</span> called upon it.
    In other words, objects shadedwhite were tested by the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess</span> andwere
    foundto be visible, requiring further processing. If the
    visible object is an internal node, this will lead to
    <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess::Process(NiAVObject*)</span>
    being called on each of its children. If the visible object
    is a leaf geometry node, this will lead to the object calling
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCullingProcess::Append</span>
    upon itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result of most culling operations will be that the visible
array is filled with visible objects that are added in the order
in which they were found in the scene graph traversal - namely,a
depth-firsttraversal (in scene graph terms, <em>not</em> view
depth!),in order ofincreasing child index within a node. However,
each subclass of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span> can
override the exact traversal method, as mentioned above.
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSwitchNode</span>, for
exampletraverses only a single, selected child during
culling.</p>

<h2>Culling and the NiSortAdjustNode</h2>

<p>One type of node in the scene graph hierarchy adds additional
behavior during the culling passwhose effectis not actually
realized until the (later) rendering stage; <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSortAdjustNode</span>. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSortAdjustNode</span> is different from most
other scene graph classes in that it "tags" the visible leaf
geometry objects under it during a culling traversal. The "tags"
it sets are the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiRenderObject::Set/GetSortObject</span> flags.
These flags are used later in the process by some <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAccumulator</span> objects during sorted
rendering to adjust the sorting behavior. See the documentation
sections <a href="Rendering_Meshes.htm">Rendering Meshes</a>and
<a href="Object_Sorting.htm">Object Sorting</a> for details of
geometry rendering, both sorted and unsorted. The initial
"tagging" work is done during the culling pass because the
culling phase is the last hierarchical stage in the drawing
pipeline. For more details on <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSortAdjustNode</span> and how it fits into the
process of sorted rendering, see the documentation sections on
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiSortAdjustNode.htm">NiSortAdjustNode</a></span>
and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAlphaAccumulator.htm">NiAlphaAccumulator</a></span>.</p>
