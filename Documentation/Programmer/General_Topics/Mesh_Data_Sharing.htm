<h1>Mesh Data Sharing</h1>

<p>For worlds with objects that require only a small number 
 of vertices, a tree can represent the scene graph. Each object is 
 uniquely represented as a node in the tree. However, there may be 
 times when a single object is complex and requires a large amount of memory 
 to represent it  in most scene graphs, the vast majority of memory is 
 consumed by texture and per-vertex data such as texture coordinates and 
 normals. </p>

<p>If multiple copies of such an object are necessary in 
 the application, it is possible to share the model-space geometry, color, 
 texture, and other data through shared <a HREF="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span></a> objects. In other words, multiple leaf mesh objects may share <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span></a> objects, in which case the 
 scene graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), rather than a tree.</p>

<p>In the case of geometric data sharing, the leaf mesh 
 objects share the model-space mesh of the <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span></a> object. However, the 
 two "instances" of the model data live in different parts of 
 the world, as they are represented by multiple mesh objects, and separate 
 transforms are be maintained for each of the copies. </p>

<p>The management is handled internally and is transparent 
 to the application&mdash;the application need only create two mesh objects 
 using the same <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span></a> objects. The mesh objects are much smaller than even a minimal  set of mesh data, since mesh objects, unlike data streams , have no per vertex data.</p>

<p>A typical situation is shown in the next figure.</p>

<p>Two leaf mesh objects share the Wheel position and normal 
 <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span></a> objects. One mesh object 
 corresponds to the front wheel of a bicycle. The other mesh object 
 corresponds to the back wheel of a bicycle. The position and normal 
 <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span></a> objects themselves store the 
 model vertices for sharing. Internally, both of the mesh objects 
 store world transforms for its representation of the mesh. </p>

<p>Note that Gamebryo does not support multiple parents 
 for any type of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a></span>. Attaching 
 any object "C" as a child of another parent object will result 
 in "C" being automatically detached from its original parent 
 (if it already had a parent).</p>

 and Data Streams</a>.</p>
