<h1>Understanding System Service Priorities and Dependencies</h1>

<p>As described in the <a href="system_service_overview.htm">System services overview</a>
documentation every frame each system service has one <span class="NDLSystemFont">
efd::ISystemService</span> method invoked based on the state of that particular service. Further as
outlined in the <a href="system_service_features.htm">System service features</a> documentation the
order in which these methods are invoked on different services is controlled by a combination of
priority and dependencies. In this documentation topic we will examine the interaction of priority
and dependency using a detailed example. For the purpose of this example, we will be examining a
process with the following services:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Service Name</th><th>Priority</th><th>Dependent services</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>A</td><td>1000</td><td>B, C, D</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>B</td><td>2000</td><td>C</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>C</td><td>1500</td><td><em>none</em></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>D</td><td>2500</td><td><em>none</em></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>E</td><td>500</td><td><em>none</em></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The dependencies listed in the table above can be constructed into a dependency diagram in order
to easily visualize the service relationships:</p>
<div class="NDLFigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/DependencyGraph.png" width="333" height="297" alt="Dependency graph for
        example services"/>
    <p class="NDLFigureCaption">Dependency graph for example services</p>
</div>
<p>The Service Manager guarantees that all services are initialized before any service that depends
on them, so in our example service C must be initialized before service B and service B must be
initialized before service A. The other thing to notice is that not all services have any
restrictions with regard to other services, in our example service E could be initialized at any
point and service D could be initialized before or after B and C so long as it precedes service A.
In order to make service initialization order a bit more deterministic, the service manager applies
two heuristics when generating the topological order for the dependency graph:</p>
<ul>
    <li>First, services with a deeper depth in the dependency graph are initialized before services
    with a lower depth. This heuristic helps ensure commonly depended upon services are initialized
    first just in case some services have neglected to express their proper dependencies. In our
    example, service C is at a depth of three so it will be initialized first (notice the deepest
    possible path determined the depth for the service). Services B and D are at depth two so they
    will be initialized next. And services A and E are at depth one so they will be initialized
    last.</li>
    <li>Second, services at the same depth in the dependency graph are sorted by their service
    priorities. This heuristic is completely arbitrary and is used simply to ensure a more well
    defined order of initialization. As with ticking, a higher priority will be initialized before a
    lower priority for those items at the same depth. In our example, D (priority 2500) will
    initialize before B (priority 2000) and A (priority 1000) will initialize before E (priority
    500).</li>
</ul>
<p>If two services have the same depth and the same priority then it is undefined what order they
will be initialized relative to each other. So based on the dependencies, priority and heuristics we
have the following results for our example:</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Dependency Order:</td><td>C, D, B, A, E</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Priority Order:</td><td>D, B, C, A, E</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>Lets examine what will happen frame-by-frame for our example services when ServiceManager::Run
is called. In order to understand this we will need to know something about the behavior of the
OnInit, OnTick and OnShutdown methods for each of our services. Lets assume these methods behave as
described in the following table:</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Service Name</th>
            <th>OnInit behavior</th>
            <th>OnTick behavior</th>
            <th>OnShutdown behavior</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>A</td>
            <td>Requires two calls to complete</td>
            <td>Runs forever</td>
            <td>Always completes in one call</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>B</td>
            <td>Always completes in one call</td>
            <td>Runs forever</td>
            <td>Always completes in one call</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>C</td>
            <td>Always completes in one call</td>
            <td>Always completes in one call</td>
            <td>Always completes in one call</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>D</td>
            <td>Requires two calls to complete</td>
            <td>Runs forever</td>
            <td>Always completes in one call</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>E</td>
            <td>Always completes in one call</td>
            <td>Runs forever</td>
            <td>Requires two calls to complete</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The result will be the following first few frames of our application:</p>

<div class="NDLFigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/MethodCallOrder.png" width="770" height="398" alt="Method invocation order
        during initialization seperated by frame"/>
    <p class="NDLFigureCaption">Method invocation order during initialization separated by frame</p>
</div>

<p>Important details concerning this result:</p>
<ul>
    <li>OnInit will be called in dependency order.</li>
    <li>Because C::OnInit finished in a single call, D::OnInit was also called on the first frame.
        </li>
    <li>Even though B does not depend on D, when D::OnInit returned a pending result in the first
        frame no more initialization was performed on that frame. Once the initialization order is
        computed services are initialized one at a time in that order.</li>
    <li>On the second frame, initialization continued in the initialization order. D::OnInit
        was called and finished, so then B::OnInit was called which also finished and finally
        A::OnInit was called but returned pending thus stopping the initialization for this frame.
        </li>
    <li>Since C has already completed its initialization it has C::OnTick called during the second
        frame even though other services are still pending initialization.</li>
    <li>The OnTick calls for a frame do not start until the OnInit calls for the frame are
        completed.</li>
    <li>Initialization continues in the third frame with A::OnInit and then E::OnInit both
        completing in initialization order.</li>
    <li>Frame three finishes with D::OnTick and B::OnTick being called in priority order. D has a
        higher priority so it is called before B.</li>
    <li>Note that C::OnTick is not called in the third and subsequent frames because it returned
        complete when it was first called.</li>
    <li>By frame 4 all services are initialized so they each simply have OnTick called in priority
        order.</li>
    <li>Subsequent frames will be the same as frame 4 until application shutdown begins.</li>
</ul>

<p>The procedure for dealing with process shutdown is very similar. Lets assume that on the ninth
frame the ServiceManager::Shutdown method is called. Given what we know about our services, the
result will be the following:</p>
<div class="NDLFigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/ShutdownOrder.png" width="746" height="398" alt="Method invocation order
        during shutdown seperated by frame"/>
    <p class="NDLFigureCaption">Method invocation order during shutdown separated by frame</p>
</div>
<p>Important details concerning this result:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Even though ServiceManager::Shutdown was called on frame nine, that frame continues as
        normal.</li>
    <li>Starting on frame ten OnShutdown will be called in reverse Dependency Order.</li>
    <li>Because E::OnShutdown returns pending, remaining services are ticked in their normal
        priority order.</li>
    <li>During application shutdown, the OnTick calls for a frame do not start until the OnShutdown
        calls for the frame are completed. This may seem counter-intuitive at first, but the
        OnShutdown calls must be made first in order to determine which services will complete their
        shutdown and which services will still require an OnTick call.</li>
    <li>On frame eleven, all services complete OnShutdown in reverse dependency order. This will
        end the ServiceManager::Run call and typically lead to process termination.</li>
</ul>
