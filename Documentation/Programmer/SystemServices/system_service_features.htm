<h1>System service features</h1>

<p>The following provides a brief overview of features that are common to all system services.</p>

<h4>ISystemService base class (<a href="../../Reference/efd/efd__ISystemService.htm">efd::ISystemService</a>)</h4>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">efd::ISystemService</span> is the base class that is common to all
system services. This base class provides a set of virtual methods that each system service can
override. Because default implementations for all of the On* methods are provided, subclasses only
need to implement the functions that are necessary for the service to operate. These functions
include the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">GetDisplayName</span>&mdash;useful to distinguish system
        services in log messages.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">OnServiceRegistered</span>&mdash;called when the service is
        registered with the Service Manager to allow for the registration of service aliases.
        Services that derive from other services should implement this method.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span>&mdash;called once during startup to register
        dependencies and perform intialization work that doesn't depend on other services.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span>&mdash;called prior to starting tick cycles for
        perform any required initialization. We be called each frame until it returns <span
        class="NDLSystemFont">AsyncResult_Complete</span>.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTick</span>&mdash;called once per cycle until application
        shutdown or <span class="NDLSystemFont">AsyncResult_Complete</span> is returned.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span>&mdash;called to clean up resources during
        shutdown.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Service Manager (<a href="../../Reference/efd/efd__ServiceManager.htm">efd::ServiceManager</a>)</h4>

<p>Each system service is registered with one and only one Service Manager instance. The Service
Manager is responsible for the lifetime of each system service. It calls the OnPreInit, OnInit,
OnTick and OnShutdown message on each system service in the appropriate order as determined by
dependencies and priority.</p>

<h4>Service dependencies</h4>

<p>System services can express dependencies on other system services that control the order in
which the services are initialized and shutdown. Dependencies are registered when the <span
class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span> method is called on your service. The <span
class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span> method itself is called in whatever order the services were
added to the Service Manager. Each service is completely initialized before any service that depends
on it will receive it's first <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> call. Further, a service
will not receive any <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span> calls until every service that
depends on it has completed <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span>. In other words, by
expressing a dependency you are guarenteed that the service you depend on will be available for the
duration of your service. As soon as each service completes it's <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit
</span> phase that service will start receiving <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTick</span> calls on
the next frame. For further details on how to express system service dependencies, see the <a
href="../../Reference/efd/efd__IDependencyRegistrar.htm">efd::IDependencyRegistrar</a> interface
which is passed into the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span> method. To view the
dependencies of existing LightSpeed services, see the <a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/images/SystemServiceDependencies.png">Service dependency
diagram</a>.</p>

<h4>Service priorities</h4>

<p>Every system service has a priority which controls the order in which <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">OnTick</span> is called every frame. Services with a higher priority are ticked
before services with a lower priority. If two services have the same priority then the order in
which they are ticked relative to each other is undefined and may vary. All services have a default
priority that is implemented by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">efd::ISystemService</span>
interface; services can set their default priority during their constructors by setting the <span
class="NDLSystemFont">m_defaultPriority</span> variable. Optionally, when you register a system
service with the Service Manager, you can override the default priority of the service. For details
on the default priorities used by LightSpeed services, see <a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_intro.htm">System Services Quick Reference</a>.</p>

<h4>Service aliases</h4>

<p>All system services are uniquely identified within the Service Manager by an <span
class="NDLSystemFont">efd::SSID</span> (System Service IDentifier). The SSID is simply an <span
class="NDLSystemFont">efd::ClassID</span> that has a slightly restricted range of valid values. When
a service derives from an existing service and extends it's functionality it can be useful to refer
to the service by either the base class SSID or the derived class SSID. To support this, services
can register aliases during a special callback that is made when the service is registered. For
further details on registering aliases, see the <a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__IAliasRegistrar.htm">efd::IAliasRegistrar</a> interface which is provided
to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ISystemService::OnServiceRegistered</span> calback made during
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ServiceManager::RegisterSystemService</span>.</p>

<h4>Access to other system services</h4>

<p>All classes that derive from the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ISystemService</span> base class
contain a pointer to its controlling Service Manager. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">
m_pServiceManager</span> member variable is assigned when the system service is registered with the
Service Manager. You can use this pointer to gain direct access to other system services by using
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetSystemService</span> or <span class="NDLSystemFont">
GetSystemServiceAs</span> functions.</p>
