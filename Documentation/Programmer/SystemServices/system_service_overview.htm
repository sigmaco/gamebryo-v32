<h1>System services overview</h1>

<p>A system service is a functional module that is designed to share compute cycles with other
system services. A typical application that is based on the Emergent Game Framework is composed of
one or more system services. A system service should be responsible for one functional area of the
application. Examples of systems services include the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efdLogService/efd__LogService.htm">efd::LogService</a></span>, the <span
class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/egf/egf__Scheduler.htm">egf::Scheduler</a></span>,
and the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/efd/efd__MessageService.htm">
efd::MessageService</a></span>.</p>

<h3>efd::ServiceManager</h3>

<p>All system services are registered with the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__ServiceManager.htm">efd::ServiceManager</a></span> singleton. The job of
the Service Manager is to manage the lifetime events for every system service in the application.
(Note: this is not to be confused with managing game lifetime state, that is a higher level
concept.) The Service Manager maintains information about service dependencies and priorites which
determins the order in which services are initialized, ticked and shutdown.</p>

<h3>efd::ISystemService</h3>

<p>Every system service implements the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__ISystemService.htm">efd::ISystemService</a></span> interface, which
defines lifetime methods that are called at specific times during the life of the service:</p>

<ul>
    <li>OnPreInit</li>

    <li>OnInit</li>

    <li>OnTick</li>
<a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/images/SystemServiceDependencies.png">Service dependency
diagram</a>
    <li>OnShutdown</li>
</ul>

<p>One of these methods is invoked on a service each framework cycle, depending on the lifetime
state of that service. Different services can be at different lifetime stages. Several methods
return an asynchronous result, allowing service lifetime states to span multiple framework cycles.
</p>

<h4>OnPreInit</h4>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span> lifetime method is called after the system
service is registered with the Service Manager but before <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span>
is called. This allows the system service to perform any synchronous initialization steps that are
independent of all other services.</p>

<p>Other system services may exist in this state, but you cannot depend on them being in a ready
state. You should not call methods on other system services during <span class="NDLSystemFont">
OnPreInit</span> unless those methods are specifically documented as being callable during <span
class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span>. If your system service relies on the existence of another
system service, you should register that dependency during <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit
</span> and then wait until <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> to interact with the other
service. One important exception to this rule is the <a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__ConfigManager.htm">efd::ConfigManager</a>, which can be used during <span
class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span> to read configuration settings.</p>

<h4>OnInit</h4>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> lifetime method is called after the Service Manager
has called <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span> but before the first <span
class="NDLSystemFont">OnTick</span> call is made. All services for which you expressed a dependency
during <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span> will be fully initialized before your <span
class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> method is first called. It is safe to call all methods on these
system services in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> method, but service that you do not
depend on may not be initialized yet. It is possible for many ticks to pass between <span
class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span> and the first call to <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit
</span> as the Service Manager initialize the dependent services. Once <span class="NDLSystemFont">
OnInit</span> is completed, the system service will begin to receive <span class="NDLSystemFont">
OnTick</span> calls begining on the next frame even though other services may still be initializing.
</p>

<h4>OnTick</h4>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTick</span> lifetime method is called once per framework cycle
after the system service <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> method completes successfully.
This method implements the work done by the system service. The majority of a system services
lifetime is spent in <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTick</span>. The Service Manager will continue to
call <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTick</span> for the system service every cycle for as long as the
system service returns <span class="NDLSystemFont">AsyncResult_Pending</span> from <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">OnTick</span>.</p>

<h4>OnShutdown</h4>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span> lifetime method is called when the Service
Manager is preparing to shut down. Any clean up required by the system service happens in this
method. If you hold any references to other system services or shared resources, they should be
released during <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span>. All services that your service
depends on will continue to tick until your service completes <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown
</span>.</p>
