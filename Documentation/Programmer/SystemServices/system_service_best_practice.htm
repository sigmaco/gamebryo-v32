<h1>Best practices for working with system services</h1>

<p>Emergent recommends the following best practices when you are working with system services:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Create a system service for each major, relatively independent, possibly optional component
    of the application. One example would be the manager or controller for a game module such as
    path finding, combat resolution, or audio.</li>

    <li>If the module needs periodic or continuing cycles per frame, it is a candidate for a system
    service, or for being attached to an existing service. This is also true if the module is
    sensitive to initialization or shutdown order with respect to other services.</li>

    <li>To further increase the loose coupling between services consider using local messages for
    notification and interaction. This can allow services to be optionally used without
    complicating the services that use it. Simply send a message and if the message is received the
    correct action takes place. It can also allow other services to extend the service or respond
    to the same notification without needing to modify the service; extending services can simply
    subscribe to the same messages.</li>

    <li>Limit the number of system services to a few dozen. With too large a number of services, it
    becomes very challenging to find a workable order of initialization and shutdown, and the
    number of service ticks per frame can become a performance penalty. Further, there tend to a
    limited number of independent systems in a typical game application so if there are too many
    services it may be due to overly aggressive decomposition. Consider combining some services
    since it is unlikely they are truly independent or individually optional.</li>

    <li>Use the constructor only to initialize class variables, do not assume that other system
    services exist or are initialized.</li>

    <li>System services should avoid using constructor arguments; consider using configuration
    settings read during <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span> instead.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span> method is the first point at which it is
    safe to check for the existence of other services but you cannot assume any other service is
    ready for use. One important exception is the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/efd/efd__ConfigManager.htm">efd::ConfigManager</a></span> which can be safely
    used during <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span> to read your configuration settings.
    </li>

    <li>During <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span>, register dependencies on all services
    that your service relies on in order to function correctly. These dependencies ensure that the
    required services are initialized before your service and will not be shutdown until after your
    service. Some specific recommendations include:
    <ul>
        <li>If a service subscribes for messages, it should depend on the <span
            class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/efd/efd__MessageService.htm">
            efd::MessageService</a></span>.</li>
        <li>If a service creates entities from C++, it should depend on the <span
            class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/egf/egf__EntityManager.htm">
            egf::EntityManager</a></span>.</li>
        <li>If a service loads block files, it should depend on the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a
            href="../../Reference/egf/egf__EntityLoaderService.htm">egf::EntityLoaderService</a>
            </span>.</li>
        <li>If a service is also a render delegate, it should depend on the <span
            class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/ecr/ecr__RenderService.htm">
            ecr::RenderService</a></span>.</li>
    </ul>
    These are just examples, this is far from a comprehensive list. Consult the reference
    documentation for the methods used for additional dependency recommendations.
    </li>

    <li>Although you should liberally register dependencies for those services you require, it is
    best to avoid dependencies on other services if possible. The need to depend on another service
    may indicate poor service decomposition; use optional dependencies when you can or consider
    combining tightly coupled services into a single service.</li>

    <li>Use <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> to interact with other system services for the
    purpose of initialization. During <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> it is safe to assume
    that any service you registered a dependency on will be fully initialized. Other non-dependent
    services are unlikely to be initialized and their direct usage should be avoid unless you are
    calling an API specifically documented as being safe to call prior to that service being
    initialized.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> is meant for process start-up work and not complex
    game-state logic, you should do the minimum work possible for your service to enter a ready
    state. Optimally the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> method should complete it's work
    in a single call.</li>

    <li>Use <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span> to clear all smart pointers, especially
    any references made to other system services. Holding a reference to another service beyond
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span> makes it very likely that you have a pointer to a
    service which is itself shutdown and thus all method calls on that service might be invalid.
    </li>

    <li>Any message subscriptions made by your service must be unsubscribed by the completion of
    the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span> method. Leaked message subscriptions can
    result in message handlers being invoked on your service after shutdown has completed which can
    result in crashes or unexpected behavior.</li>
    
    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span>,
    and <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span> methods are for process startup and shutdown.
    All game logic should occur during the running state (when <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTick
    </span> is being called). Consider using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">GameStateService</span>
    to control game logic during the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTick</span> state. See the
    BaseGame sample for an example of this.</li>

    <li>Classes implementing the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/efd/efd__ISystemService.htm">efd::ISystemService</a></span> methods should
    implement these methods as protected functions. These methods should never be called directly,
    they should only be called by the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/efd/efd__ServiceManager.htm">efd::ServiceManager</a></span> through the <span
    class="NDLSystemFont">efd::ISystemService</span> interface. The only potential exception to this
    recommendation would the the <span class="NDLSystemFont">efd::ISystemService::GetDisplayName
    </span> method which can be used for logging purposes.</li>

    <li>Attempt to create all system services at application startup time, even though the service
    may not be ready for operation right away (for example, if the app stays on a menu screen
    initially, so the simulation isn't running, but it has been created as a service). This allows
    for order of initialization and shutdown to be controlled by the service system. Even though
    the service is in a running state, it can still be logically paused.</li>

    <li>Prefer using <span class="NDLSystemFont">ServiceManager::Run()</span> over <span
    class="NDLSystemFont">ServiceManager::RunOnce()</span>. This will, however, require
    that the main application logic and flow of control be encoded within an application system
    service. Application initialization should be performed in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    OnInit</span> method of the application service, and application per-tick work should be
    performed in its <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTick</span> method. The advantage is that
    sophisticated support systems from Foundation will be available in all phases of the
    application. Examples include configuration, asset management, logging, and message handling. If
    this is not possible, calls to <span class="NDLSystemFont">RunOnce()</span> can be inserted into
    the application main loop, but initialization capabilities will be much more limited.</li>

    <li>Dynamically allocate a system service. Static initialization time can be a confusing and
    error prone microcosm, even when using the static data manager.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Entities, Rapid Iteration and System Services</h2>

<p>Many system services will interact with specific entity models. For example, a light service
might need to know about any entities that represent light sources or a pathing service might need
to know about entities that provide cover or obstruct movement. The most efficient way to perform
these interactions is to use built-in model implementations, but normal models can also be
discovered and changes to those models can be detected. Even data that normally isn't expected to
change can also change during rapid iteration.</p>

<p>Some best practices for services that interact with entities:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use one or more built-in models that are specific to your service. These models can
    automatically register with your service when they are created.</li>

    <li>Services registering built-in model factories should register a dependency on the <span
    class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/egf/egf__FlatModelManager.htm">
    egf::FlatModelManager</a></span> during their <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span> call.
    </li>
    
    <li>Queue expensive work and perform it during your <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTick</span>.
    Doing expensive work directly in response to entity property changes, for example, can lead to
    wasted effort as the property might change multiple times or closely related properties might
    change separately and in any order.</li>

    <li>During rapid iteration properties might change in ways that would normally not be possible
    given the current run-time state of the game. While it is important not to crash when faced
    with errant data it is also not a good idea to add complex logic to your system service in
    order to handle edge cases that only occur during rapid iteration. Instead consider responding
    to the '<span class="NDLSystemFont">kMSGID_SchedulerCleared</span>' notification which is sent
    in response to the Toolbench 'Reset Game' command and doing a thorough reset of your internal
    entity-related state. See the BaseGame tutorial for an example of this.</li>

    <li>Establish clear ownership of shared objects, particularly with respect to resource
    allocation and destruction. This is of particular concern for objects pointed to by both
    built-in models and system services. The system service typically must free resources
    during <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span>, while entities and their models
    typically release resources during entity destruction, which occurs when the Entity Manager
    shuts downs. It is hard to gaurantee the ordering of such events such that the shared
    resource is always released yet never before its final use. Smart pointers can alleviate
    some of these problems: use smart pointers for the resource in both the service and the
    built-in. Otherwise, register built-ins with the system service and clear their resources
    when the service shuts down.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Parallelism and System Services</h2>

<p>Modern PCs and consoles need to be able to run multiple threads within a single process or
address space. It allows them to easily share data structures and allow asynchronous and better
response to external systems, as well as the obvious benefit of better performance by utilizing
multiple processors or cores.</p>

<p>Some best practices for simplifying this challenge:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Make shared data structures read-only to avoid any synchronization overhead.</li>

    <li>Consider replicating shared data structures and develop a synchronization mechanism based
    on message passing (possibly based on shared memory). Further, consider the single-writer
    approach to avoid race conditions caused by intermingled read/modify/write sequences. This
    approach is suitable for communicating between distributed processes or threads in separate
    address spaces.</li>

    <li>Avoid parallelism between system services. Have only one System Service Manager in the
    application, and consider it the "main thread", making the main loop single threaded. Insulate
    parallelism for a system service so that external interactions with that service are single
    threaded. For example, if path finding is on a background thread, do all synchronization on a
    shared data structure within the path finding service. Multiple parallel services should avoid
    coordinating with each other. This localizes all synchronization for one service within that
    service alone.</li>
</ul>
