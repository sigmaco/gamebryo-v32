<h1>Deleting a system service</h1>

<p>You might find that you need to delete a system service you have created at runtime before
Service Manager shuts down. Service are unregistered automatically by the Service Manager before
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ServiceManager::Run</span> returns, and their reference count is
decremented. However if you need to remove or delete a system service before then you can do so
manually.</p>

<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">To delete a system service</p>

<ol>
    <li>Call <span class="NDLSystemFont">ServiceManager::UnregisterSystemService</span>. This will
    cause the service to transition to the shutting down state and <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    OnShutdown</span> will be called by Service Manager once per tick until it returns <span
    class="NDLSystemFont">efd::AsyncResult_Complete</span>. Once <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    OnShutdown</span> has completed, the system service will be removed and Service Manager will
    release the reference count that it holds for that system service.

<pre>
SmartPointer&lt;MySystemService&gt; spMySystemService = m_pServiceManager-&gt;GetSystemServiceAs&lt;MySystemService&gt;();
m_pServiceManager-&gt;UnregisterSystemService(spMySystemService);
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>If multiple services are unregistered at the same time, these services will be shut down
    sequentially based on their reverse dependency order just as they would during normal
    application shutdown. However, unlike during normal shutdown, <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTick
    </span> will not be called on unregistered services that are blocked waiting on other services
    to shutdown.</li>

    <li>Some number of ticks later after <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span> has returned
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">efd::AsyncResult_Complete</span> the reference held by Service
    Manager will be released. To make sure the service actually gets destructed you must release
    all references for the service. Typically all resources should be released during <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span> so it normally has little memory cost if service references
    persist after the unregistration of that service, but if the cached service reference is used
    after it's destruction is completed it could result in an application crash.</li>

    <li></li>

    <li>When services are added or removed at run-time the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit
    </span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTick</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown
    </span> orders for all services will be recomputed to account for the addition or removal of
    new service dependencies.</li>

    <li>If a service is unregistered at run-time but another service has a required dependency on
    the removed service it will generate a critical error that will lead to process shutdown.</li>

    <li>Once a service is unregistered by calling <span class="NDLSystemFont">
    ServiceManager::UnregisterService</span>, it will immediate become unavailable for lookup via
    the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ServiceManager::GetSystemServiceAs</span> method.</li>

    <li>Additionally, a new instance of the service can be registered immediately following the
    unregister call even through the previous instance of the service will not have completed
    shutdown yet. While this is supported it is not recommended as some services may manage shared
    system resources so this could lead to unexpected failures.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyone else holding a reference to your system service will prevent the destructor from being
called. Be care removing system services that other system services might depend on as there is no
mechanism for notification of when a system syrvice is removed at runtime. Many system services grab
a reference to any services they depend on in their <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnPreInit</span> or
<span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> methods and hold that reference until their <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span> method. As a result, it is recommended that services which are
added or removed dynamically at run-time should not have references cached in other services unless
those services have an application specific mechanism for knowing when the service is added or
removed so that the references can be released.</p>
