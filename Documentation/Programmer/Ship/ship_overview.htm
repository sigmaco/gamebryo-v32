<h1>Overview of Shipping Your Game</h1>

<a name="UseShippingConfiguration" id="UseShippingConfiguration"></a><h3>Use the Shipping build configuration</h3>

<p>Using the Shipping build configuration instead of Release has a number of benefits. It disables
internal uses of some APIs and tools that cannot or should not be used in a shipped title, such as
TTY or OutputDebugString output calls. Logging, memory diagnostics (including extra padding and
runtime checks), and asserts are disabled as well.</p>

<a name="LockShaderCache" id="LockShaderCache"></a><h3>Pre-populate shader caches</h3>

<p>NiFragmentMaterial based materials store a .cache file that contains all shaders that have been
produced by the material. The material will first check to see if the desired shader is located in
the cache when attempting to create a new shader. If it is in the cache, the material can avoid
generating shader code and compiling it by simply loading the compiled shader from the cache.</p>

<p>Titles which make use of a NiFragmentMaterial based material (e.g., NiStandardMaterial) should
pre-populate the shader caches with all possible shaders that may be encountered. This can be done
manually by running around in the world and performing game actions during development or QA, or in
a semi-automated method that loads and renders every asset in the game under various lighting
conditions (e.g., 0-2 directional lights x 0-2 point lights).</p>

<p>The pre-populated caches should be shipped with the title, and the caches put into lock-down via
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFragmentMaterial::SetDefaultLockProgramCache(true)</span>. Calling
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SetDefaultLockProgramCache(true)</span> will prevent any additional shaders
from being entered into the cache. On the PC, there will be a separate cache for each shader model
target, so be sure to run and generate shaders for the full range of hardware the title is intended to run on.</p>

<p>The next section discusses how to handle the case where a combination was missed when the cache
is locked down.</p>

<a name="ReplaceShader" id="ReplaceShader"></a> <a name="ReplaceErrorShader" id=
"ReplaceErrorShader"></a><h3>Understand replacement shaders and the error shader</h3>

<p>On some platforms it may not be possible for a shipped title to write to the shader cache.
Additionally, it may not be possible to compile a shader in a shipped title. In these cases if the a
desired shader is not found in the shader cache, then there is no way for the title to produce the
desired shader. This typically results in the title rendering the object with the error shader. To
prevent the need to use the error shader in a shipping title, replacement shaders were
introduced.</p>

<p>All NiFragmentMaterial base materials shipped with Gamebryo support replacement shaders. When a
shader cache is produced for one of the Gamebryo NiFragmentMaterials, such as NiStandardMaterial,
the shader cache will be pre-populated with a set of very simplistic shaders that should always work.
If the shader cache is locked (meaning it not possible to add entries to the cache) and the desired
shader can not be found in the cache, then one of the replacement shaders will be used. While the
replacement shaders are very simplistic, generally only supporting one light and a base texture,
they provide a way to render an object without having to resort to the garish looking error
shader.</p>

<p>As stated above, support for using replacement shaders will automatically be enabled if the
material shader caches are locked. The material shader caches can be locked or unlocked via
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFragmentMaterial::SetDefaultLockProgramCache()</span>.</p>

<a name="AspectRatioAware" id="AspectRatioAware"></a><h3>Be aware of various common aspect ratios</h3>

<p>There are three common aspect ratios in wide use for PC and console games: 4:3, 16:9, and 16:10.
It does not take much effort during development to consider different aspect ratios and adjust the
camera accordingly, but forgetting to do so can have a negative impact on end user experience. For
all three consoles, the aspect ratios to be aware of are 16:9 and 4:3, while on the PC
theoretically almost any ratio is possible, but 4:3, 16:9, and 16:10 are the most common.</p>

<p>The PS3 renderer provides GetDisplayAspectRatio() which returns a float indicating
the aspect ratio.</p>

<a name="SafeZone" id="SafeZone"></a><h3>Render important User Interface elements in a safe zone</h3>

<p>Output devices on different platforms all lose some amount of output image data due to how the
image is cast to the display device. The amount of edge data lost can vary from almost none to on
the order of 10% of the visible width. While this may be generally ignored when presenting image
data to the screen, it causes significant loss when presenting text as is common on UI elements.
This problem, factored with widely varying resolutions across output devices led to a special "Safe
Zone" rendering implementation for all UI elements.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderer.htm">NiRenderer</a></span> class provides methods to obtain a
default safe zone rectangle for a given platform. See the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderer.htm#SafeZone">safe zone rendering</a> method reference for more
information.</p>

<p>Note: Although the safe zone was originally a physical issue due to the operation of a CRT, it
has been preserved into the era of digital TV and HDTV monitors because existing TV content
contains junk outside of what was the traditional safe zone region. It needs to be considered (and
is a TRC/TCR/Lotcheck issue) even for HD resolution console games.</p>

<a name="LongRunningTime" id="LongRunningTime"></a><h3>Reset the time base</h3>

<p>A number of systems throughout Gamebryo deal with absolute time in seconds since an epoch as a
single-precision floating point number. If a title is long running then precision issues can start
to occur as this time gets large (problems typically manifest as odd animation jerkiness).</p>

<p>The epoch can be reset to avoid these problems, which is done by calling <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">efd::SetInitialTimeInSec()</span>. Note: This must be done during a transition when
no animations are playing. When a player enters a menu, dies, or a new level is loaded are all
potentially good opportunities.</p>

<p>To maintain a granularity of at least half a milisecond, the longest time between resets should
be no greater than about 2^13 seconds (2^23 / 1000) or about 2 and 1/2 hours.</p>

<a name="BackgroundLoading" id="BackgroundLoading"></a><h3>Leverage background loading</h3>

<p>Why is background loading important?</p>

<ul>
    <li>A single byte access from a dual-layer DVD may take over a <b>second</b> just in seek time
    alone. If the spindle motor has spun down, the delay can be even greater. For this reason, any
    form of file access should always be constrained to a background thread or done asynchronously,
    no matter how much or little data is being read.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gamebryo provides a number of mechanisms to support loading content in the background:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStream</span> class has <a href=
    "../../Programmer/Object_Systems/Streaming.htm">built-in support</a> for <a href=
    "../../Programmer/General_Topics/BackgroundLoading.htm">background loading</a> of NIF
    assets.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Programmer/AssetRuntimeService/asset_load_loading.htm">AssetFactoryManager</a></span>
    class supports background loading of many asset types, provided they are present in an asset
    web. Additional asset loading factories can be easily created and registered to support
    background loading of custom files without having to rebuild the supporting infrastructure each
    time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Background loading threads, particularly the default NiStream background thread are created at a
lower priority than the main application thread. This means they may get starved on machines with a
single hardware thread or cooperative thread scheduling if the main thread does not Sleep or Yield
periodically.</p>

<h3>Minimize initial load times</h3>

<p>It is important to minimize the time until an animated loading screen is displayed (time to
first display flip), as the loading screen gives a visual indication that the title has not crashed
or hung. In addition, some consoles have specific maximum times as a certification requirement.</p>

<p>The first displayed 'loading screen' may not mention loading at all. Loading can be occurring
during the display of required legal text or logos as well.</p>

<p>How to keep this time to a minimum:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Load only what is needed to display the loading screen (likely just shaders and a font or
    logo screen)</li>

    <li>Get a render loop up and running, displaying the loading screen</li>

    <li>Load the rest of the content to get to the menu or level in the background (or in a
    timeboxed manner on the foreground thread).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Avoid hitches due to loading</h3>

<p>Some consoles have specific maximum times between flips (minimum frame rates) as a certification
requirement. This serves both to ensure a minimum acceptable performance and because the console
on-screen-displays (guide, XMB, etc...) are co-operatively dependent on the title, relying on flips
in order to have a chance to get displayed.</p>

<p>Games using the AssetWeb will need to be sure and set PreloadGraphs in their config.ini
to be true. By default this is the case, but what that flag will do is cause all of the *.nt
files in their asset-web-metadata folder to be loaded at the start of their game, instead of
loading on demand when a never before seen asset tag is used in an asset lookup.</p>

<p>File accesses are a very common cause of avoidable frame rate issues.</p>

<p>By performing all loading in the background and continuing to flip during a render loop on the
foreground, hitches can typically be avoided, both during gameplay and in loading between or before
gameplay. However, some types of resources need to acquire the renderer lock in order to allocate
memory from or upload data to the GPU, and this can cause a hitch if the background thread kicks in
just before the foreground thread begins rendering the frame.</p>
