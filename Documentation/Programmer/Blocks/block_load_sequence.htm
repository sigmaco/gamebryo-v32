<h1>Block Loading Sequence</h1>

<p>The Game Framework transitions through a sequence of steps when it loads a block file. The
sequence is the same whether you use the "InitialWorld" configuration option from the samples or if
you load your world programmatically by using the Entity Loader Service (<span class=
"NDLSystemtFont"><a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_entity_loader_svc.htm">
egf::EntityLoaderService</a></span>). Further the timing changes slightly based on whether the
"auto-enter world" feature, which causes created entities to immediately enter the world when the
block is loaded, is enabled. It is recommended that auto-enter world not be used as this gives the
game more control over when the set of entities created in the block become visible. See <a href=
"../Entities/entity_world_state.htm">Entity In/Out of World State</a> for more details on this
feature.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>The following are the steps taken during block file load:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The block file is loaded by the Entity Loader Service.

        <p class="indent1">The Entity Loader Service is responsible for locating and loading the
        block file. At game startup, this can be accomplished by setting the "Game.InitialWorld"
        configuration setting. You can also request a block load by calling the <span class=
        "NDLSystemFont">EntityLoaderService::RequestEntitySetLoad</span>, passing in the asset ID
        of the block file that you want to load. If a notification of the load result is required,
        pass a callback category to this method. The callback category is used to send the <span
        class="NDLSystemFont">egf::EntityLoadResult</span> message, indicating the result of the
        load request.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Flat model files are located for entities in the block.

        <p class="indent1">Each entity that is specified in the block file has an associated flat
        model file. During loading of the block file it is pre-parsed and each referenced flat model
        is located before the entities are instantiated. This work happens in the <span class=
        "NDLSystemtFont"><a href="../../Reference/efd/efd__AssetFactoryManager.htm">
        AssetFactoryManager</a></span> and will be performed on the background thread when
        background loading in enabled.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Entities are instantiated and added to the EntityManager (<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a
        href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_entity_mgr.htm">egf::EntityManager</a>
        </span>).

        <p class="indent1">Each entity in the block file is instantiated using flat model files
        located above. If any of the underlying flat model files is missing or cannot be located,
        the world file load fails and an error message written to the log file.</p>

        <p class="indent1">Each of the entity's properties are set to their initial values here. If
        the entity has any built-in models, they are also created and initialized.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Once all entities in the block file have been allocated an <a href=
        "../../Reference/egf/egf__EntityLoadResult.htm">egf::EntityLoadResult</a> message is sent.

        <p class="indent1">An <span class="NDLSystemFont">egf::EntityLoadResult</span>(with the
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">elr_Loaded</span> result value) message is
        sent to the callback category provided in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">
        EntityLoaderService::RequestEntitySetLoad</span> call. This messages indicates that the 
        block file was found and parsed successfully and all the entities in the block file were
        allocated, but may not be initialized and ready for use yet.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnCreate</span> <a href=
        "../Behaviors/behavior_reference.htm">lifecycle behavior</a> is called on entities with this
        behavior.

        <p class="indent1">After the entity is instantiated, it is added to the EntityManager. If
        the model defines the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnCreate</span> behavior, the behavior is
        scheduled to execute on the next tick.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Entities begin preloading assets.

        <p class="indent1">Some entities may not be valid until certain assets are loaded. An entity
        indicates this by including the <a href=
        "../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Preloadable.htm">Preloadable</a>
        mix-in and setting the PreloadAssets property to TRUE before the end of the <span class=
        "NDLSystemFont">OnCreate</span> lifecycle behavior.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The Game Framework waits for any required assets that are requested by each entity.

        <p class="indent1">The Game Framework now waits for any required assets to load. The entity
        is not considered complete until all of its required assets have completed loading. If an
        asset cannot be found or is not loadable for other reasons, the preloading service should
        continue loading assets. Preloading is considered a "best effort" service, and entity
        construction should not be delayed because of errors in preloading.</p>
        
        <table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
            <tr align="left">
                <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD">
                    <p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>

                    <div class="NDLNote">
                        Since asset preloading is asynchronous, it is possible for the underlying
                        entity asset property to change before preload completes. The preloading
                        system does not detect these changes, and as a result you might preload
                        assets defined by the previous property value. If you have entity asset
                        properties that change at runtime, you should ensure the resulting preloaded
                        asset matches the current property value.

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </li>

    <li>Once all required assets are loaded, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnAssetsLoaded</span>
        <a href="../Behaviors/behavior_reference.htm">lifecycle behavior</a> is called.

        <p class="indent1">The <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnAssetsLoaded</span> lifecycle behavior
        is called on entities once all assets are preloaded. This behavior is called for all
        entities, even if the entity did not request preloading (by not mixing in Preloadable or by
        setting PreloadAssets to FALSE).</p>
    </li>

    <li>After all the entity's assets are loaded, an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
        "../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_entity_mgr.htm">OwnedEntityAdded</a></span>
        message is sent.

        <p class="indent1">The <span class="NDLSystemFont">OwnedEntityAdded</span> (<span class=
        "NDLSystemFont">efd::kMSGID_OwnedEntityAdded</span>) message indicates the entity has
        completed loading and is available for scheduling. This message is sent to the local message
        category (<span class="NDLSystemFont">kCAT_LocalMessage</span>).</p>
    </li>

    <li>If auto-enter world was selected, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnEnterWorld</span>
        <a href="../Behaviors/behavior_reference.htm">lifecycle behavior</a> is called.

        <p class="indent1">If auto-enter world was specified either when this block was loaded or as
        option was not specified but the global default for auto-enter is in effect, then as soon as
        the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnAssetsLoaded</span> lifecycle behavior completes the
        entity will enter the world. Entities do not render or simulate physics when they are not
        in the world, but they may still run most behaviors.</p>

        <p class="indent1">An <span class="NDLSystemFont">OwnedEntityEnterWorldMessage</span> (<span
        class="NDLSystemFont">egf::kMSGID_OwnedEntityEnterWorld</span>) message is sent to the local
        message category (<span class="NDLSystemFont">kCAT_LocalMessage</span>) when this lifecycle
        completes.</p>
    </li>
    

    <li>Once all entities in the block are loaded the <span class="NDLSystemFont">
        OnEntitySetFinished</span> <a href="../Behaviors/behavior_reference.htm">lifecycle
        behavior</a> is called.

        <p class="indent1">The <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnEntitySetFinished</span> lifecycle
        behavior is called after all the entities in the block are completely initialized. If
        auto-enter world is active, that means once all <span class="NDLSystemFont">
        OwnedEntityEnterWorldMessage</span> messages are received, and if auto-enter world is not
        active that means once all <span class="NDLSystemFont">OwnedEntityAdded</span> messages
        have been received.</p>

        <p class="indent1">It is worth mentioning that the <span class="NDLSystemFont">
        OnEntitySetFinished</span> lifecycle behavior is also called in this same order for entities
        not loaded from a block.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Once all entities in the block file are loaded an <a href=
        "../../Reference/egf/egf__EntityLoadResult.htm">egf::EntityLoadResult</a> message is sent.

        <p class="indent1">An <span class="NDLSystemFont">egf::EntityLoadResult</span> message
        (with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">elr_EntityCreationCompleted</span> result value) is
        sent to the callback category provided in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">
        EntityLoaderService::RequestEntitySetLoad</span> call. This messages indicates that all the
        entities in the block file are now loaded.</p>
