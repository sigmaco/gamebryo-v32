<h1>Best practices for working with models</h1>

<ul>
    <li>It is valuable to consider 4 conceptual tiers of models that would be realized by policy:

        <ul>
            <li>Interface models that contain only abstract behaviors. These declare a ways that an
            entity can be interacted with, and what capabilities the entity contracts to
            provide.</li>

            <li>Elemental models that are mixed in to several classes of models. These are
            recomposable entity components and would be implemented in a very general purpose
            way.</li>

            <li>Concrete class models that mix-in elemental models but are not instantiated. These
            could be tweaked to include specialized behaviors where the whole needs to be greater
            than the sum of its mixed in parts.</li>

            <li>Template models (called presets) that further refine class models and are
            instantiable leafs. These would not have new behaviors or properties, but could have
            new initial property values.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>To help highlight this structure, you should use adjectives to name the interface and
    elemental mix-in models (Destructible, Visible, CanAttack) and nouns for the class and template
    models (Creature, Building, BlueDragon).</li>

    <li>Commonly all properties and behaviors will to belong in the elemental mix-in models. If
    tempted to hang new properties at more derived levels, consider that representing it as a new
    elemental mix-in might allow for future reuse/modding. Concrete class and preset template
    models frequently override values but do not add new ones.</li>

    <li>It is often a good idea to avoid models that are both instantiated and mixed in. If the
    version that gets instantiated needs to be tuned in the future, it will be easier if it is not
    also mixed into further specialized models. For example, a non-instantiated "Dragon" model
    should be a mixed into an instantiated "DragonDefault" model. Later, it would be easy to add
    variants like "DragonGreat" as a peer to "DragonDefault". One approach would be to make
    DragonDefault a Preset.</li>

    <li>Often a designer will want to try out an entity instance in-game and tweak its settings.
    The final settings make the most sense when copied back to EMT or the world builder model
    palette as a preset.</li>

    <li>Try to name models to take advantage of sorting such that all template models appear
    together, along with any associated class model mixed in. This is particularly helpful in the
    spreadsheet view when editing properties. You can also make use of folder organization in the
    model browser, which is based on tags.</li>

    <li>When considering composition of new entity types, the first approach to consider is mixing
    of models. If the composition needs to change during gameplay, you must use multiple entities
    and hold entity references in a Property.</li>

    <li>For models that assume they will be mixed into a particular type of entity (for example,
    one that has a Position property), the designer can choose among a few approaches. They could
    mix in the Positionable model to gain access to the Position property. Or they could declare
    their own Position property directly in the model, and rely on the mix-in resolution system to
    provide only a single copy of that property. The second approach supports models that are
    entirely independently developed (to the point of having no common parent models) and is still
    able to mix them together effectively. It is possible, but not recommended, to access
    properties in a behavior that are not declared to be part of (or mixed into) the current
    model.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>This is a quick introduction to some object-oriented software terminology used to describe
associations or relationships between pieces of the virtual world. These have been gleaned from
several sources, and "tuned".</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mix-in: is used for Composition, Extends, and Interface.</li>

    <li>Extends, inherits: is-a, is-like-a, adds-to</li>

    <li>Interface: can-be-used-as-a</li>

    <li>Composition: is-made-of-a (whole-part with single owner and identical lifetimes).</li>

    <li>Aggregation (shareable): has-a (whole-part with multiple owners, or separate
    lifetimes)</li>

    <li>Refers: uses-a</li>

    <li>Contains: contains-a, carries, collects (implies hiding it; not adding to own I/F; implies
    single-owner; implies separate lifetimes)</li>

    <li>EntityRef Property type: is used for Aggregation, Refers, Contains</li>

    <li>Behavior: acts-on, tells, tells-a-thing-to-do-something</li>
</ul>

<p>When discussing these concepts it is helpful to use the terms inner and outer to refer to the
pieces. The piece that makes the reference is outer, and the piece being referenced is the inner.
This doesn't always imply containment, or hiding or abstraction. When talking about pieces, they
might be Entities, Properties, Models, or possibly groups.</p>

<h2>Decomposition</h2>

<p>A realistic game is generally too complex to represent as a single game object, so the developer
must decompose the system into multiple models. Further, it is clearly unacceptable to provide a
unique implementation for each game object instance. You will want to identify classes of objects
(Entities) that share the same capabilities, then create multiple instances of those classes, each
operating independently. In the Gamebryo Game Framework, the game objects are called Entities, and
the classes are called Models.</p>

<p>In the past two approaches have been tried and shown to <b>not</b> be scalable:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A single monolithic object type. In this approach, there is only one class of game object,
    and each object instance is configured, or initialized to down-select to the capabilities the
    designer desires. Perhaps through a set of check boxes.</li>

    <li>A fixed hierarchy of object types. This approach is more object oriented, but suffers from
    the multiple inheritance "diamond of death", and inflexibility to changes in the design.</li>
</ul>

<p>It has long been considered optimal to use a component-oriented approach to modeling game
objects. The idea here is to independently implement many small pieces of functionality, and glue
them together in a separate step to realize the different capabilities desired for different
classes of objects. The key benefit of this approach is that not all entities contain everything,
so it saves space and complexity.</p>

<p>The Emergent mix-in system is a generalization of these approaches allowing a designer to choose
the most appropriate approach. Gamebryo Entities are component-oriented, and also allow
hierarchical classes of Models. Mix-ins provide manageable reuse and object oriented interface and
specialization capabilities, but also give us the combinatorial richness of composition. In some
cases, mixing two Models implies specialization. In other cases it implies composition. The
designer is free to choose.</p>

<p>When a designer decomposes their world, they must identify which pieces will be represented as
an Entity. Some parts of the world will be completely static, and can be baked into the constant
terrain. During edit time, we can think of those objects as Entities that can be created and placed
in the world. But they have no behaviors, and could be optimized away at runtime.</p>

<p>Other parts will be stationary, but will be able to change state. E.g. a tree may be whole or
burned. That object will be a real Entity instance at run time. Since there will potentially be
many tree Entities, the designer will create a Tree Model from which each tree is instantiated. By
changing the default values stored in the Tree Model, all trees can be tuned.</p>

<p>One of the most important Properties of a Tree Model is its graphical representation (mesh,
texture...). The asset ID for its chosen asset could be stored in an mAppearance Property. All
trees that look the same will have the same default value for mAppearance. If a different species
of tree is desired, a new Model or Preset would is created with a different visual asset in its
mAppearance Property. A tree would not have a default position, but may have other such Properties
(e.g. mHeight, mLumberContent, mIsBurned,...).</p>

<p>When creating a level, or a world, the tree Models and Presets would be used to scatter initial
Entity instances around the world. During run time, each of these trees would be an Entity, and
each could be individually burned or harvested.</p>

<p>Entities, Properties and Models can be used to represent much more complex objects, both
tangible and abstract, such as NPCs, quests, inventory, popularity, chi, etc. The designer will
determine which things to represent, which things to ignore, and how best to structure the
complexity of the system they envision.</p>

<h2>Organization and Reuse</h2>

<p>One way an object oriented Entity system helps manage complexity is with reuse. Easily and
quickly extending or overriding the capability of existing objects is a powerful and efficient
approach. Manageable reuse is realized with the sub-classing of Models.</p>

<p>The Entity system is not tied to any particular language. It can indeed support multiple
languages concurrently. It is purposely not tied to one of the more limited and strict object
models in a particular scripting language. Therefore the Mix-in Model system is provided in the
game framework and mapped only to simpler scripting concepts. In this way, the same entity and
model semantics are preserved no matter which language or languages are chosen.</p>

<p>The mix-in system avoids the difficulties of multiple inheritance by automatically resolving
identical members from multiple base classes (making them identical). It supports data-driven
definitions so new game object classes can be constructed using composition, that wind up having a
combination of capabilities without resorting to writing code.</p>

<p>A consequence of the approach is that a great deal more content can be constructed in a short
period of time, because a Model can be reused in unanticipated contexts. For example, a fire-attack
might be used by a dragon and by a flame-thrower, and spontaneous human combustion. Debugging or
extending the capability in one place upgrades the capability everywhere that class was mixed
in.</p>

<p>When creating the world, known as a "block" file in Toolbench, you will likely want to override
properties of your base models. Rather than overriding each property of that base model in the
block file, it is best to create presets and to put those presets into the block file instead. This
technique will minimize the overrides contained in the block file to just those that are unique to
the specific entity.</p>
