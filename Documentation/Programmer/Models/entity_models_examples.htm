<h1>Model examples</h1>

<p>This section provides several examples of different entity models you can create and mix
together to define your Entities.</p>

<h2>Composing models</h2>

<p>Individual models are used to capture the properties and behaviors for a known type of entity.
The Entity Modeling Tool (EMT) has a set of pre-built models you can combine to create more
interesting and specialized models for your application. Each individual model defines a set of
properties and behaviors common to all entities based on that model. EMT lets you define default
values for all properties associated with a model.</p>

<p>There is little runtime overhead for default properties, regardless of the number of active
entities in the world. The properties use copy-on-write semantics to share a single common instance
of default properties. A new property instance is created at runtime only when the property is
changed from the default. All entities having the default value for a property point to the one in
the Model, which is shared across all entities of that model.</p>

<p>Each model can have a set of Behaviors. When composing models by mix-in, your final entity
responds to events that match these Behaviors in a model-specific way. For example, Rocks don't
have a damage model so they do not mix-in a damage model. A statue might have a CrumbleDamage model
so it can fall to pieces when attacked.</p>

<h2>Creating a palette of reusable models</h2>

<p>A designer can take advantage of composability to construct many types of entities from a much
smaller set of carefully designed models. For example, rocks cannot be damaged if they have no
damage model but a Statue has a CrumbleDamage model, so it falls to pieces when attacked. A
fire-attack might be used by a dragon, by a flame-thrower, and by spontaneous human combustion.
Debugging or extending the capability in one place upgrades the capability everywhere that class
was mixed in.</p>

<p>Using EMT, you can quickly create a palette of reusable models that you can then use as building
blocks for your application. By creating a set of common models, you're defining the runtime design
of your application. This gives your designers the flexibility to be creative but within the
constraints of the overall themes and goals of the application.</p>

<p>Here are some representative samples of the families of models you can create.</p>

            <td>Bi-Ped, Quadra-ped, Wheeled</td>

</table>

<h3>Examples of composed models</h3>

<p>By creating a well-defined set of base models, you can design more complex models by mix-in.
Some examples of such composed models might be:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Composed model</th>

            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Fire breathing cow</td>

            <td>mix-in a visual, attack, and damage model.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Walking bear</td>

            <td>mix-in a visual, AI, and motion model.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Stone dragon that cannot be cut, but will crumble</td>

            <td>mix in a visual and damage model</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Runtime composition</h3>

<p>A very different kind of composability is one that can be changed at run time. This is
accomplished by having a character contain a set of other entities that provide additional
capabilities. The container would delegate actions to the dynamically composed entities to achieve
incrementally more abilities. This kind of composability would require more work to develop and
tune, and would consume more runtime resources. But for some kinds of games it is required for
character development or expansion packs.</p>

<h2>Composition Examples</h2>

<h3>A fire-breathing bear.</h3>

<p>We want to add a dangerous fire-breathing bear to our game. The bear model is a composition of
an Actor, which is an mobile entity in our world, and FireBreath that defines what it means for an
entity to breath fire.</p>

<h4>Use a base model for all Actors</h4>

<p>The Emergent Standard Model Library contains a model that represents an animated entity in the
scene called <em>Actor</em>. An actor is an entity model that represent an entity with a set of
animation sequences. We compose the Actor out of a Renderable that defines visibility, Shadowable
that defines whether the actor can cast or receive shadows, and a BaseEntity model that defines
virtual functions common to all entities.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/Actor.png" width="429" height="411" alt="Actor (20K)">
</div>

<h4>Create a Bear actor model</h4>

<p>Now we define our bear model. The Bear model mixes in the Actor model. We want to identify which
animation to play when the bear is at rest and when it is moving. We extend our Actor model and add
two new properties to define these animations. Alternatively we could model these animations as a
single property that changes at runtime depending on the state of our bear.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/BearModel.png" width="201" height="385" alt="BearModel (10K)">
</div>

<h4>Define a Fire breath attack model</h4>

<p>We don't want just any bear, we want a fire-breathing bear. To accomplish this we create another
model that represent a fire-breath attack. This mixes in fire damage (with a damage duration and a
damage amount) and fire particles for display (with particle range, falloff, cone diameter, and
speed). We override the default particle information to provide reasonable default values for these
properties.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/FireBreathModel.png" width="308" height="390" alt="FireBreathModel (14K)">
</div>

<p align="center"><img src="FireBreathModel.png"></p>

<h4>Create our FireBreathingBear model</h4>

<p>Now we combine the non-fire breathing bear model with the fire breath attack model to create our
fire-breathing bear. We override the default damage and increase it to 225 to indicate this is a
powerful attack. We also override the particle range and reduce it from 20 to 10 to indicate our
fire-breathing bear can't breath as far as, say, a dragon. We override the default 'DamageTarget'
behavior to play the appropriate animation when our bear attacks and to apply damage to any entity
within range.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/FireBreathingBearFull.png" width="536" height="519" alt=
    "FireBreathingBearFull (32K)">
</div>

<p>There is still work to do with our FireBreathingBear. We have to define the position where the
fire-breath attack originates. These values are updated as we move around the scene; we can do this
either in script as part of handling entity movement or as a built-in property model that is
updated by a controlling entity. We need to identify any enemies that are in range of the attack.
We need a way to indicate the attack is complete and update the state of our bear(s)
appropriately.</p>

<p>The full object model for our Fire breathing bear might look like this:</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/FireBreathingBearFull.png" width="536" height="519" alt=
    "FireBreathingBearFull (32K)">
</div>

<h3>Fire-breathing bear revisited</h3>

<p>A different approach would be to design the Bear to have a collection of spells.</p>

<h4>Define a Spell model</h4>

<p>Each spell would be implemented as a separate Model (for example FireSpellModel).</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/FireSpell.png" width="349" height="319" alt="FireSpell (14K)">
</div>

<h4>Create a magic user model</h4>

<p>When the magic user "learns" the fire spell an instance of the fire spell entity is created and
added to the entity's spell list, which is a collection of EntityIDs. The magic user model.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/MagicUser.png" width="122" height="85" alt="MagicUser (2K)">
</div>

<h4>Mix-in the magic user model with the bear model</h4>

<p>We create a magic-using bear by mixing in the magic user model with the bear model. Since all
spell entities have the same BaseSpell model, the bear (or more generally the magic user) would
call the CastSpell Behavior of the desired spell enitity. The spell entity would contain spell
effects, and could reach back and modify the bear to subtract mana.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/MagicUsingBear.png" width="276" height="265" alt="MagicUsingBear (9K)">
</div>

<p>The full object model for our magic-using bear might look like this:</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/MagicUsingBearFull.png" width="617" height="559" alt=
    "MagicUsingBearFull (35K)">
</div>

<h4>The shovel example</h4>

<p>A character has a backpack. He adds a shovel to his inventory, and the handle now shows sticking
out.</p>

<p>The AddToInventory behavior looks up the "backpack", and adds the Shovel's EntityId to the
inventory list. The AddToInventory behavior on the character or the backpack or the BeAdded
behavior on the shovel finds the most containing Entity. The behavior then calls a
SceneGraphService built-in (AttachSceneGraph), to add a shovel-handle bump to the character's
mesh.</p>

<p>The shovel-handle is relative to the biped, but the asset used to draw it is associated with the
Shovel object, so it is easier to add content to a game, and organize it.</p>

<h4>Trigger system example</h4>

<p>A concrete trigger model is composed of two models: a source and a response.</p>

<p>Various sources might be collision, level start, passage of time, entity destruction, and so
on.</p>

<p>Various responses might be spawn an entity, play a sound, activate remote triggers, property
change on a given entity, and so on.</p>

<p>By using the extends trait on the DoResponse behavior, any number of response models can be
mixed into a concrete trigger, and each response will run in turn when that behavior is
invoked.</p>

<p>Note that using composition like this allows entirely new types of entities to be composed out
of existing models without writing any more script.</p>
