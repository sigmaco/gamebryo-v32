<h1>Models overview</h1>

<ul>
    <li>An Entity Model has the following:

        <ul>
            <li>A title-wide unique Model name.</li>

            <li>A collection of Property descriptions: name, type, initial
            default value.</li>

            <li>A collection of Behaviors: name, location of code.</li>

            <li>A list of base Models that are mixed into the Model and the
            priority order used in resolving collisions between its
            children.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>A Model is an Entity class, and is required when creating an Entity.
    The Entity will contain a corresponding Property for each of the Model's
    Property descriptions initialized to the corresponding value from the
    Model. When a Property is read-only, all Entities of that type share one
    copy of the constant value. Properties are allocated and copied only when
    changed from their initial value. Built-in Models and any Properties they
    maintain are fully allocated when the Entity is created.</li>

    <li>A Behavior is a public method associated with a Model that is executed
    in response to an identically named Event arriving for a given Entity. The
    Behaviors on a Model can be written in multiple scripting languages.</li>

    <li>When mixing Models together, the derived Model contains the union of
    set of Properties and Behaviors from those Models. The designer can choose
    which child has higher priority. The initial value of a Property and the
    implementation of a Behavior is determined by the highest priority child
    that provides it. The Model itself always has a higher priority than any of
    its children to support overriding and extending.</li>

    <li>All Models derive from the Base Entity found in the Standard Model
    Library. It is an interface-type Model and declares the set of Behaviors
    that every Entity provides. For example: OnCreate is called when an Entity
    is first created.</li>

    <li>Another useful fundamental Model in the Standard Model Library is
    Nameable, which interacts with World Builder such that Entity instances can
    optionally have useful readable names.</li>

    <li>A Model can be implemented entirely in C++ or entirely data-driven
    using EMT. A C++ Model can choose to expose its C++ member variables and
    methods as Properties and Behaviors. Data-driven Models will mix properly
    with C++ Models, but there are restrictions enforced between multiple
    built-in models to avoid unresolvable conflicts.</li>

    <li>There are two main advantages of C++ Models. They can allocate many
    atomic properties and manage them with no memory overhead. A C++ Model can
    also work around Property Accessor virtual function calls by using a direct
    pointer to the C++ Property. System Services that need access to Entity
    Properties would find this approach highly efficient. However, anytime the
    Built-in Model updates a property in its own specific way, it is required
    to mark the property dirty by calling the SetPropertyDirty function on the
    entity, allowing the Game Framework to notify other systems of the change
    as if it had gone through a set-property mechanism.</li>

    <li>When an Entity is created, each of its C++ Models are immediately
    created and its Properties are set to the initial values declared in EMT
    and World Builder. It is common for a Game Module to provide a C++ Model
    that can be mixed into Entities that want the capability of that Game
    Module. The System Service in the Game Module is informed of each of these
    creations. It can then cache a reference and access the members of the C++
    Model instances directly as opposed to accessing Properties via the Entity
    system. In fact, it can allocate per-Entity Property data and store it
    itself externally to the Entity while still providing the Property get/set
    interface to avoid copying the data back and forth.</li>

    <li>The use of interfaces and polymorphism in Entity Models is valuable for
    incremental extension and specialization of game objects. Behaviors
    requests resolve at runtime based on their name (late binding) regardless
    of the type of the Entity it arrives at. This allows for new Entity types
    to be added to a game without changing existing content to be aware of the
    new work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Model</b> A data-driven description of a class of Entity from which
        many Entity instances are created and initialized. A Model is derived
        from other Models using a resolution mechanism called mix-in. A
        built-in, compiled Model is called a <b>Built-in Model</b>. A Model is
        made of Property Descriptions and Behaviors, and follows object
        oriented paradigms.

        <ul>
            <li><b>Entity Model</b> used to disambiguate between a
            <b><em>Graphical Model</em></b> and logical <b><em>Entity
            Model</em></b></li>

            <li><b>Flat Model</b> is a term used to refer to the result of
            resolving mix-in inheritance hierarchy, and can be thought of as
            the compiled version of a Model definition.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Property Declaration</b> A piece of a Model that defines the name,
    type, initial value, and traits used to create a run time Property on an
    Entity of that Model.</li>

    <li><b>Property</b> A object that holds a value determined by the execution
    of an Entity. The type and initial value of a Property is initially set
    based on the corresponding Property Description in its Entity's Model.
    Allocation of a Property is optimized to refer to the Model's initial value
    until it is changed (copy-on-write).</li>

    <li><b>Behavior Declaration</b> A piece of a Model that describes the name,
    type, traits, and location of a Behavior that can be executed at run
    time.</li>

    <li><b>Behavior</b> A piece of executable code identified by a Model that
    can be implemented in a scripting language or native code.</li>

    <li><b>Behavior Built-in</b> A C++ function that is registered with the
    Behavior system such that it can be called by another Behavior even across
    language boundaries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Behavior and Interaction</h2>

<p>Ideally, a Behavior which is always associated with a Model is the only
thing that can write to an Entity's Properties. This approach allows the use of
a very simple concurrency model called Communicating Sequential Processes, or
"the single-writer model". Therefore, in order for the actions of one Entity to
affect the state of another Entity, the first must tell the second to execute a
Behavior. This is called an interaction, and uses the "send behavior request"
mechanism. These requests are queued up on the target, and executed one at a
time according to scheduling rules. This approach is required to avoid race
conditions for parallel execution of Entities or when running them in a
distributed online game across multiple processes.</p>

<p>For ease of development, in a single process, Entities run single-threaded
so the concurrency mechanism does not involve preemption. However, when an
Entity blocks, other Entities can execute and change state. When the blocked
Entity executes again, state may be different than when it blocked.</p>
