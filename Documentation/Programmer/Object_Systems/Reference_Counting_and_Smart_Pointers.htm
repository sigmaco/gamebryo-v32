<h1>Reference Counting and Smart Pointers</h1>

<p>All Gamebryo objects that are subclasses of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRefObject.htm">NiRefObject</a></span> 
 are reference-counted. This means that the object has the ability to store 
 a count of the number of pointers that refer to it. Code that requires 
 long-term references to any such object must declare a reference, releasing 
 that reference when the code is finished with the object. Under 
 such a system, objects delete themselves when the last reference is released 
 (in other words, the reference count is zero). With manual reference counting systems, this can be somewhat tedious&mdash;Gamebryo alleviates this tedium  via the use of so-called "smart pointers".</p>

<p>Note that instances of reference counted types such 
 as <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRefObject.htm">NiRefObject</a></span> 
 subclasses <em>must</em> be allocated on the heap using new, rather than 
 as static objects or stack objects (local variables). This is necessary 
 because if the reference count of an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRefObject.htm">NiRefObject</a></span> 
 falls to zero, that object will be deleted&mdash;and deletion of stack or 
 static objects will generate memory faults and crashes.</p>

<h2>Smart Pointers</h2>

<p>Reference counting is made semi-automatic in Gamebryo 
 through the use of smart pointers. These are implemented via <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPointer</span>; 
 a template class that has overloaded operators that make instances of 
 the type appear to act as standard pointers. However, smart pointers automatically 
 increment and decrement the reference counts of objects to which they 
 point, making it unnecessary for applications to ever call the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRefObject.htm">NiRefObject</a></span> 
 reference count functions directly. For example, if a smart pointer object 
 is declared as a local variable in a function and the pointer is assigned 
 to point to an object A, then A's reference count will be incremented 
 at the time the assignment is made. When the function returns, the local 
 smart pointer will be destroyed (as it goes out of scope), and A's reference 
 count will be decremented by one.</p>

<p>By convention, every Gamebryo class that is derived 
 from <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRefObject.htm">NiRefObject</a></span> 
 has a convenience declaration of a smart pointer to that type, which is 
 the type name with "<span class="NDLSystemFont">Ptr</span>" 
 appended (<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNodePtr</span>, 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTriShapePtr</span>, and so on).</p>

<p>A simple example:</p>


<pre>
NiNodePtr spParent = &lt;some node&gt;;
NiNodePtr spChild = NiNew NiNode;  
// spChild points to new object. Reference count is 1.
 
spParent-&gt;AttachChild(spChild);  
// Reference count of object pointed to by spChild is now 
// 2, since NiNode objects use smart pointers to refer their
// children.
 
spParent-&gt;DetachChild(spChild);  
// Reference count of object pointed to by spChild decreases 
// to 1.
 
spChild = 0;  
// Reference count of object decreases to 0. Object is 
// deleted.
</pre>

<p>The notes below discuss issues to be aware of with smart 
 pointers.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Any application pointer 
 to an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRefObject.htm">NiRefObject</a></span>-derived 
 object that persists across calls to code that could eliminate a smart 
 pointer reference to the object should be a smart pointer. For example, 
 if you detach a child <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a></span> 
 from its parent <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span>, 
 and you do not want the child to be deleted when the parent removes its 
 smart pointer reference to the child, the pointer to the child in your 
 code should be a smart pointer.</li>
	
	<li>Cycles are possible 
 when using smart pointers. Therefore, it is extremely important to examine 
 scenarios where cycles could potentially occur when designing with smart 
 pointers. For example, take the following scene graph layout:</li>
</ul>

<pre class="indent1">
"Grand-Parent" NiNode
       |
"Parent" NiNode
       |
"Child" NiNode  -  NiTimeController that points to "Parent" NiNode
</pre>

<p>If the NiTimeController were to store a 
 smart pointer to the "Parent" NiNode, normal scene graph deletion 
 would not occur when the application released the "Grand-Parent" 
 NiNode. A cycle, or loop, has been formed between "Parent" and 
 "Child" through the time controller and the memory will never 
 be deleted. In this case, a designer should either not use a smart pointer 
 or should provide reasonable policy for how to attach the time controller 
 to prevent this scenario.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li><em>Never 
 </em>call <span class="NDLSystemFont">delete</span>
 on a smart pointer. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. This is the only major 
 behavior deviation between pointers to standard heap objects and smart 
 pointers to reference counted objects. Calling <span class="NDLSystemFont">delete</span> on a smart pointer 
 will, of course, cause the object to which the smart pointer points to 
 be deleted, no matter what its reference count might be. If an application 
 wishes to release a reference to an object that is pointed to by a smart 
 pointer (before that smart pointer is automatically destroyed by going 
 out of scope), it should assign <span class="NDLSystemFont">0</span> 
 to the pointer. This will ensure that the object to which the smart pointer 
 points will not be destroyed until the reference count falls to zero.</li>
	
	<li>Similarly, never call 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">delete</span> on a regular pointer 
 to an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRefObject.htm">NiRefObject</a></span>, 
 as it may also delete the object prematurely.</li>
	
	<li>In order to differentiate 
 between pointers and smart pointers, Gamebryo uses the '<span class="NDLSystemFont">pk</span>' prefix for regular pointers 
 to class objects (<em>for example,</em> <span class="NDLSystemFont">pkObject</span>), 
 and the '<span class="NDLSystemFont">sp</span>' prefix for 
 smart pointers (<em>for example,</em> <span class="NDLSystemFont">spObject</span>).</li>
	
	<li>As mentioned above 
 in the discussion of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRefObject.htm">NiRefObject</a></span><span class="NDLSystemFont">s</span>, a smart pointer should only 
 point to an object that was allocated dynamically on the heap. A smart 
 pointer should never point to an object that is on the stack (<em>in other words,</em> 
 a local variable). A smart pointer should never point to a statically 
 defined object.</li>
	
	<li>It is a common mistake 
 for new users to defensively use smart pointers throughout the codebase 
 and never use regular pointers. This can often manifest in performance 
 decrease when smart pointers are passed up and down the stack, incrementing 
 and decrementing the reference count as the stack frame changes. In most 
 cases, it is safe to simply pass regular pointers as function arguments, 
 since the calling context has a reference to the object. If needed, a 
 user can pass "const &amp;" smart pointer objects as arguments. 
 This will point out the assumption that the calling context has a smart 
 pointer reference to the object, but does not incur the overhead of the 
 stack frame incrementing and decrementing the reference count.</li>
	
	<li>If a function takes 
 a smart pointer as an argument, a regular pointer should not be passed 
 via that argument if there are no other smart pointer references to the 
 object. If you do so, the object to which the regular pointer points will 
 be destroyed. The problem is the following:
	
	<ul>
		
		<li>An object is dynamically 
 allocated to the regular pointer <span class="NDLSystemFont">pkObject</span>. 
 The object has a reference count of <span class="NDLSystemFont">0</span>.</li>
		
		<li>To pass <span class="NDLSystemFont">pkObject</span> through a smart 
 pointer input parameter, the compiler generates an implicit call to the 
 smart pointer constructor to convert <span class="NDLSystemFont">pkObject</span> 
 to a temporary smart pointer, increasing the object's reference count 
 to <span class="NDLSystemFont">1</span>.</li>
		
		<li>The temporary smart 
 pointer is copied into a local smart pointer in the scope of the called 
 function via a call to the smart pointer copy constructor, increasing 
 the object's reference count to <span class="NDLSystemFont">2</span>.</li>
		
		<li>When the called 
 function returns, the local smart pointer is destroyed, decreasing the 
 object's reference count to <span class="NDLSystemFont">1</span>.</li>
		
		<li>The temporary smart 
 pointer is then destroyed in the calling function, decreasing the object's 
 reference count to <span class="NDLSystemFont">0</span>, 
 which causes the object to be de-allocated.</li>
	</ul>
	
	</li>
	
	<li>Smart pointers are 
 not required when dealing with reference-counted objects. Smart pointers 
 are simply a convenience. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRefObject</span> 
 objects include the functions IncRefCount and <span class="NDLSystemFont">DecRefCount</span>, 
 which add and release references directly. The smart pointer system is 
 simply a wrapper around these calls. Applications can mix smart pointers 
 with manual reference count modification.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent1">This example assumes no optimization. The 
 compiler may optimize out the copy constructor call, but the end result 
 is the same.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>If a function returns 
 a smart pointer type, and there are no other smart pointer references 
 to the returned object, callers must not assign the return value directly 
 to a regular pointer, or the returned pointer may point to a destroyed 
 object. The reason for this is similar to the case just described, where 
 it is risky to pass a regular pointer as an argument to a function which 
 declares the argument as a smart pointer.</li>
</ul>
	
	<p class="indent1">Function prototype: </p>
	
	<p class="indent1"><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObjectPtr Func();</span></p>
	
	<p class="indent1">Safe call: </p>
	
	<p class="indent1"><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObjectPtr spReturned = Func();</span></p>
	
	<p class="indent1">Risky call: </p>
	
	<p class="indent1"><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObject* pkReturned = Func();</span></p>

<p>The smart pointer system provides a macro for defining a smart pointer type,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSmartPointer</span>(classname). An example is:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSmartPointer(NiNode);</span></p>

<p>The macro expands to</p>

<pre>
class NiNode;
typedef NiPointer&lt;NiNode&gt; NiNodePtr;
</pre>
