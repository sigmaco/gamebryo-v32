<h1>Static Data Management Internals</h1>

<p>Static data initialization is one of several actions 
 that must be taken once when a library is first loaded into memory. For 
 example, a library that contains a singleton manager object must have 
 that manager created once only when the application is initialized, and 
 deleted once only when the application shuts down. Gamebryo uses the Static 
 Data Management, or SDM, system to handle such actions.</p>

<h2>Adding SDM Functionality to a New Library</h2>

<p>SDM functionality is typically provided per-library, 
 so that actions are taken when the library is loaded into memory and static 
 objects are initialized by the runtime system.</p>

<p>Libraries that need static data functionality typically 
 define a class that will include all of the SDM functionality. For Gamebryo 
 libraries, the is named <span class="NDLSystemFont">[Library]SDM</span>, 
 such as <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMainSDM</span>.</p>

<p>The header file, say <span class="NDLSystemFont">NewLibrarySDM.h</span>, 
 contains code like this:</p>

<pre>
#include "NiStaticDataManager.h"
#include "NewLibraryLibType.h"
NiDeclareSDM(NewLibrary, NEWLIBRARY_ENTRY)
</pre>

<p>The header file <span class="NDLSystemFont">NewLibraryLibType.h</span> 
 defines the preprocessor symbol <span class="NDLSystemFont">NEWLIBRARY_ENTRY</span> 
 to set up DLL symbol export or import on Win32. The macro <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDeclareSDM</span> 
 declares a class named <span class="NDLSystemFont">NewLibrarySDM</span> 
 which contains a constructor and <span class="NDLSystemFont">Init</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">Shutdown</span> functions.</p>

<p>The header file <span class="NDLSystemFont">NewLibraryLibType.h</span> 
 is typically included by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NewLibraryLib.h</span> 
 header file which all applications would include to use the library. This 
 is why Gamebryo requires that the global header for any library be included 
 someplace before using that library.</p>

<p>The source file <span class="NDLSystemFont">NewLibraryLibType.cpp</span> 
 defines the constructor and <span class="NDLSystemFont">Init</span> and 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">Shutdown</span> functions for the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NewLibrarySDM</span> 
 class. First is the constructor, defined with the following macro:</p>

<p><span class="NDLCodeSystemFont">NiImplementSDMConstructor(NewLibrary, "NiMain NiFloodgate");</span></p>

<p>The first argument to the macro is the name of the library 
 we are working with, while the second is a space-separated list of other 
 library names on which this library depends. For example, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NewLibrary</span> 
 library uses code from <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMain</span> and <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiFloodgate</span>, and implicitly <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSystem</span>. 
 The list is used to identify a static initialization order that ensures 
 that every library is initialized after those that it depends on. Static 
 data initialization can therefore assume that the libraries it depends 
 upon are usable. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSystem</span> library 
 is an implicit dependency of every library, and should not be listed.</p>

<p>Libraries that might be dynamically loaded on Win32 
 then define the following macro:</p>

<pre>
#ifdef NEWLIBRARY_EXPORT
NiImplementDllMain(NewLibrary);
#endif // NEWLIBRARY_EXPORT
</pre> 

<p>The symbol <span class="NDLSystemFont">NEWLIBRARY_EXPORT</span> 
 will be defined in a project file to indicate that the library is being 
 compiled for a DLL. Use of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiImplementDllMain</span> 
 macro adds the code necessary to initialize the static data when the library 
 is dynamically loaded.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Init</span> and <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">Shutdown</span> functions must now be defined. These 
 do one-off actions necessary to prepare the library for use. A typical 
 function looks like this:</p>

<pre>
void NewLibrarySDM::Init()
{
    NiImplementSDMInitCheck();
    
    NewLibraryClass::_SDMInit();
 
    NiRegisterStream(NewLibraryClass);
}
 
void NiMainSDM::Shutdown()
{
    NiImplementSDMShutdownCheck();
    
    NiUnregisterStream(NewLibraryClass);
 
    NewLibraryClass::_SDMShutdown();
}
</pre>

<p>The macros to verify the correct SDM state should always 
 be included. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Init</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">Shutdown</span> 
 functions for the library call any class-specific initialization and shutdown 
 functions. Class-specific functions perform actions such as initializing 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFixedString</span> objects or filling memory 
 pools.</p>

<p>Classes that are streamed by <a href="Streaming_Internals.htm">Gamebryo's 
 streaming system</a> must be registered once before any NIF file 
 is loaded, and un-registered when no more streaming will be done. This 
 functionality is therefore included in the SDM functions.</p>

<p>Finally, an object of type <span class="NDLSystemFont">NewLibrarySDM</span> 
 must be declared somewhere such that it will appear in every application 
 that uses the library. In most cases, it is placed in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NewLibraryLib.h</span> 
 header file which is intended to be included by all applications using 
 the library:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">static NiMainSDM NiMainSDMObject;</span></p>

<p>Note that this assumes that the header file is protected 
 from multiple-inclusion and hence only one object will be created regardless 
 of how many files include the per-library header file. The declaration 
 may also be placed in some other header or source file that is sure to 
 be used by every application using the library. For example, the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMainSDM</span> static object is declared in <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiObject.cpp</span>.</p>
