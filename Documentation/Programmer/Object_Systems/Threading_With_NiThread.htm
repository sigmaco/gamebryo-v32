<h1>Threading With NiThread</h1>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThread.htm">NiThread</a></span> 
 provides a cross-platform interface for threading applications. While 
 future releases will provide enhanced interfaces for handling processor 
 affinity, thread control, and other threading features, the current version 
 of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThread.htm">NiThread</a></span> 
 provides excellent functionality for coding higher-level threading tasks. 
 Developers who are using <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThread.htm">NiThread</a></span> 
 should read this document for an introduction to the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThread.htm">NiThread</a></span> 
 interfaces and should also read the <a href="../../Programmer/General_Topics/Overview_!Programming_with_Threads.htm">Programming 
 with Threads section</a> which details some issues with threaded development.</p>

<h2>NiThreadProcedure</h2>

<p>At the core of any threading model you have a procedure 
 that is executed in its own execution context. With <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThread.htm">NiThread</a></span>, 
 this procedure is wrapped within the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThreadProcedure.htm">NiThreadProcedure</a></span> 
 object. Developers using <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThread.htm">NiThread</a></span> 
 should create a subclass of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThreadProcedure.htm">NiThreadProcedure</a></span> 
 that overrides the method <span class="NDLSystemFont">ThreadProcedure</span>. 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">ThreadProcedure</span> should perform all the 
 work for the thread, and the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThreadProcedure.htm">NiThreadProcedure</a></span> 
 subclass should have references to all the data that it needs for execution. 
 As an example, let's look at the subclass <span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadProcedure</span> 
 from <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span>:</p>

<pre>
class BackgroundLoadProcedure : public NiThreadProcedure
{
    public:
        BackgroundLoadProcedure(NiStream* pkStream)
        {
            m_pkStream = pkStream;
        }
        virtual unsigned int ThreadProcedure(NiThread* pkThread);
  NiStream* m_pkStream;
};
</pre>

<p>This small subclass overrides the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ThreadProcedure</span> 
 method and stores a reference to all the resources it needs. In this case, 
 the pointer to an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 is the only necessary resource. Looking at the overridden method shows 
 the following code:</p>

<pre>
unsigned int NiStream::BackgroundLoadProcedure::ThreadProcedure(NiThread* pkThread)
{
    m_pkStream-&gt;BackgroundLoad();
    return 0;
}
</pre> 

<p>In this case, once the thread is started, it calls <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoad</span> on the stream which will set 
 a semaphore for synchronization and proceed to load the NIF file. Since 
 the call to <span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoad</span> is made in 
 the newly created thread, the background load has its own execution context 
 separate from the creation context of the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThreadProcedure.htm">NiThreadProcedure</a></span> 
 object.</p>

<h2>Creating an NiThread Object</h2>

<p>Once you have an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThreadProcedure.htm">NiThreadProcedure</a></span> 
 object that performs a valid amount of work, you need to create an <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThread.htm">NiThread</a></span> 
 object that uses that procedure. The code from <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStream</span> 
 that does this is below:</p>

<pre>
m_pkThread = NiThread::Create(m_pkBGLoadProc);
assert(m_pkThread);
m_pkThread-&gt;SetPriority(NiThread::BELOW_NORMAL);
m_pkThread-&gt;Resume();
</pre> 

<p>Note several important things in this code snippet. 
 First, the stream holds onto a reference to the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThreadProcedure.htm">NiThreadProcedure</a></span>. 
 The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThread.htm">NiThread</a></span> 
 object does not assume ownership of the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThreadProcedure.htm">NiThreadProcedure</a></span> 
 as it may be shared across threads, so the stream will be responsible 
 for deleting it. The calling context here also sets the priority to BELOW_NORMAL. 
 This ensures that the newly created thread will not preempt the calling 
 thread. Since all <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiThread.htm">NiThread</a></span> 
 objects are created in the SUSPENDED state, we also call <span class="NDLSystemFont">Resume</span> 
 here to start the newly created thread.</p>

<h2>Thread Synchronization</h2>

<p>Several types of thread synchronization primitives exist 
 in Gamebryo. Applications have access to <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiCriticalSection.htm">NiCriticalSection</a></span>, 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiFastCriticalSection.htm">NiFastCriticalSection</a></span>, 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiSemaphore.htm">NiSemaphore</a></span> 
 for thread synchronization. A brief description of each follows.</p>

<h3>NiCriticalSection</h3>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiCriticalSection.htm">NiCriticalSection</a></span> 
 objects function much like a semaphore with a count of 1 and allow only 
 one thread to access a section of code at a given moment. Unlike semaphores 
 with counts of 1, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiCriticalSection.htm">NiCriticalSection</a></span> 
 objects do safely allow multiple locking meaning that a single thread 
 can lock the section multiple times provided it also unlocks that critical 
 section the same number of times when releasing. <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiCriticalSection.htm">NiCriticalSection</a></span> 
 objects use operating system level structures and are ideal for preventing 
 multiple access into large blocks of code.</p>

<h3>NiFastCriticalSection</h3>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiCriticalSection.htm">NiFastCricitalSection</a></span> 
 functions much like <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiCriticalSection.htm">NiCriticalSection</a></span> 
 using the same locking and unlocking interfaces. As the name implies, 
 it is designed to perform faster than <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiCriticalSection.htm">NiCriticalSection</a></span> 
 although the degree of this improvement depends on the platform. <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiCriticalSection.htm">NiFastCriticalSection</a></span> 
 does not support multiple locking. Applications that use this class should 
 make sure they do not lock multiple times. Additionally, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiCriticalSection.htm">NiFastCriticalSection</a></span> 
 is intended for short term locking operations that will be completed quickly 
 (e.g. less than 50-100 microseconds.) While <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiCriticalSection.htm">NiFastCriticalSection</a></span> 
 may function correctly for longer segments of code on some platforms, 
 it functions by disabling interrupts on other platforms and disabling 
 interrupts for long periods of time can cause undesired system performance. 
 Because of its focus on high performance, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiCriticalSection.htm">NiFastCriticalSection</a></span> 
 does not support the <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetOwningThreadID</span> 
 or <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetLockingCount</span> interfaces.</p>

<h3>NiSemaphore</h3>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiSemaphore.htm">NiSemaphore</a></span> 
 provides a simple semaphore class for use in synchronization. It can be 
 created with any, non-negative count meaning it can be either signaled 
 or non-signaled at creation.</p>
