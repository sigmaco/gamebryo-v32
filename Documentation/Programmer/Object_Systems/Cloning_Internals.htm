<h1>Cloning Internals</h1>

<p>Cloning is the system by which objects can copy themselves and associated
objects. For example, cloning a node causes it to clone all of its children. As
a result, cloning policy within an object can be complex (for example, objects
can decide internally whether to clone their referenced objects or share them).
The following sections describe how cloning is implemented internally, to
assist applications in adding cloning behavior to their own classes.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObject::Clone</span> calls two virtual
functions that are implemented appropriately in derived classes:</p>
<pre>
virtual NiObject* CreateClone(NiCloningProcess&amp; kCloning);
virtual void ProcessClone(NiCloningProcess&amp; kCloning);
</pre>

<p>The implementation of <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateClone</span> is
similar for all classes. For example, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiGenericObject::CreateClone</span> is implemented as
follows:</p>
<pre>
NiObject* NiGenericObject::CreateClone(NiCloningProcess&amp; kCloning)
{
    NiGenericObject* pkClone = NiNew NiGenericObject;
    CopyMembers(pkClone , kCloning);
    return pkClone;
}
</pre>

<p>Because this code is so common, a macro exists called <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiImplementCreateClone</span>. The above code snippet would be
represented with the code below using the macro.</p>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiImplementCreateClone(NiGenericObject);</span></p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">CopyMembers</span> is a non-virtual function
defined by each class. It copies the appropriate data from the master object
("<span class="NDLSystemFont">this</span>") to the cloned object (pointed to by
the first argument). All implementations of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CopyMembers</span> should start by calling their base class's
implementation of <span class="NDLSystemFont">CopyMembers</span>. <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiPointLight::CopyMembers</span>, for example, calls
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiLight::CopyMembers</span> before copying data
members from "<span class="NDLSystemFont">this</span>" to the cloned object
specified by the first argument to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CopyMembers</span>.</p>

<p>When <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateClone</span> is called, an object
that is cloning itself does not have access to other cloned objects. For
example, when an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span> is cloned, it is
impossible to determine at the time that <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateClone</span> is called whether the lights that illuminate
the node have been or will be cloned. But an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiNode.htm">NiNode</a></span>
object has some work to do to clone itself that depends on whether the lights
are cloned. <span class="NDLSystemFont">ProcessClone</span> exists to address
this problem. The function is called upon the root of the original scene after
the entire tree has completed the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CreateClone</span> pass. Thus, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ProcessClone</span> forms a post-processing phase that can link
the existing objects as needed. By the time <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ProcessClone</span> is called, all objects that will be cloned
have been cloned. The cloned object that corresponds to an original object can
be accessed through a hash table that is a member of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiCloningProcess.htm">NiCloningProcess</a></span>
object passed into the function. The hash table is declared in NiCloningProcess
as follows:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">public: NiTPointerMap&lt;NiObject*,
NiObject*&gt;* m_pkCloneMap;</span></p>

<p>The class implementing the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ProcessClone</span>
function can access the cloned version of itself as shown below. In a similar
fashion, member variables of the original class can be retrieved from the clone
map to determine whether or not they have been cloned.</p>
<pre>
void NiGenericObject::ProcessClone(NiCloningProcess&amp; kCloning)
{
    // Call parent class ProcessClone function.
    NiParentObject::ProcessClone(kCloning);
 
    // Get a pointer to the cloned version of this object. This should always exist.
    NiObject* pkClone;
    bool bCloned = kCloning.m_pkCloneMap-&gt;GetAt(this, pkClone);
    assert(bCloned);
    NiGenericObject* pkDest = (NiGenericObject*) pkClone;
 
    // Get a pointer to the cloned version of the NiLight* member variable
    // for this class. That member may or may not have been cloned.
    bCloned = kCloning.m_pkCloneMap-&gt;GetAt(m_pkLight, pkClone);
    if (bCloned)
    {
        pkDest-&gt;m_pkLight = (NiLight*) pkClone;
        // pkDest-&gt;m_pkLight points to the cloned version of m_pkLight.
    }
    else
    {
        // m_pkLight was not cloned.
        pkDest-&gt;m_pkLight = m_pkLight;
    }
</pre>

<p>A parallel to the code in the above <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ProcessClone</span> function call also occurs in the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CopyMembers</span> function for <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm">NiAVObject</a>. The original
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span> object cannot know whether or not
its properties have already been cloned, because they may be potentially shared
amongst many objects. The property needs to be cloned as part of the cloning
process, but it should only be cloned once. Therefore, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CopyMembers</span> needs to check whether the property has
previously been cloned through the clone map before creating another one.
<a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiObject.htm">NiObject</a> provides a
convenience function for the case of objects which may have already been
potentially cloned: <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiObject::CreateSharedClone()</span>. This function will safely
create a clone of a potentially shared object in the scene graph.</p>

<p>Objects that are shared rather than cloned do not implement any cloning
functions. They should inherit (or replicate) the behavior of <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiObject::CreateClone</span>, which just returns "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">this</span>" rather than allocating a new object, and
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObject::ProcessClone</span>, which does
nothing.</p>
