<h1>Streaming</h1>

<p>Streaming provides a way of saving and loading scene 
 graphs and other Gamebryo objects to and from disk. The streaming system 
 can also be used to stream Gamebryo objects to and from monolithic memory 
 buffers. Streaming is implemented by the Gamebryo class <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span>. 
 Saving, loading, and background loading are described below.</p>

<p>The object creation functions necessary to load the 
 classes in a particular Gamebryo library are automatically registered 
 when the top-level header file for that library is included in an animation. 
 For example, if you want to load a NIF file containing <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAnimation</span> 
 objects, you must include <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAnimation.h</span> 
 in your application.</p>

<h2>NiStream object list</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 gives an application access to a list of objects that are to be saved 
 or that have been loaded. The functions that provide access to this list 
 are:</p>

<pre>
void InsertObject(NiObject* pkObject);
void RemoveObject(NiObject* pkObject);
void RemoveAllObjects();
NiObject* GetObjectAt(unsigned int i) const;
unsigned int GetObjectCount() const;
</pre> 

<h2>Stream Saving</h2>

<p>The file suffix traditionally used by <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 is &quot;NIF&quot;. Saving objects to a NIF file is illustrated by the 
 code shown below:</p>

<pre>
NiCamera* pkCamera = &lt;some camera&gt;;
NiLight* pkLight = &lt;some light&gt;;
NiNode* pkScene = &lt;some scene graph&gt;;
 
NiStream kStream;
kStream.InsertObject(pkCamera);
kStream.InsertObject(pkLight);
kStream.InsertObject(pkScene);
kStream.Save("MYFILE.NIF");
</pre> 

<p>An entire scene graph can be saved by inserting the 
 root <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiNode.htm">NiNode</a></span> 
 of the scene graph into the stream. Code in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 sees to it that any objects referred to by an object that is inserted 
 into a stream (for example, a node's children) are also saved.</p>

<p>Note that some issues arise with saving geometric data 
 as described <a href="Streaming.htm#StreamingOutGeometricData">below</a>.</p>

<h2>Stream Loading</h2>

<p>Loading objects is illustrated by the code shown below:</p>

<pre>
NiTObjectArray&lt;NiObjectPtr&gt; kObjects;
NiStream kStream;
kStream.Load("MYFILE.NIF");
for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; kStream.GetObjectCount(); i++)
{
    NiObject* pkObject = kStream.GetObjectAt(i);
    kObjects.Add(pkObject);
}
</pre>

<p>The number of objects indicated by <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetObjectCount</span> will 
 be the same number of objects that were inserted into the saved stream 
 by calling <span class="NDLSystemFont">InsertObject</span>. 
 However, this is only the count of the top-level objects that are manually 
 registered with the stream. Objects that are streamed implicitly as children 
 or referenced objects of the ones inserted manually will not appear in 
 this count or in the array of top-level objects. Furthermore, the order 
 in which the objects are returned by <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetObjectAt</span> 
 will be the same order in which the objects were inserted into the stream. 
 If you do not know how many objects are in a NIF file, or in what order 
 the objects are stored, you can process them using run-time type information:</p>

<pre>
NiTObjectArray&lt;NiCameraPtr&gt; kCameras;
NiTObjectArray&lt;NiLightPtr&gt; kLights;
NiTObjectArray&lt;NiNodePtr&gt; kScenes;
NiStream kStream;
kStream.Load("MYFILE.NIF");
for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; kStream.GetObjectCount(); i++)
{
    NiObject* pkObject = kStream.GetObjectAt(i);
    if (NiIsKindOf(NiCamera, pkObject))
        kCameras.Add((NiCamera*) pkObject);
    else if (NiIsKindOf(NiLight, pkObject))
        kLights.Add((NiLight*) pkObject);
    else if (NiIsKindOf(NiNode, pkObject))
        kScenes.Add((NiNode*) pkObject);
    else
    {
        // unknown object, handle it somehow
    }
}
</pre>

<a name=Background_Loading></a><h2>Background Loading</h2>

<p>The previous section demonstrated how to use <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 to load a NIF file synchronously. The application blocks while waiting 
 for the file to be loaded. Background loading provides a way to load a 
 NIF file asynchronously. The application can continue to do other things, 
 such as display a loading progress bar, while the file is loading. The 
 following declarations from the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 class define the background loading interface:</p>

<pre>
enum ThreadStatus
{
    IDLE,
    LOADING,
    CANCELLING,
    PAUSING,
    PAUSED
};
 
struct LoadState
{
    float m_fReadProgress; // [0.0f..1.0f]
    float m_fLinkProgress; // [0.0f..1.0f]
};
 
void BackgroundLoadBegin(const char* pcFileName);
void BackgroundLoadBegin(NiBinaryStream* pkIstr);
ThreadStatus BackgroundLoadPoll(LoadState* pkState);
void BackgroundLoadPause();
void BackgroundLoadResume();
void BackgroundLoadCancel();
bool BackgroundLoadFinish();
bool BackgroundLoadGetExitStatus() const;
virtual void BackgroundLoadOnExit();
</pre>

<p>The global function <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/Platform_Independent_Wrappers_For_System_Routines.htm">NiSleep</a></span>, 
 which is declared in <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSystem.h</span>, 
 is an important component of the background loading system:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">void NiSleep(unsigned int uiMilliseconds);</span></p>

<p>An application begins a background load by calling either 
 version of <span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadBegin</span>. 
 The background load runs in a separate thread with a lower priority than 
 the thread that created it. </p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadPoll</span> 
 returns the status of the most recently launched background load. The 
 following values, enumerated in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span>, 
 define the possible states:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">IDLE</span>: No background 
 load is in process. Either no background load has been launched or the 
 most recently launched background load has finished.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">LOADING</span>: 
 The most recently launched background load is still in progress. If the 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">pkState</span> argument to <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadPoll</span> is not <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NULL</span>, it will be filled in 
 with data that provides more information about the progress of the load. 
 When a background load begins, <span class="NDLSystemFont">pkState-&gt;m_fReadProgress</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">pkState-&gt;m_fLinkProgress</span> 
 are both <span class="NDLSystemFont">0.0</span>. As the 
 NIF file is read into memory, <span class="NDLSystemFont">m_fReadProgress</span> 
 increases from <span class="NDLSystemFont">0.0</span> to 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">1.0</span>. After <span class="NDLSystemFont">m_fReadProgress</span> 
 reaches <span class="NDLSystemFont">1.0</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">m_fLinkProgress</span> 
 will increase from <span class="NDLSystemFont">0.0</span> 
 to <span class="NDLSystemFont">1.0</span> as the linking 
 code runs, doing work such as making scene graph connections. The relative 
 speeds of the reading and linking steps depend on the speed of the medium 
 from which the NIF file is read. For example, the reading time will take 
 a larger percentage of the total load time when reading from a CD than 
 it will when reading from a hard disk. It is not necessarily true that 
 a load has finished when <span class="NDLSystemFont">m_fReadProgress</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">m_fLinkProgress</span> are 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">1.0</span>. You must wait until 
 the state changes to IDLE.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">PAUSING</span>: 
 A call to <span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadPause</span> has signalled 
 this thread to pause at the next possible point. Background loads must 
 wait for certain synchronization points to pause to insure that they can 
 safely be interrupted.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">PAUSED</span>: The most recently 
 launched background has been paused by a call to <span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadPause</span>. 
 It will remain in this state until <span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadResume</span>, 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadCancel</span>, 
 or <span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadFinish</span> 
 is called.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">CANCELLING</span>: The application 
 has requested that the most recently launched background load be cancelled 
 by calling <span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadCancel</span>, 
 but the cancel request has not yet been processed by the background loading 
 thread. In order to allow a background loading thread to clean up after 
 itself, a background loading thread cannot be killed outright. Instead, 
 a variable is set asking the background loading thread to exit. After 
 the background loading thread has received and processed the cancel request, 
 the status returned by <span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadPoll</span> 
 transitions from <span class="NDLSystemFont">CANCELLING</span> 
 to <span class="NDLSystemFont">IDLE</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadPause</span> 
 pauses the thread in which the background load is running. See the above 
 description of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">PAUSED</span> 
 state.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadResume</span> 
 unpauses a background load which has been paused by a call to <span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadPause</span>.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadCancel</span> 
 requests that the most recently launched background load be cancelled. 
 See the above description of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CANCELLING 
 </span>state.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadFinish</span> 
 blocks until the most recently launched background load finishes. The 
 return value is <span class="NDLSystemFont">true</span> 
 if the load succeeded and <span class="NDLSystemFont">false</span> 
 if it failed.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadGetExitStatus</span> 
 returns the exit status of the most recently completed background load: 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">true</span> 
 if the load succeeded and <span class="NDLSystemFont">false</span> 
 if it failed.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadOnExit</span> 
 is a virtual function. The implementation of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStream::BackgroundLoadOnExit</span> 
 does nothing. This function is called by the background loading thread 
 immediately after it finishes loading the requested file. Application 
 writers may find it useful to derive their own class from <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span>, 
 overload <span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadOnExit</span>, 
 and use their overridden version to do post-loading tasks that are more 
 appropriately run in the background thread than in the foreground thread 
 that launched the background load. Examples of typical tasks that would 
 be performed in an overloaded version of <span class="NDLSystemFont">BackgroundLoadOnExit</span> 
 include creating property and effect states for the objects in the newly 
 loaded NIF file and precaching geometry objects from the newly loaded 
 NIF file.</p>

<p>On all platforms, the thread that performs the background 
 load is created with a lower priority than the foreground thread that 
 creates it. This is done to prevent the background thread from ever stealing 
 cycles from the foreground thread. One implication of this is that, on 
 most platforms, the background thread will never run unless the foreground 
 thread yields the processor. The foreground thread can yield the processor 
 to a background thread by calling the global function <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiSystem/Platform_Independent_Wrappers_For_System_Routines.htm">NiSleep</a></span>. 
 The <span class="NDLSystemFont">uiMilliseconds</span> argument 
 to <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSystem/Platform_Independent_Wrappers_For_System_Routines.htm">NiSleep</a></span> 
 indicates how long the foreground thread should sleep.</p>

<p>After a background load exits successfully, objects 
 from the loaded NIF file are accessed exactly as they are after a synchronous 
 NIF file load. See the previous section for details.</p>

 Options</h2>

<h3>Internal Textures</h3>

<p>NIF files are often saved using internal textures. The 
 principal advantage of this approach is that each such NIF file contains 
 everything it needs to load the NIF file at load time.</p>

<p>Textures that are internal to a NIF may be shared, even 
 across NIF files, but only if the same texture palette is used to load 
 all those NIF files (either by using the same <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 or by transferring the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturePalette.htm">NiTexturePalette</a></span> 
 from one <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 to another). This sharing is best managed by the application which knows 
 when streams may or may not share an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturePalette.htm">NiTexturePalette</a></span> 
 to minimize the complexity of thread-safety issues.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiSourceTexture.htm">NiSourceTexture</a></span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiSourceCubeMap.htm">NiSourceCubeMap</a></span> 
 texture objects may be created from either <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData.htm">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</a></span> 
 or <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span> 
 objects, which are the two main forms of source texture data representation 
 in Gamebryo.</p>

<p>Platform-specific texture capabilities, available via 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData.htm">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</a></span> 
 objects, enable platform-specific source texture renderer data to be loaded 
 directly into a renderer-specific resource at application load time, with 
 two very beneficial results:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Improvements in &quot;high 
 water mark&quot; behavior for texture memory at load time. Specifically, 
 temporary memory allocations for texture format conversion will not be 
 required if a platform-specific export option is requested in the art 
 pipeline.</li>
	
	<li>Load time performance 
 improvements, since there are no texture format conversions (including 
 texture tiling in the case of Xbox360) at load time.</li>
</ul>

<p>These capabilities operate on the principle of streaming 
 persistent versions of source texture renderer data to support platform-specific 
 texture format conversions for &quot;internal textures&quot; (those included 
 in a scene's NIF file) at export time.</p>

<p>Assuming that the specific platform can support the 
 pixel format in question at application load time, the renderer will load 
 the persistent source texture renderer data directly into a renderer-specific 
 resource, bypassing the application-level <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span> 
 object and all <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiImageConverter.htm">NiImageConverter</a></span>-based 
 texture conversion at load time entirely.</p>

<p>Use of platform-specific textures can reduce the &quot;high 
 water mark&quot; for each texture by up to 50%, which is an important 
 consideration, given that the majority of data by volume will likely be 
 texture data. These savings are especially important on consoles.</p>

<p>To specify platform-specific textures for export from 
 the art packages, you may select any of the non-generic platform types 
 with internal textures (include textures in main NIF). Specifically, these 
 platform-specific internal texture choices include: Xbox360, Playstation3, 
 and DX9.</p>

<p>A caveat to this approach is that the texture is configured 
 specifically for a target platform (or graphics card), and may not be 
 loadable for use with alternative platforms or graphics cards, or with 
 tools on the PC. If a texture is configured specifically for one target 
 platform or graphics card, but an attempt is made to load it on a platform 
 or graphics card that can't support it, <a href="../../Programmer/Texturing/Failures.htm">&quot;error&quot; 
 replacement textures</a> are used to indicate load-time errors.</p>

<p><b>Note: If application requirements 
 dictate fully general support of textures within a NIF file on multiple 
 platforms or graphics cards, then <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span>-based 
 textures should be used</b>, since they enable on the fly texture format 
 conversions at load time. For example, DX9-specific textures may be problematic, 
 since there are so many diverse graphics cards your application may have 
 to support. To specify <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span>-based 
 textures for export from the art packages, you may select &quot;generic&quot; 
 platform type, but include textures in the main NIF, for example.</p>

<p>Note that each time a platform SDK (for example, Xbox360 XDK 
 or Playstation3 SDK) changes, there is at least a possibility that the 
 new SDK will cause textures to be formatted differently on that platform. 
 It is not likely to happen frequently, but the possibility exists. In 
 such a case, it may be desirable to re-export Nifs containing platform-specific 
 textures using exporters built with that platform's most recent SDK version.</p>

<p>Consult the export options for <a href="../../Art/Max/Gamebryo_3ds_max_Export_Options1.htm">3ds 
 max</a> or <a href="../../Art/Maya/Export_Display_Options.htm">Maya</a> 
 or the reference information on <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData.htm">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</a></span> 
 for more details.</p>

<h3>External Textures</h3>

<p>NIF files may also be saved using external textures&mdash;in this case, the NIF file only stores a string path to each of its 
 textures, not the pixel data itself. This has several advantages, especially 
 during development. The NIF files are smaller, texture images can be edited 
 without having to re-export the content, and image files can be shared 
 across multiple NIFs.</p>

<p>There are several options that allow applications to 
 customize how the images are located and loaded from these external references. 
 These two options are the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span>'s 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiTexturePalette</a></span>, 
 and the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span>'s 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiSearchPath.htm">NiSearchPath</a></span>. 
 The basic method used when searching for a texture is as follows:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li>Load the filename as 
 stored in the NIF file</li>
	
	<li>For each path returned 
 by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SearchPath</span> object
	
  	<ul>
  		
  		<li>Query for an image 
   with name path+filename in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">TexturePalette</span></li>
  		
  		<li>If a texture with 
   that name is returned by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">TexturePalette</span>, 
   DONE</li>
  	</ul>
	
	</li>	
	
	<li>For each path returned 
 by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SearchPath</span> object
	
  	<ul>
  		
  		<li>Attempt to find 
   the file path+filename on disk</li>
  		
  		<li>If a texture file 
   is found at path+filename, DONE</li>
  	</ul>
	
	</li>	
	
	<li>Fail the loading of 
 the texture, leaving no pixel data in the texture&mdash;DONE</li>
</ol>

<p>While this behavior is hard-coded into the engine, the 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">TexturePalette</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">SearchPath</span> 
 objects both contain app-adjustable settings, and are also based on virtual 
 functions, allowing advanced applications to completely override the behavior 
 of either step.</p>

<h4>Image File Search Path</h4>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 contains a pointer to an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiSearchPath.htm">NiSearchPath</a></span> 
 object.&nbsp; The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 object's search path can be retrieved or set using:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSearchPath* NiStream::GetSearchPath() const<br>
void iStream::SetSearchPath(NiSearchPath* pkSearchPath</span></p>

<p>Each <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiSearchPath.htm">NiSearchPath</a></span> 
 object has a standard set of search paths that it returns whenever queried 
 by the imaging system.&nbsp; By default, an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 contains a pointer to an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiSearchPath.htm">NiSearchPath</a></span> 
 object instance.&nbsp; The reference documentation for NiSystem describes 
 in detail the paths that objects of this type return.&nbsp; However, one 
 of the paths that is returned is directly adjustable by the application&mdash;the static &quot;default&quot; path.&nbsp; An application may access 
 or change the default path for all <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiSearchPath.htm">NiSearchPath</a></span> 
 objects using:</p>

<pre>
static void NiSearchPath::SetDefaultPath(const char* pcPath)
static const char* NiSearchPath::GetDefaultPath()
</pre> 

<p>These functions allow the user to set a directory that 
 will always be searched for the application's textures.&nbsp; More advanced 
 applications may subclass the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiSystem/NiSearchPath.htm">NiSearchPath</a></span> 
 class, replacing the functions that return paths with whatever behavior 
 is desired.&nbsp; Instances of this subclass may then be set upon each 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 as the search path for that stream.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Texture Image Palette</h3>

<p>Each <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 contains a pointer to an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturePalette.htm">NiTexturePalette</a></span> 
 object, which implements a lookup table interface for mapping image file 
 names to textures.&nbsp; This ensures that if the same image filename 
 is used in multiple places in the same NIF file, it will simply share 
 a single instance of the image.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Sometimes an application wants to create multiple <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 objects and use each of them to load a scene graph. The scene graphs loaded 
 by the different <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 objects may happen to share some texture images. By default, each <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 object maintains its own individual hash table that independently maps 
 file names to loaded images. By default, images that could be shared across 
 the streams will actually be individually loaded (i.e. duplicated) by 
 the two streams. To allow different stream objects to share the same images, 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 provides the ability to set the same <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturePalette.htm">NiTexturePalette</a></span> 
 on multiple streams, using the following accessors:</p>

<pre>
void SetTexturePalette(NiTexturePalette* pkTexturePalette)
NiTexturePalette* GetTexturePalette() const

<p>An even more powerful trick that is available through 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturePalette.htm">NiTexturePalette</a></span> 
 class is the ability to replace it.&nbsp; An application can subclass 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturePalette.htm">NiTexturePalette</a></span>, 
 allowing the app to receive the equivalent of a callback each time the 
 streaming system needs to load a texture from a file.&nbsp; In the most 
 extreme case, an application could implement their own texture archive 
 system, loading a single NIF file that contains all of the app's textures 
 in a single stream load call, and then doling out pointers to these textures 
 via their own <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturePalette.htm">NiTexturePalette</a></span> 
 subclass as each texture request came in.</p>

<a name=StreamingOutGeometricData></a><h2>Streaming Out Geometric 
 Data</h2>

<p>With the introduction of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a> 
 </span>and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm">NiDataStream</a></span>, 
 the possibility exists that geometric data is loaded directly into memory 
 not accessible by the CPU for streaming. In these situations, applications 
 will need to take additional steps to insure that geometric data can be 
 streamed out to a NIF file. The following options are available:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Stream with no application 
 changes - Data without <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::ACCESS_CPU_READ</span> 
 in the access flag will stream out as zeroes instead of the actual data 
 values. The application will assert.</li>
	
	<li>Use the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStreamFactory.htm">NiDataStreamFactory</a></span> 
 callback to force CPU read access at stream creation - The NIF will stream 
 out succesfully, but the access flags on the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> 
 objects will be changed which may change application behavior upon reloading 
 the saved NIF.</li>
	
	<li>Load NIF files prior 
 to creating a renderer to create a streamable version - Since the renderer 
 overrides the data stream factory, NIF files loaded prior to the renderer 
 will use <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiToolDataStream.htm">NiToolDataStream</a></span> 
 objects and be completely streamable. Applications can deep copy the scene 
 graph to create a renderable version.</li>
</ul>

<p>For debugging purposes, it is likely acceptable to use 
 the second option and set the access flag via the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreamFactory</span> 
 callback.</p>

<h2>File Version and File User Version</h2>

<p>Each <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 contains two different version values. When loading, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm">NiStream</a></span> 
 will guarantee the version of the stream is compatible with the current 
 version of Gamebryo by checking the Min and Max versions. <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetFileVersion()</span> 
 is used by Gamebryo to insure engine compatible with loading this stream. 
 <!--kadov_tag{{<spaces>}}-->&nbsp;<span class="NDLSystemFont"><!--kadov_tag{{</spaces>}}-->GetFileUserDefinedVersion()</span> 
 is also used to handle any necessary version information defined by the 
 user. Both the file version and the user defined file version must be 
 correct for the file to load.</p>

<a name=Endianness></a><h2>Endianness</h2>

<p>By default, all <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStream</span> 
 objects save in the endianness of the platform upon which the stream saving 
 code executes (i.e. saving a file with an application running on a PC 
 will use the PC endianness). However, Gamebryo is capable of loading and 
 saving objects of either endianness on any platform. However, both loading 
 and saving operations are more expensive if the selected endianness does 
 not match that of the platform being used to accomplish the load or save 
 operation. This is due to the fact that every individual piece of data 
 that is streamed out must be byte swapped to the desired endianness. This 
 is a reasonable tradeoff in the case of saving, since it is better to 
 save a file with the endianness of the target platform, even if it differs 
 from the endianness of the platform being used to save the file. In most 
 cases, it is best to make the save operation more expensive (i.e. do the 
 endian conversion) in order to make the loading operation run in native 
 endianness.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStream</span> provides several 
 member functions related to endianness:</p>


<pre>
    // Set this stream to save as little/big endian
    void SetSaveAsLittleEndian(bool bLittle);
 
    // Will this stream save as little endian?
    bool GetSaveAsLittleEndian();
 
    // Was the file that this stream loaded little endian?
    bool GetSourceIsLittleEndian();
</pre>
 
<p>As a side note, the function <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSystemDesc::GetSystemDesc().IsLittleEndian()</span> 
 can be used to determine the endianness of the executing platform. This 
 information allows the above member functions to be set dependent upon 
 the current platform.</p>

<p>During the course of development for a multi-platform 
 application, assets for one platform may need to be loaded on another 
 to facilitate the art pipeline or to more easily test those assets. As 
 previously mentioned, loading files that were saved in another platform's 
 endianness is much slower than loading files that are native. Therefore, 
 at some point, it may be desirable to save out all assets for the particular 
 platform upon which they will be loaded.</p>

<p>Gamebryo provides a static function, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiBinaryStream::SetEndianMatchHint(bool 
 bForceMatch)</span>. If the boolean parameter is false (the default at 
 Gamebryo startup), then the behavior is to automatically endian-swap loaded 
 files to the platform's endianness if the endianness of the file does 
 not match the platform. This is very convenient, but as discussed above 
 it can lead to slow loading when the file endianness does not match that 
 of the loading platform. Setting this flag to true will disable swapping. 
 When set to true, classes that use <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiBinaryStream</span> 
 will require that the endianness of all loaded files match the endianness 
 of the platform they are being loaded upon, failing to load those for 
 which the endianness of the file and that of the loading platform do not 
 match. It is important to note that this function only provides a hint, 
 although it is respected by both <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStream</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">ActorManager</span>. By setting this static 
 flag, it can become very easy to find files of the wrong endianness that 
 would otherwise slow the loading process.</p>
