<h1>Built-in API Limitations</h1>

<p>Gamebryo LightSpeed built-in APIs have some limitations. These limitations center on how Lua
interprets overloaded C++ functions and on the mechanism for blocking from a built-in API method.</p>

<h4>Overloaded built-in API functions</h4>

<p>In C++ you can overload a function by providing another function with the same name but
different arguments. It is possible to bind overloaded C++ methods for use as built-in API functions, but
there are some significant limitations. Many unique C++ data types are bound into scripting
languages as a single script type. As a result, when passing these values out of the script and
back into C++, there is no way to tell which C++ override should be called. The details of which
overrides can be supported depend on the scripting language in question. In general, overloading of
vastly different types such as a string type and an integer type is safe. However, overloading
similar types such as signed versus unsigned integers is unlikely to work correctly.</p>

<p>Lua supports a relatively small set of unique data types. Some common examples of types that
cannot be used for overloading because they look the same to Lua include:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>C++ Types</th>

            <th>Reason</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>EntityID, Category, UInt64, SInt64, UInt32, SInt32, all enums and other POD
            integers</td>

            <td>Gamebryo LightSpeed uses large number support in Lua to maintain 64 bit integers,
            but all integer types still look identical inside of Lua.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Float32, Float64</td>

            <td>Normally, Lua treats all numbers, including integers, as 64 bit floating point
            numbers. However, because LightSpeed uses large number support, only floating point
            types are treated this way.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Blocking from built-in API functions</h4>

<p>In this release of LightSpeed, there is no generic mechanism for blocking from a built-in API
function. The existing blocking built-in API functions, such as BehaviorAPI.SendAndWaitForReply and
BehaviorAPI.Sleep, are specially implemented for each supported scripting language. Only scripted
behaviors are capable of blocking.</p>

<h4>Custom data type parameters</h4>

<p>All parameters used in built-in API functions require binding code to map them to and from C++ and
the scripting language. If you want to use a custom data type in a built-in API then you will need to
provide this mapping code. For details on how to do this, see <a href=
"builtin_adding_datatypes.htm">Adding new data types</a>.</p>

<h4>Variadic functions are not supported</h4>

<p>Functions that support a variable number of parameters cannot be used as a built-in API function. Logs are
therefore formatted in the scripting language before being passed thru a built-in to the C++
code.</p>
<pre>
BehaviorAPI.LogMessage(2, string.format("BgAIJack::OnTick(%x) Initial Placement", entityID))
