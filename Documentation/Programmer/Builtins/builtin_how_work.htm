<h1>How Custom Built-in  API Functions Work</h1>

<p>Custom Built-in API functions are C++ functions that are bound to a scripting language for use by the Behavior
system. They are either bound via SWIG (BehaviorAPI) or directly bound to the scripting language
(egfPython/egfLua). There are a large number of pre-defined built-in API functions, but there are only a very
small number of pre-defined behaviors (mainly life cycle behaviors like OnInit, OnPreMigrate,
OnPostMigrate, OnDestroy).</p>

<p>Normally, the declarations of the built-in API functions for a given system service are isolated into their
own header file. This makes it clear which calls are actually built-in API functions and which system service
module is implementing them. This approach also makes it easy to do automatic scripting language
bindings using SWIG. SWIG reads a .i specification file and generates a C++ file that interacts
with the virtual machine to expose C++ methods and types. It also generates a scripting language
module that can be imported into an application behavior script to declare those now
language-specific calls.</p>

<p>Emergent implements built-in API functions as global functions. As much as possible, this removes dependence
on scripting-language dependent features such as objects or inheritance, both of which might
interfere with the Emergent object model. A built-in API function can have an arbitrary signature, taking
developer-specified parameters and return value. A C++ behavior can call a built-in API function directly. A
behavior implemented in a scripting language must call the built-in API functions through a scripting
language-specific binding.</p>
