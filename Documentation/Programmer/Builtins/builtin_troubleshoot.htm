<h1>Troubleshooting Built-in API Functions</h1>

<h4>General troubleshooting tips</h4>

<p>It is important to remember that, like a behavior, a built-in API function is a function you can call from
script. Therefore, the guidelines for <a href=
"../Behaviors/behavior_troubleshoot.htm">Troubleshooting behaviors</a> apply to built-in API functions as
well.</p>

<p>Sometimes adding a built-in API function call to an already complex script can obscure the real problem. Try
creating a new entity, give it a new behavior (a lifecycle behavior such as OnCreate is a good
choice, since all you need to do to ensure the behavior gets called is add an instance of the
entity to the world), and then see if you can call the built-in API function from within this behavior.</p>

<h4>Troubleshooting missing functions</h4>

<p>The most common problem you will encounter is that the scripting runtime cannot find the
built-in API function. Here are some specific things to look for in this case:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Make sure you are using the fully-qualified name. It is not necessary to explicitly import
    the function (e.g. using "require" in Lua or "import" in Python) but you must prefix the
    function call with the module name:
        <pre class="indent1">
BehaviorAPI.LogMessage()
ecr.GetAttachmentTransform()
bapionline.SetReplicationCategory()
MyModule.MyFunc()
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Spelling errors. Since scripts are not compiled, typos show up as runtime errors rather
    than syntax errors. The places you need to compare are:

        <ul>
            <li>The calling script.</li>

            <li>The exported module name. If you are loading the module statically, check the
            SWIG-generated wrapper for a #define called "SWIG_name." If you are importing the
            function from a DLL, check the appropriate LoadBuiltin directive in your config.ini
            file, as described under <a href="builtin_custom_dynamic_load.htm">Dynamically loading
            custom built-ins</a>.</li>

            <li>The function name as exported by the initialization function. You will find this in
            your SWIG-generated wrapper file in an array called swig_commands. If you exported the
            function manually, then it will be wherever you put it!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>If you are dynamically loading a built-in API, make sure the DLL loaded correctly. It might
    have been built with the wrong configuration (release DLL instead of debug DLL, for instance).
    When the system can't find a built-in API DLL, it will log an error:
        <pre class="indent1">
2009/03/11 12:15:48.242|Err1|Lua|||Could not load built-in module 'eonLua',
ensure that this file exists or update your configuration.|
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Make sure the initialization function is being called. Search the wrapper file for a
    function declared using the #define "SWIG_init" and breakpoint it:
        <pre class="indent1">
/* this is the initialization function
  added at the very end of the code
  the function is always called SWIG_init, but an earlier #define will rename it
*/
SWIGEXPORT int SWIG_init(lua_State* L)
</pre>In the case of dynamically loaded built-in API functions where you don't have the DLL source in the same
project, look for the InitBuiltins function in the scheduler appropriate to your scripting
language.
    </li>
</ul>
