<h1>Exposing Custom Built-in API Functions to Lua</h1>

<p>There are two approaches that you can take to expose your built-in API functions to Lua. You can use
SWIG to generate appropriate bindings for you, or you can bind them into the language yourself.</p>

<p>Using SWIG is a quick and easy way to make your built-in API available to scripting languages. By
defining a SWIG binding, you can generate bindings to both Lua and Python. This can save you
considerable time during development because you don't have to write binding code yourself. By
using SWIG as a pre-build step in you projects, your bindings will always reflect the current state
of your built-in API. On the downside, if your <span class="NDLSystemFont">.i</span> definition file
isn't correct, SWIG will generate wrapper files that are technically correct but do not behave as
expected. These errors are typically easy to fix but hard to identify. You're also relying on SWIG
to generate correct binding code.</p>

<p>Creating your own Lua bindings requires a deeper understanding of how Lua works. You can define
exactly how your bindings behave. You'll have total control over how your built-in API is exposed in
Lua. On the downside, you need to maintain binding code by hand, and you must make sure that your
bindings continue to reflect the current state of your built-in API.</p>

<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">To expose a custom built-in API behavior to Lua using SWIG</p>

<p>The easiest way to create built-in API functions is to write plain C-style global functions and
automatically generate scripting bindings using an interface generator such as SWIG or Luabind.
Gamebryo LightSpeed uses SWIG-generated bindings because SWIG supports a wide range of target
scripting languages.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Create a SWIG <span class="NDLSystemFont">.i</span> file to expose your built-in API to script.
    The following example assumes you are defining a Lua module named MyBuiltin.
        <pre>
// The following name is the namespace exposed in scripting languages.
%module MyBuiltin

// Code contained within "%{ ... %}" blocks is directly written into the generated
// wrapper file.  Typically you will want to include whatever header files define the
// built-in API functions.
%{
#include "MyBuiltin.h"
#include &lt;egfLua/bapiLua.h&gt;
%}

// egf/BehaviorAPI.i contains many helpful features for writing your own built-in APIs.  It is
// recommended that it be imported into all other built-in API modules.  By using '%import'
// instead of '%include' we pull in knowledge about BehaviorAPI without actually
// duplicating any of its functionality.
%import "egf/BehaviorAPI.i"

// The example typemap we provide supports passing most Foundation and Game Framework data types.
// It also defines types for maps and lists and rules for treating things as input, output, or
// input-output parameters.  Finally it contains rules for supporting certainly overloaded methods.
%include &lt;egfLua/bapiLuaTypeMaps.i&gt;

// The easiest way to define the functions to be exposed is to simple directly include a C++
// header file containing normal C++ function declarations for all the functions you want to
// bind as built-in API functions.
%include "MyBuiltin.h"
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Create custom build rules on your <span class="NDLSystemFont">.i</span> file to generate a
    wrapper file for the script language that you want to support. The following example shows a
    generated Lua wrapper for the Win32 platform.
        <pre>
SET SWIG_LIB=%EMERGENT_PATH%\Source\3rdParty\SWIG\Lib
@REM the following lines must be on the same line in your custom build command
%EMERGENT_PATH%\Source\3rdParty\SWIG\swig.exe -c++ -lua -DWIN32 -DEE_PLATFORM_WIN32
    -DEE_EXTERNAL_RUNTIME=egfLua\SWIGLuaRuntime.h
    -I"%EMERGENT_PATH%\Source\3rdParty\Lua\Package\src"
    -I"%EMERGENT_PATH%\Source\3rdParty\Lua\Package\src\.."
    -I"%EMERGENT_PATH%\Source\3rdParty\STLPort\Package"
    -I"%EMERGENT_PATH%\Source\3rdParty\TinyXML\Package"
    -I"%EMERGENT_PATH%\Source\Foundation"
    -I"%EMERGENT_PATH%\Source\GameFramework"
    -o MyBuiltin_LuaWrap.cpp MyBuiltin.i
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Add the generated wrapper file to your project and compile.</li>

    <li>Register the SWIG-generated initialization function with the language runtime. This can be
    done dynamically for DLL builds or statically in all build types. For further details, see:

        <ul>
            <li><a href="builtin_custom_static_load.htm">Statically loading custom
            built-ins</a></li>

            <li><a href="builtin_custom_dynamic_load.htm">Dynamically loading custom
            built-ins</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>At this point your built-in API functions are available to call from Lua behaviors. All
    registered modules are automatically pre-loaded, so you should not use a "require" statement
    for your module name. Just call your functions:
        <pre>
local foo = MyBuiltin.CalculateFoo()
</pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">To expose a custom built-in API behavior in Lua by hand</p>

<p>If you are experienced with writing C extensions to Lua, you may wish to implement built-in API
functions using the native Lua C API. This gives you much greater flexibility in supporting
Lua-specific syntax such as variable numbers of arguments. Native methods are also the only methods
that can implement blocking behaviors. The down side is that the resulting methods are harder to
implement and maintain and they only support a single scripting language.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Generate a static list of the functions that you want to expose to Lua from your built-in API.

        <p class="indent1">These functions must have the correct signature of Lua functions and must
        follow all Lua requirements. As such this method is only appropriate for those intimately
        familiar with extending Lua. Lua documentation is available online at <a href=
        "http://www.lua.org/docs.html" target="_blank">http://www.lua.org/docs.html</a>.</p>
        <pre>
int CalculateFoo(lua_State* L);

static const struct luaL_reg MyBuiltinMetaTable [] =
{
    { "CalculateFoo", CalculateFoo },
    {NULL, NULL}  /* sentinel */
};
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Define an initialization function that registers your built-in API with the Lua runtime.

        <p class="indent1">We recommend that this function follow the naming convention
        luaopen_&lt;ModuleName&gt;.</p>
        <pre>
int luaopen_MyBuiltin(lua_State *L)
{
    // Bind all the MyBuiltin API functions in Lua.
    luaL_register(L, "MyBuiltin", streamLibMetaTable);

    // We left a meta table on the stack so return 1
    return 1;
}
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Compile your built-in API.</li>

    <li>Register the manually generated initialization function with the Lua runtime. This is
    identical to the SWIG method detailed above.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Adding native Lua functions to a SWIG generated wrapper</h2>

<p>Using a SWIG generated wrapper provides greater simplicity, but some functionality can only be
obtained using native Lua functions. Some examples that require native Lua functions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Taking a variable number of arguments</li>

    <li>Implementing method overloading in cases SWIG cannot resolve (See <a href=
    "builtin_limitations.htm">built-in limitations</a> for details).</li>

    <li>Blocking built-in functions</li>
</ul>

<p>If you require a native Lua function, this does not preclude you from using SWIG generated
bindings for additional functions. You can use the "%native" keyword in your SWIG <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">.i</span> file. For example, we add several native functions into the BehaviorAPI
module:</p>
<pre>
%native(GetProperty) int egf::lua_GetProperty(lua_State *L);
%native(GetDefaultProperty) int egf::lua_GetDefaultProperty(lua_State *L);
%native(SetProperty) int egf::lua_SetProperty(lua_State* L);
%native(SendAndWaitForReply) int egf::lua_SendAndWaitForReply(lua_State* L);
%native(Sleep) int egf::lua_Sleep(lua_State* L);
</pre>

<p>The Get/SetProperty functions are natively implemented to support more specific method overloading
than what SWIG can provide. SendAndWaitForReply and Sleep are natively implemented so that they can
block the currently running Lua co-routine.</p>
