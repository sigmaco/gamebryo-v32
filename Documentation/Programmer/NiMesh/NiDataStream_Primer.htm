<h1>NiDataStream Primer</h1>

<a name="Creating_Data_Streams" id="Creating_Data_Streams"></a><h2>Creating Data Streams</h2>

<p>To create an instance of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span>, 
 the class that owns the stream data, memory appropriate for the storage 
 of the data must be allocated. Determining the memory pool (typically 
 main memory or VRAM) from which to allocate a stream of vertex data is 
 not a clear decision in all cases. Any CPU side processing  software 
 morphing, software skinning, etc.  suggests placement in main memory, 
 otherwise VRAM may be better. Selection of the memory pool is abstracted 
 from the user, but assisted by the access requirements and usage flags 
 selected by content creators and application authors.</p>

<p>The first requirement of note is the data stream's Usage. 
 There are three primary use cases for data streams:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">USAGE_VERTEX_INDEX</span> 
 - The data specifies an index buffer for use in defining renderer primitives. 
 Note that this isn't necessarily visible to the GPU, the correct access 
 flags (<span class="NDLSystemFont">GPU_READ</span>) must be specified for 
 the application to use this buffer on the GPU.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">USAGE_VERTEX</span> 
 - The data specifies data associated with each vertex of a mesh. Positions, 
 normals, and UV coordinates are examples of per-vertex data. Note that 
 this isn't necessarily visible to the GPU, the correct access flags (<span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">GPU_READ</span>) must be specified for the application 
 to use this buffer on the GPU. All streams with <span class="NDLSystemFont">USAGE_VERTEX 
 </span>must have the same number of elements, unless the elements are 
 <a href="Introduction_to_Instancing.htm">per-instance</a>. 
 It is important to identify vertex usage data streams even when they are 
 not visible to the GPU so that the tool pipeline can properly manipulate 
 the data when performing operations like vertex cache reordering.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">USAGE_USER</span> 
 - This is arbitrary application data stored on the mesh. <a href="Introduction_to_Mesh_Modifiers.htm">Mesh 
 modifiers</a> are examples of classes that need to store per-mesh data. 
 For an example, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">MORPHWEIGHTS</span> are 
 stored in a <span class="NDLSystemFont">USAGE_USER</span> stream when using 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMorphMeshModifier</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Access flags also help determine which memory pool is 
 used by defining how the application intends to read and write to the 
 buffer. The access flags are discussed in detail in the <a href="Data_Stream_Access.htm">Data 
 Stream Access</a> topic.</p>

<a name="NiDataStreamElements" id="NiDataStreamElements"></a><h4>NiDataStreamElements</h4>

<p>Before a <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> 
 can be instantiated, a clear understanding of the contents of the buffer 
 is needed. The <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStreamElement.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreamElement</span></a> class is designed to 
 describe a single element in a data stream. It contains data about the 
 underlying C++ type (float, int, short, etc) and its position in the structure 
 defined by all other elements in the stream. </p>

<a name="CreateSingleElementDataStream" id="CreateSingleElementDataStream"></a><h4>CreateSingleElementDataStream</h4>

<p>It is fairly common to create a data stream that only 
 has one element. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> has a static 
 creation method specifically for this purpose, <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateSingleElementDataStream</span>. 
 Please see the <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm">API 
 reference</a> for more details.</p>

<a name="CreateDataStream" id="CreateDataStream"></a><h4>CreateDataStream</h4>

<p>When a user wishes to create a data stream that has 
 interleaved elements, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> has 
 a static creation method specifically for this purpose, <span class="NDLSystemFont">CreateDataStream</span>. 
 This method takes an array of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreamElements</span> 
 as input. Please see the <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm">API 
 reference</a> for more details.</p>

<a name="NiDataStreamFactory" id="NiDataStreamFactory"></a><h4>NiDataStreamFactory</h4>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> create 
 methods forward the instantiation of the correct derived class to a singleton 
 factory. This factory can be set or retrieved using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Get/SetFactory</span> 
 methods on <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm">NiDataStream</a></span>. 
 Each renderer implements its own version of this method to allow it to 
 create custom renderer-specific data stream classes.</p>
 
<p>In some cases, a user 
 may want to tweak the flags upon creation of a data stream. In this usage 
 scenario, it is possible to install a callback on the data stream factory 
 using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Get/SetCallback</span> methods on 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStreamFactory.htm">NiDataStreamFactory</a></span>. 
 A convenience callback, <span class="NDLSystemFont">ForceCPUReadAccessCallback,</span> 
 is provided for the scenario where CPU read is required by the application 
 on all data streams.</p>

<a name="NiToolDataStream" id="NiToolDataStream"></a><h4>NiToolDataStream</h4>

<p>Gamebryo provides a custom <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> 
 derivate, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiToolDataStream.htm">NiToolDataStream</a></span>, 
 &nbsp;for use 
 inside the tools pipeline. This stream class is far more flexible than 
 its siblings in that it provides full unfettered access to the data through 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont">LOCK_TOOL_READ</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">LOCK_TOOL_WRITE</span> 
 lock flags. These can be seen as "back-door" access flags in 
 scenarios where the tools will not be using the data for rendering but 
 instead want access to the data for processing purposes. If the tools 
 were limited to the same flags as other applications, it would not be 
 possible to properly process the data. These data streams are the default 
 return type from factories that have yet to be replaced by their renderer-specific 
 counterparts.</p>

<a name="Platform_Specific_Data_Streams" id="Platform_Specific_Data_Streams"></a><h4>Platform-Specific 
 Data Streams</h4>

<p>Each renderer implements its own version of the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> API that conforms to the underlying 
 data representation required by the renderer API. In some cases, additional 
 functionality is provided by the renderer. For more details, please see 
 each renderer's documentation.</p>

<a name="NiDataStreamLockPolicy" id="NiDataStreamLockPolicy"></a><h4>NiDataStreamLockPolicy</h4>

<p>Several helper classes, found in <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreamLockPolicy.h</span>, 
 are provided to encapsulate the requirements for thread safety for <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> derivatives. Each class is templated 
 to allow for the data stream derivate to change the implementation and 
 allow the class to be reused by each renderer. If a user wishes to create 
 their own custom derivatives of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span>, 
 it is suggested that they also embed the appropriate lock policy inside 
 their classes. See <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/StaticLockPolicy.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">StaticLockPolicy</span></a>, <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/VolatileLockPolicy.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">VolatileLockPolicy</span></a>, and <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/MutableLockPolicy.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">MutableLockPolicy</span></a> for more details.</p>

<a name="Regions" id="Regions"></a><h4>Regions</h4>

<p>Once a data stream has been created, it is often useful 
 to carve it into smaller sections for use in rendering. These smaller 
 sections allow the renderer to reuse the same buffer when rendering a 
 different object or parts of an object. This can offer a substantial performance 
 gain. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::Region</span> objects encapsulate 
 this idea. <span class="NDLSystemFont">Regions</span> consist of a starting 
 index with respect to the entire buffer and range of indices contained 
 within the region. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Region</span> class also 
 contains several helper methods for working with the return value of <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::Lock</span> on the entire buffer, allowing 
 the user to get the start and end pointers from a base data stream pointer. 
 Please see <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream__Region.htm">NiDataStream::Region</a> 
 for more details.</p>



<a name="Adding_NiDataStreams_to_a_Mesh" id="Adding_NiDataStreams_to_a_Mesh"></a><h2>Adding NiDataStreams 
 to a Mesh</h2>

<p>Once an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> 
 has been defined, in order to be used it has to be attached to an <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span>. A how-to guide for the specific API's 
 can be found at <a href="Creating_an_NiMesh_Object.htm">Creating 
 an NiMesh Object</a> and a general overview is provided in <a href="NiMesh_Primer.htm">NiMesh 
 Primer</a>. This documentation will focus on details missed in those documents.</p>

<a name="NiDataStreamRef" id="NiDataStreamRef"></a><h4>NiDataStreamRef</h4>

<p>In order for a mesh to make use of a data stream, it 
 needs to know the following pieces of information:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>What are the contents 
 of the data stream and how are they differentiated from other data streams 
 attached to the mesh?</li>
	
	<li>What <a href="NiDataStream_Primer.htm#Regions">Region</a> 
 to use when rendering a specific sub-mesh?</li>
</ul>

<p>The class responsible for answering these questions 
 is <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStreamRef.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreamRef</span></a>. Meshes contain a set of 
 stream reference objects, which in turn contain a smart pointer to data 
 streams.</p>

<p><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStreamRef.htm">NiDataStreamRef</a></span> answers the first question 
 through the concept of semantic name/index pairs. These semantic names 
 are <a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiFixedString.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiFixedString</span></a> objects that tie the bytes 
 in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> to some larger concept 
 like vertex positions, normals, indices, or morph targets. The index helps 
 to disambiguate situations where multiple copies of the same name exist 
 on the mesh, such as texture coordinates. These name/index pairs are completely 
 customizable by the developer. The Gamebryo API does depend on certain 
 known name/index pairs, defined in <a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiCommonSemantics.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiCommonSemantics</span></a>, so that it can perform 
 collision detection and other services that rely on the existence of specific 
 semantics.</p>

<p><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStreamRef.htm">NiDataStreamRef</a></span> answers the second question 
 by requiring regions to be bound to specific sub-meshes. This data is 
 stored internally to the class but can be accessed using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetRegionForSubmesh</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">BindRegionToSubmesh</span> methods. Some 
 of the use cases for this functionality are discussed in the <a href="NiMesh_Primer.htm#Use_Cases">Use 
 Cases</a> section of <a href="NiMesh_Primer.htm">NiMesh 
 Primer</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the stream reference contains whether 
 or not the data is per-instance. This is required for <a href="Introduction_to_Instancing.htm">instancing</a> 
 support in Gamebryo. </p>

<p>It is often useful to interact with the stream reference 
 directly as it shadows most of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> 
 API for user convenience.</p>

<h4>NiMesh::AddStreamRef and AddStream</h4>

<p>Generally speaking, users do not manually create <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStreamRef.htm">NiDataStreamRef</a></span> objects. These classes 
 are usually created internal to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> 
 in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">AddStreamRef</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">AddStream</span> 
 methods. <a href="Creating_an_NiMesh_Object.htm">Creating 
 an NiMesh Object</a> outlines how to use these methods to properly attach 
 an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> to a <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span>.</p>

<a name="Data_Streams_and_Mesh_Modifiers" id="Data_Streams_and_Mesh_Modifiers"></a><h2>Data Streams 
 and Mesh Modifiers</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm#Public_NiMeshModifier_Helper_Methods">NiMesh::ResetModifiers</a></span> 
 function should be called for any mesh when the data streams on it are 
 added, removed or otherwise changed and the modifiers on the mesh have 
 already been attached. It causes all modifiers to be detached and then 
 attached again, thus resetting any references the modifiers might have 
 into the data streams.</p>
