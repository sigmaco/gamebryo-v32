<h1>Serialization of Data Streams</h1>

<h2>RTTI and CreateObject</h2>

<p>Since <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> 
 itself is an abstract base class, it is worthwhile to examine how it is 
 created during the streaming process as it is different from the normal 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObject</span> path. </p>

<p>In order to properly create a data stream, two pieces 
 of information are required: usage and access flags. Since the correct 
 derived class is created based on those inputs, it is necessary for the 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStream</span> to know this information when 
 it creates the objects contained within it. This is accomplished by overloading 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetStreamableRTTIName</span> method from 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObject</span>. Inside this method, the usage 
 and access mask are converted to strings and concatenated using the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiStream::ms_cRTTIDelimiter</span> variable. When 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream:CreateObject</span> call is 
 made during the loading process, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStream</span> 
 will have parsed through the string and will provide the arguments as 
 part of the method call. Once this has been done the correct derived class 
 can be instantiated at load time.</p>

<h2>Streaming and Access Flags</h2>

<p>If the application needs to adjust the create flags 
 on all data streams, this can be accomplished using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreamFactory</span> 
 callback mechanism. See <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="NiDataStream_Primer.htm#NiDataStreamFactory">NiDataStreamFactory</a></span> 
 for more details. </p>

<p>Additionally, data streams created with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_VOLATILE</span> 
 flag do not actually serialize their contents. It is assumed that the 
 volatile streams will be filled by a source at runtime. </p>

<h2>Optional Streaming of NiDataStream Objects and NiDataStreamRef 
 Objects</h2>

<p>In some situations, it is desirable to skip streaming 
 a particular data stream. A common use case is that the data stream is 
 always created by the application at runtime and its values can be derived 
 from other sources. To facilitate this use case, <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStreamRef.htm">NiDataStreamRef</a></span> 
 has a <span class="NDLSystemFont">Get/SetStreamabl</span>e API. Simply set 
 this value to false and the data stream will be skipped when saving. Note 
 that this can result in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreamRef</span> 
 indices for streams being in a different order than when the mesh was 
 created. For this reason, it is advisable to never stream out indices 
 of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreamRef</span> in the mesh and to 
 reconstruct the cached indices from semantic name/index pairs at runtime.</p>

<h2>Endianness</h2>

<p>As with all data structures streamed using Gamebryo's 
 streaming API, data is converted to the proper endian format upon load. 
 The key to this is properly describing the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="NiDataStream_Primer.htm#NiDataStreamElements">NiDataStreamElement</a></span> 
 objects contained within the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span>. 
 If elements are left out or combined together in binary blobs, it will 
 be impossible for the streaming system to ensure proper endian conversion.</p>

<h2>Precaching NiDataStream Objects</h2>

<p>One of the purposes of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> 
 objects is to represent platform-specific buffers that reside on the rendering 
 device. Depending on the platform, the streaming system may not be able 
 to allocate such resources because of multithreading considerations. As 
 a result, these buffers may be streamed into system memory and uploaded 
 to the rendering device at a later time, guaranteed to be no later than 
 when the mesh is rendered. To help ensure that this gets done sooner rather 
 than later, the streaming system can be set to automatically flag the 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> objects for precaching using 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderer::PrecacheMesh</span> as the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> is loaded. This behavior is enabled 
 or disabled through the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh::SetUsePreloading</span> 
 function. The default behavior is to have precaching enabled.</p>

<p>The details of how each renderer operates with regards 
 to precaching meshes can be found in the renderer-specific sections of 
 documentation.</p>
