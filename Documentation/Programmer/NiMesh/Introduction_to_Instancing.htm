<h1>Introduction to Instancing</h1>

<p>Hardware instancing is a feature that became available 
 with the release of shader model 3.0 graphics processor units (GPU). In 
 short, hardware instancing is a feature that allows large number of objects 
 to be rendered in a single draw call. Ideally, all graphics applications 
 should be GPU
 bound, but many graphics applications can be CPU bound. This can come from the 
 large amount of overhead involved in executing a single render call. Large 
 numbers of objects on screen result in a large number of render calls, 
 which can quickly destroy CPU performance. Hardware instancing helps fight 
 this problem. Instead of requiring one hundred draw calls to render the 
 same tree one hundred times, hardware instancing can be used and a single 
 draw call can be used to render the same hundred trees.</p>

<p>From a programmer's perspective, instancing allows the 
 GPU to use 
 different access patterns for different elements in streams of data. For 
 example, a stream containing vertex and transformation information can 
 be sampled at a per-vertex rate for vertices, with looping to handle overflow, 
 while the transformation elements can be sampled at a per-mesh rate. If 
 ten transforms are packed into a stream and the GPU
 is told to process ten times the number of vertices then ten copies of 
 an object can be rendered in a single draw call.</p>

<h2>How does hardware instancing work?</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, hardware instancing allows the GPU
 to iterate over separate data streams of a single mesh with different 
 access patterns. Lets consider the case where we have the following vertex 
 definition:</p>

<pre>
float3 position
float2 texCoord
float3 worldPosition
</pre> 

<p>As in most vertex definitions there is a position and 
 texture coordinate defined. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">position</span> 
 member represents the &nbsp;vertex 
 position in model space, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">texCoord</span> 
 member represents the texture coordinate to use when sampling a texture, 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont">worldPosition</span> 
 member is used to represent the world space position for the entire model. 
 Normally without using hardware instancing having the world position in 
 the vertex definition would not be needed. Instead, the world position 
 would be made available to the vertex shader by a shader constant. </p>

<p>In our case the first two components of the vertex definition, 
 position and <span class="NDLSystemFont">texCoord</span>, 
 will be stored in data stream <span class="NDLSystemFont">A</span>. The 
 third component, <span class="NDLSystemFont">worldPosition</span>, 
 is stored in a separate data stream, <span class="NDLSystemFont">B</span>. 
 Let's imagine that we want to render a single triangle 10 times using 
 hardware instancing. Data stream <span class="NDLSystemFont">A</span> would 
 contain 3 entries, one for each point in the triangle. Data stream <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">B</span> would contain 10 entries, one position or 
 transform for each instance. To render the ten triangles we issue a single 
 draw call. For each entry we have in data stream <span class="NDLSystemFont">B</span> 
 we will process all of the entries in data stream <span class="NDLSystemFont">A</span>. 
 This consumes one unique transformation for each pass over all the entries 
 in data stream <span class="NDLSystemFont">A</span>, so 10 triangles will 
 be rendered each one with a different transformation.</p>

<h2>Benefits of using hardware instancing</h2>

<p>The majority of the CPU time spent rendering geometry 
 comes from the overhead involved in each draw call. Normally only one 
 object is rendered per draw call, so rendering a scene with hundred of 
 objects will require hundreds of draw calls. This can quickly become the 
 application bottleneck due to the large amount of overhead involved in 
 each draw call. However, if many of the objects that are being drawn are 
 copies of the same mesh, or instances, and the platform supports hardware 
 instancing, then the entire scene can be rendered in only a few draw calls 
 instead of hundreds. Fewer draw calls results in less rendering overhead 
 on the CPU, freeing up the application to do other work. Hardware instancing 
 is ideal for situations where there are an large number of objects that 
 need to be rendered with only a few unique meshes. An asteroid field is 
 a good example of a scene that is ideal for hardware instancing.</p>

<h2>Pitfalls of using hardware instancing</h2>

<p>As with all things, hardware instancing does not come 
 for free. While using hardware instancing can greatly reduce the amount 
 of CPU work required to render a scene, it increases the amount of GPU 
 work that needs to be done. As described above, hardware instancing requires 
 the world transforms to be packed into the vertex structure. This data 
 takes up additional GPU bandwidth and on some platforms requires additional 
 cycles just to access. Luckily, in most situations the benefits gained 
 on the CPU side far out weigh the extra cost on the GPU.</p>

<h2>More information</h2>

<p>Hardware instancing is best for rendering large numbers 
 of static objects. However, like everything else, this solution does not 
 come for free and has some draw backs that users should know about before 
 turning on hardware instancing. More information about hardware instancing
