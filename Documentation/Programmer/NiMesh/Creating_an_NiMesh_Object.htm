<h1>Creating an NiMesh Object</h1>

<p>This document is intended to address the most common 
 method for creating an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh </span>programmatically. 
 This document does not address <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> 
 creation in detail, but this topic is addressed in the <a href="NiDataStream_Primer.htm">NiDataStream 
 Primer</a> topic. </p>

<p>The <a href="../../Learn/Demos/Introduction_to_the_MeshCreation_Demo.htm">MeshCreation 
 Demo</a> provides a working sample of the techniques discussed in this 
 article.</p>

<a name=Manual_NiMesh_Construction></a><h2>Programmatic NiMesh 
 Construction</h2>

<p>This section will explore the creation of a single triangle 
 based mesh with vertex positions, normals, and an index buffer. The resulting 
 mesh could be further optimized by interleaving the positions and normals; 
 however, such behavior is beyond the scope of this document. While possible 
 with code, the <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Available_Tool_Plug_ins.htm">Finalize 
 tool plug-in</a> is generally responsible for this level of optimization.</p>

<p>First, a new mesh is created and its primitive type 
 is set to triangles.</p>

<pre>
NiMesh* pkMesh = NiNew NiMesh();
pkMesh-&gt;SetPrimitiveType(NiPrimitiveType::PRIMITIVE_TRIANGLES);
</pre> 


<p>Next, stream and element references need to be created 
 for each of the desired data streams (positions, normals, and indices). 
 This is achieved using a method on <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span>.</p>

<pre>
NiDataStream* pkDataStream = NULL;
 
// Create the element reference.
pkDataStream = NiDataStream::CreateSingleElementDataStream(
    NiDataStreamElement::F_FLOAT32_3,   
    uiNumVerts,
    NiDataStream::ACCESS_CPU_READ | NiDataStream::ACCESS_GPU_READ | 
    NiDataStream::ACCESS_CPU_WRITE_STATIC,
    NiDataStream::USAGE_VERTEX,
    pkVerts); 
 
NIASSERT(pkDataStream != NULL); 
 
// Create the stream reference and add to the mesh's array of NiStreamRef's. 
// Note, the data stream created earlier is stored on the stream reference.
pkMesh-&gt;AddStreamRef(pkDataStream , NiCommonSemantics::POSITION(), 0); 
</pre>

<p>The above code illustrates the creation of the positions 
 data stream. The variables containing the data are assumed to already 
 exist, namely <span class="NDLSystemFont">uiNumVerts</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">pkVerts</span>. 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> does not take ownership 
 of pkVerts and it is still the application's responsibility to delete 
 any data it allocates.</p>

<p>This particular example enables the CPU to have access 
 to the stream after it is created (<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::ACCESS_CPU_READ</span>), 
 the GPU to have access to the stream for rendering (<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::ACCESS_GPU_READ</span>), 
 and the CPU to only write to the data once (<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::ACCESS_CPU_WRITE_STATIC</span>).</p>

<p>The same code could be repeated for creating vertex 
 normals with the exception of using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiCommonSemantics::NORMAL</span> 
 semantic, however, an alternative method exists to simplify the creation 
 and addition of a stream to a mesh. Rather than creating a stream and 
 adding a reference to it in separate calls, a user can simply call <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">AddStream</span> on the mesh. An example is provided 
 below.</p>

<pre>
pkMesh-&gt;AddStream(
    NiCommonSemantics::NORMAL(),
    0,
    NiDataStreamElement::F_FLOAT32_3,
    uiNumVerts,
    NiDataStream::ACCESS_CPU_READ | NiDataStream::ACCESS_GPU_READ |   
    NiDataStream::ACCESS_CPU_WRITE_STATIC,
    NiDataStream::USAGE_VERTEX,   
    pkNormals);
</pre>

<p>If it is undesirable to pass in the vertex data as a 
 contiguous array to <span class="NDLSystemFont">AddStream</span> (for example, 
 because it would require copying data to a temporary buffer), the application 
 should initialize the NiDataStream object post-creation using an <a href="Data_Stream_Lock_and_Iterator_Objects.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreamElementLock</span> object</a> obtained 
 from<span class="NDLSystemFont"> NiMesh::AddStreamGetLock</span>. </p>

<p>Now an index buffer must be created in order to reuse 
 vertices when defining triangles. The following code assumes the CPU side 
 index buffer variable has already been created with valid values.</p>

<pre>
pkDataStream = NiDataStream::CreateSingleElementDataStream(
      NiDataStreamElement::F_UINT16_1,
      uiNumIndices,
          NiDataStream::ACCESS_GPU_READ | NiDataStream::ACCESS_CPU_WRITE_STATIC,
          NiDataStream::USAGE_VERTEX_INDEX,
      pusIndices);
   
NIASSERT(pkDataStream != NULL);
</pre>
 
<p>Note that this code is almost identical to the code 
 used to create vertex element data streams. The only difference is the 
 enumeration <span class="NDLSystemFont">USAGE_VERTEX_INDEX</span> instead 
 of <span class="NDLSystemFont">USAGE_VERTEX</span>. This tells the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> API that the stream represents an index 
 buffer. Also note, the sample code created a 16-bit index buffer. This 
 limits the number of vertices to 65,536. This is not an innate limitation 
 of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh </span>API. If more vertices are 
 required, the index buffer can contain 32-bit indices in which case the 
 data type would have been <span class="NDLSystemFont">F_UINT32_1</span> 
 instead of <span class="NDLSystemFont">F_UINT16_1</span>.</p>

<p>The next step is to bind the index buffer stream to 
 the mesh.</p>

<pre>
pkMesh-&gt;AddStreamRef(pkDataStream, NiCommonSemantics::INDEX(), 0);
</pre> 

<p>At this point, the mesh is almost created. The number 
 of sub-meshes that exist still needs to be defined and the mesh's bounds 
 need to be re-computed. </p>

<pre>
pkMesh-&gt;SetSubmeshCount(1);
pkMesh-&gt;RecomputeBounds(); 
</pre> 

<p>Since there is a continuous index buffer on the mesh 
 and no complicated materials or skin partitions, it is only necessary 
 to have a single sub-mesh. There could be more sub-meshes if there were 
 additional partitions or if there are several strips in a stripified mesh.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that <span class="NDLSystemFont">RecomputeBounds</span> 
 uses the <span class="NDLSystemFont">POSITION</span> vertex attribute and 
 if that stream is absent or is not accessible for a CPU read lock, the 
 bound computation will fail. In this scenario, it is still possible to 
 set the bound directly using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetModelBound</span> 
 method.</p>
