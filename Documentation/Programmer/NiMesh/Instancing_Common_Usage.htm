<h1>Instancing Common Usage</h1>

<p>In general, there are only a few different situations 
 where an application should use hardware instancing. This section attempts 
 to cover these common use cases and describe which instancing options 
 should be used for each.</p>

<h2>Many sparsely packed static objects</h2>

<p>Imagine a scene with large a number of static instanced 
 objects spaced all through out the level, such as a forest. In this situation 
 there will most likely be instances surrounding the camera in all directions. 
 This means that the bounding volume for the instanced mesh will likely 
 always be visible, eliminating the possibility of culling out all the 
 instances in one pass. For this situation, making use of per-instance culling 
 would be ideal. This will ensure that only the visible instances are passed 
 to the GPU.</p>

<p>Another important detail to note is that the location 
 of all the geometry is static. We can take advantage of this fact and 
 help save resources. Instead of using <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshHWInstance.htm">NiMeshHWInstance</a> 
 objects to help manage the transformations of the instances, the transformations 
 can be manually set and then never touched again. Avoiding using <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshHWInstance</span> objects can greatly reduce 
 the amount of memory required to manage the instance objects as well as 
 help reduce memory fragmentation. </p>

<h2>Many densely packed static objects</h2>

<p>Imagine a scene with a large number of static instanced 
 objects spaced near each other, such as a brick wall were each brick is 
 an instance. In this scenario, the bounding volume that represents all 
 the instanced meshes will only be visible when some of the instances are 
 visible. When the bounding volume is visible its very likely that the 
 majority of the instances are visible as well. For this case, only one 
 pass of culling should be necessary, as performing per-instance culling 
 would likely not provide much of a benefit. </p>

<p>Similar to the sparsely packed static scene, there is 
 not much need to use <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshHWInstance.htm">NiMeshHWInstance</a> 
 objects for a densely packed static scene, or any other static scene. 
 Instead the transformations should be set manually. Avoiding using <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshHWInstance</span> objects can greatly reduce 
 the amount of memory required to manage the instance objects as well as 
 help reduce memory fragmentation. </p>

<h2>Many dynamic objects</h2>

<p>What fun is a brick wall constructed of hundreds of 
 brick instances if the bricks cannot move? A little more care needs to 
 be used for scenes that will have instances with changing transformations. 
 When the transform for an instance changes the bounding volume for the 
 instanced mesh needs to be recomputed. This can be a rather expensive 
 operation, especially when the instanced mesh represents thousands of 
 instances. To avoid having to recompute the bounding volume every time 
 a transformation is changed simply specify the bounding volume to be static. 
 Since, setting the bounding volume to static can result in incorrect bounds 
 and culling, care needs to be taken when switching to static bounds. If 
 the transformations of the instances are going to change greatly it may 
 be better to not use static bounds or possibly use a static bound that 
 is large enough to encapsulate the entire area that any of the instances 
 may move too.</p>
