<h1>Mesh Modifier Execution Model</h1>

<p>Mesh modifiers are designed to execute in parallel with 
 other engine tasks using the <a href="../NiFloodgate/Introduction_to_NiFloodgate.htm">Floodgate</a> 
 library, although it is certainly possible to create modifiers the execute 
 serially.</p>

<p>Execution uses a parallel task submission model, with 
 the main application loop calling on modifiers to submit parallel update 
 tasks that are completed and synchronized at later points. Modifier implementations 
 provide the code to compute the task and the functions to submit and complete 
 the tasks. <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span> 
 objects contain the logic that controls when the modifier functions are 
 called.</p>

<p>The modifier can perform any form of computation on 
 the mesh to which it is attached. Due to their focus on parallelism, tasks 
 that fit into the Floodgate kernel model are best suited to modifiers. 
 However, there is no requirement to use Floodgate in a modifier - the 
 modifier can be treated as a serial computation step invoked at pre-defined 
 points as the mesh object is moved through the system.</p>

<h2>NiMeshModifier Functions</h2>

<p>Two functions in the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshModifier.htm">NiMeshModifier</a></span> 
 class are used to control execution at run-time:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshModifier.htm#Updating_and_Managing_Parallel_Tasks">SubmitTasks</a></span> 
 is called whenever the modifier indicates that it would like to start 
 parallel tasks. A task is a chunk of work that corresponds to a Floodgate 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../NiFloodgate/Floodgate_Specifying_Tasks.htm">NiSPTask</a></span> 
 object. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">SubmitTasks</span> function can 
 also be used to do serial work, including any per-invocation work that 
 must be done to set up the task.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshModifier.htm#Updating_and_Managing_Parallel_Tasks">CompleteTasks</a></span> 
 is called when the modifier is required to complete parallel tasks that 
 it has started executing. In other words, it is the synchronization function. 
 In addition to waiting on Floodgate to <a href="../NiFloodgate/Floodgate_Workflow_Completion_Monitoring.htm">complete</a> 
 the relevant tasks, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CompleteTasks</span> 
 function may perform additional serial processing, or the function may 
 do serial processing alone.</li>
</ul>

<p>The use of Floodgate means that much of the runtime 
 functionality of modifiers resides in <a href="../NiFloodgate/Floodgate_Programming_Kernels.htm">kernel 
 functions</a> and makes heavy use of stream processing.</p>

<p>See <a href="Creating_a_Custom_Mesh_Modifier.htm">Creating 
 a Custom Mesh Modifier</a> for more information on defining the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">SubmitTasks</span> function and the <span class="NDLSystemFont">CompleteTasks</span> 
 function.</p>

<h2>SyncPoints</h2>

<p>The execution points at which the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SubmitTasks</span> 
 function and <span class="NDLSystemFont">CompleteTasks</span> function are 
 called are determined by a set of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiSyncArgs.htm">SyncPoints</a></span> 
 that the modifier registers for, one set for submission and one for completion. 
 The <span class="NDLSystemFont">SubmitTasks</span> function will be called 
 at every submit sync point the modifier is registered for, and the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">CompleteTasks</span> function will be called for every 
 complete sync point registered. For example:</p>


<div class="NDLFigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/SyncPoints.png" width="482" height="101"
/>
    <!-- <p class="NDLFigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
</div>

<p>As shown above, each sync point corresponds to a particular 
 stage in per-frame processing. The following sync points are pre-defined 
 in the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiSyncArgs.htm">NiSyncArgs</a></span> 
 class and have meanings consistent across all Gamebryo applications:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_UPDATE</span>: 
 The <span class="NDLSystemFont">SubmitTasks</span> function or <span class="NDLSystemFont">CompleteTasks</span> 
 function will be called during the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> 
 to an object. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CompleteTasks</span> function 
 is called immediately upon entering the object's update function, while 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SubmitTasks</span> function is called after 
 the object's time controllers have been updated but before the new world 
 pose and bound are computed for the object. As a result, modifiers using 
 this sync point or <span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_POST_UPDATE</span> should 
 compute the world transform or world bounds if they are needed.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_POST_UPDATE</span>: 
 This sync point also invokes functions during update, exactly as with 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_UPDATE</span>, but any Floodgate tasks 
 submitted by the modifier are postponed until the entire scene graph finishes 
 update.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_VISIBLE</span>: 
 The <span class="NDLSystemFont">SubmitTasks</span> function or <span class="NDLSystemFont">CompleteTasks</span> 
 function will be called in the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh::OnVisible</a></span> 
 function when an object is determined to be visible, inside the culling 
 phase. Use this sync point to begin tasks that only need to be done if 
 the object will be rendered.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_RENDER</span>: 
 This sync point is only used for completion. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CompleteTasks</span> 
 function is invoked in the <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh::RenderImmediate</span></a> function (i.e. 
 when the object is about to be rendered).</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional sync points for physics simulation synchronization 
 are also defined in the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiSyncArgs.htm">NiSyncArgs</a></span> 
 class. The Gamebryo-PhysX integration makes use of these, and other physics 
 packages may also use them. It is the physics integration's responsibility 
 to submit and complete modifiers with these synchronization points.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_PHYSICS_SIMULATE</span></li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_PHYSICS_COMPLETED</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The special sync point <span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_ANY</span> 
 is used to indicate that action should be taken for any sync points that 
 the modifier supports. For example, it is used as the completion sync 
 point when all the tasks that were submitted at a given sync point must 
 be finished.</p>

<p>Sync points are 16-bit unsigned integer identifiers. 
 Applications can define their own and make calls to submit or complete 
 modifiers at customized execution points. Gamebryo reserves values higher 
 than 0x7FFF for internal use (values with the highest-order bit set to 
 1).</p>

<p>Gamebryo's pre-defined modifiers provide some examples 
 of the use of sync points:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>The <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiInstancingMeshModifier.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiInstancingMeshModifier</span></a> class uses a submit 
 sync point of <span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_UPDATE</span> to do some 
 serial processing. It uses <span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_VISIBLE</span> 
 to submit Floodgate tasks that perform the instance culling. These tasks 
 are completed at sync point <span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_RENDER</span> 
 so that the results are available for rendering.</li>
	
	<li>The <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMorphMeshModifier.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMorphMeshModifier</span></a> class submits tasks 
 either at <span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_POST_UPDATE</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_UPDATE</span>, 
 or &nbsp;<span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_VISIBLE 
 </span>depending on whether the morphed object is respectively also skinned 
 in software, always updated, or neither. Tasks are completed on <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_VISIBLE</span> if the object is software skinned, 
 otherwise <span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_RENDER</span>. These particular 
 sync points are chosen to maximize the time available for processing while 
 minimizing wasted work and ensuring that the modifier works with skinning.</li>
	
	<li>The <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiSkinningMeshModifier.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiSkinningMeshModifier</span></a> class submits a 
 bone matrix updating task at <span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_POST_UPDATE</span> 
 (so that all of the bone transforms in a scene graph will have been set 
 when the task runs) and this task is completed at <span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_RENDER</span>. 
 If software skinning, the first task is completed at <span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_VISIBLE</span> 
 and the task to actually perform software skinning is submitted to be 
 completed at <span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_RENDER</span>.</li>
	
	<li>Particle systems submit 
 tasks at <span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_UPDATE</span> to be completed 
 at <span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_VISIBLE</span>, at which time the task 
 to construct the particle geometry is submitted for completion at <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_RENDER</span>.</li>
</ul>
