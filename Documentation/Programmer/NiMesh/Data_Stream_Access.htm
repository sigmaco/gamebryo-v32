<h1>Data Stream Access</h1>

<p>Because of thread safety and GPU synchronization concerns, 
 all access to the data within an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> 
 is protected by a <span class="NDLSystemFont">Lock/Unlock</span> API.</p>

<a name=AccessFlags></a><h2>NiDataStream Access Flags</h2>

<p>The contents of an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> 
 are guaranteed to be accessed in a thread-safe manner. This means that 
 when one thread is accessing the vertex data for read, it cannot be simultaneously 
 written to in another thread. In general, it is safe for two threads to 
 read the same data simultaneously as long as no writers are present. However, 
 since efficiency is of the utmost importance, it is necessary for a user 
 to declare how the data stream will be accessed when it is created. These 
 flags are defined in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::Access</span> 
 enumeration. Since the renderers know how the data is going to be potentially 
 accessed at creation time, it can choose the best implementation of the 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> interface, in some cases 
 eliminating expensive thread safety primitives entirely.</p>

<h4>CPU-readable NiDataStream details</h4>

<p>In order to declare that the application wishes to access 
 the data, it is necessary to declare <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_READ</span> 
 access on an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span>. Note that 
 this flag is incompatible with <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_VOLATILE.</span></p>

<h4>CPU-writable NiDataStream details</h4>

<p>CPU-writable data streams are created with one of three 
 possible <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE</span> access flags: <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_STATIC</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_VOLATILE</span>, 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_MUTABLE</span>. The meaning of 
 these flags is discussed below.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_STATIC</span> 
  The stream may be locked for CPU write only once. Any subsequent write 
 locks will fail. Reading from the data stream is thus inherently thread 
 safe because the contents will not change after the initial write.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_VOLATILE</span> 
  The stream may be locked for CPU write multiple times. Data is not preserved 
 from lock to lock. The entire contents must written upon locking and must 
 be written every frame. This access mode is incompatible with CPU read 
 access.
	
	<ul>
		
		<li>There is no requirement 
 that locking a data stream enforce dependencies within a single frame 
 between NiMesh objects that share that volatile data stream.</li>
		
		<li>Volatile data streams 
 should generally not be shared. If shared, a lock and render, lock and 
 render paradigm should be used. If such ordering is not used, the volatile 
 data written to a buffer during the first lock may be overwritten by subsequent 
 operations resulting in incorrect rendering behavior.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_MUTABLE</span> 
  The stream may be locked for CPU write multiple times. Contents are 
 preserved from lock to lock. Contents may be written sparsely or incompletely. 
 This lock type will generally be the slowest as it has the most stringent 
 runtime requirements. If using this type, make sure that it is not being 
 changed every frame, as this can have severe performance impact.</li>
</ul>

<h4>GPU-readable NiDataStream details</h4>

<p>In order to declare that a data stream's contents should 
 be available to the GPU for reading, it is necessary to declare <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">GPU_READ</span> access on an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span>. 
 Each renderer can implement CPU/GPU synchronization as appropriate to 
 their respective API's.</p>

<h4>GPU-writable NiDataStream details</h4>

<p>While it is possible to specify this flag, GPU_WRITE 
 access is currently unsupported on all platforms.</p>


<h4>Thread Safety and NiDataStream Access Flags</h4>

<p>Depending on the access flags specified at construction, 
 the required thread-safety enforcement mechanism varies. The following 
 table illustrates this for valid combinations of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> 
 access flags, with discussion below.</p>

<p>1) Since the CPU never reads this data, no CPU synchronization 
 is required. However, since the GPU may be reading the data when the data 
 is copied from CPU addressable memory to GPU addressable memory, platform 
 specific synchronization is required.</p>

<p>2) Note that this combination is never accessed by the 
 GPU. In this case, synchronization is required between multiple threads 
 on the CPU. All current implementations block if the data is being accessed 
 from a separate thread.</p>

<p>3) This scenario requires both CPU access and GPU access. 
 Synchronization is required between multiple CPU threads accessing the 
 data. When the data needs to be copied from CPU addressable memory to 
 GPU addressable memory, platform specific synchronization is required.</p>

<a name=LockFlags></a><h2>NiDataStream Lock Flags</h2>

<p>Once an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> 
 has been created, it will need to have its data populated. If this is 
 done on the CPU, it will be necessary to call Lock on the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span>. 
 This call takes an arbitrary configuration of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::LockType</span> 
 values to describe how the application intends to use the contents of 
 the data buffer. If the data stream was not created to support those flags, 
 it will fail to lock the stream and return NULL. The following list outlines 
 the possible lock type flags:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">LOCK_CPU_READ</span>&mdash;The CPU is requesting to read the memory. <span class="NDLSystemFont">ACCESS_CPU_READ</span> 
 must have been specified on creation for this to return a non-NULL value.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">LOCK_CPU_WRITE</span>&mdash;The CPU is requesting to write the memory. <span class="NDLSystemFont">ACCESS_CPU_WRITE</span> 
 must have been specified on creation for this to return a non-NULL value.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">LOCK_TOOL_READ</span>&mdash;If the data stream is an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiToolDataStream</span> 
 object, then the memory should be returned. If the data stream is not 
 an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiToolDataStream</span>, the return is NULL.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont">LOCK_TOOL_WRITE</span>&mdash;If the data stream is an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiToolDataStream</span> 
 object, then the memory should be returned. If the data stream is not 
 an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiToolDataStream</span>, the return is NULL.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that two flags, <span class="NDLSystemFont">LOCK_TOOL_READ</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">LOCK_TOOL_WRITE</span>, are added to maintain 
 consistent behavior across all types of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> 
 objects of locking with a particular <span class="NDLSystemFont">LockType</span>. 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">LOCK_TOOL_READ</span> and <span class="NDLSystemFont">LOCK_TOOL_WRITE</span> 
 allow <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiToolDataStream</span> objects to be 
 locked for read or write even if the corresponding <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_READ</span> 
 or <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE</span> access flag was not specified. 
 </p>

<h4>Lock Mixing</h4>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> clients 
 may not know ahead of time if data stream elements being accessed reside 
 in a single data stream or across multiple data streams. For example, 
 client code may want to read "positions" and write "normals". &nbsp;If 
 "positions" and "normals" are in the same data stream, the data stream 
 must be locked for read and write. To &nbsp;facilitate 
 this, the Lock mechanism must support intermixed read and write locks. 
 The details: </p>

<ul>
	
	<li>A data stream locked 
 for <span class="NDLSystemFont">LOCK_WRITE</span> may be later locked for 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">LOCK_READ</span> from the same thread, but not 
 vice versa. 
 </li>
	
	<li>Intermixed locks are 
 supported for <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_MUTABLE</span> data 
 streams only since <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_STATIC</span> implies 
 no writing and <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_VOLATILE</span> implies 
 no reading.</li>
	
	<li>In order to properly 
 track outstanding locks by type, a lock mask argument is passed into the 
 unlock method.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lock failure handling</h4>

<p>A method, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::IsRequestValid</span>, 
 is provided to test whether or not the parameters specified represent 
 a valid Lock request. <span class="NDLSystemFont">IsRequestValid</span> 
 is called internally by <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> 
 whenever Lock is called, and Lock will return NULL if validation fails.</p>

<p>For example, calling Lock for <span class="NDLSystemFont">LOCK_CPU_WRITE</span> 
 on a read-only buffer will return NULL.</p>
