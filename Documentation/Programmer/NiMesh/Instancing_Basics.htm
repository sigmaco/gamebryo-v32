<h1>Instancing Basics</h1>

<p>Gamebryo<!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 provides an API to allow applications to make use of hardware instancing 
 support. The majority of this API exists inside the <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiInstancingUtilities.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiInstancingUtilities</span><!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--></a> 
 class. Applications that wish to make use of Gamebryo's<!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 hardware instancing support need to verify that the executing platform 
 supports hardware instancing, enable hardware instancing on the desired 
 meshes, and provide the transforms for the instances.</p>

<p>When hardware instancing for a mesh is enabled, that 
 mesh changes from representing a single visible object to multiple visible 
 objects, instances. This can lead to some confusion on how to work with 
 the multiple instances that the single mesh represents. To help manage 
 this process the <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshHWInstance.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshHWInstance</span></a><!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 class can be used to create placeholder nodes in the scene graph to represent 
 the location of an instanced mesh. More information about using the <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshHWInstance.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshHWInstance</span></a><!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 class can be found below. </p>

<h2>Instancing Options</h2>

<p>Applications using hardware instancing have two main 
 areas of flexibility: transforms and culling. How the application works 
 with these options will have a large impact on the resources consumed 
 by the instanced mesh.</p>

<h4>Transforms:</h4>

<p>There are two ways applications can define the transforms 
 for the instances of an instanced mesh. Either <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshHWInstance.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshHWInstance</span></a><!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 objects can be placed through out the scene graph to act as place holders 
 for the mesh instances or the instance transforms can be provided directly.</p>

<p>A <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshHWInstance.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshHWInstance</span><!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--></a> 
 object is essentially an <a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiAVObject.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span><!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--></a> 
 that references an instanced mesh. Using <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshHWInstance.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshHWInstance</span></a><!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 objects has the advantage of allowing applications to work with mesh instances 
 in a manner that is similar to other scene graph objects, instead of having 
 to manually manage the transformations of each instance. When a <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshHWInstance.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshHWInstance</span></a><!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 object is placed in the scene graph it inherits the transformations of 
 its parent node. Any time a <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshHWInstance.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshHWInstance</span></a><!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 object's transformations are changed, the instanced mesh it represents 
 is notified, and the instance transforms stored by the instanced mesh will 
 be updated. <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshHWInstance.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshHWInstance</span></a><!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 objects are ideal for scenes with complex scene graphs and changing transforms.</p>

<p>Instead of using <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshHWInstance.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshHWInstance</span><!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--></a> 
 objects to represent the transforms of the instanced meshes, they can 
 be manually managed by the application and passed directly to the instanced 
 mesh. While this method can require more work on the application's side 
 to manage transforms, it eliminates the need to have large numbers of 
 <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshHWInstance.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshHWInstance</span><!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--></a> 
 objects existing. Manually providing the instance transformations is ideal 
 for scenes with shallow scene graphs and static transformations.</p>

<h4>Culling:</h4>

<p>Since hardware instancing causes a single mesh to represent 
 multiple meshes, care is required when determining the best way for an 
 application to handle culling. The bounding volume stored on an instanced 
 mesh contains the bounds of all the instances represented by that mesh. 
 In order for the instanced mesh to be culled none of the instances can 
 be visible. Even if only one of the instances is visible all of the instances 
 will be rendered. In some cases it is even possible to have no instances 
 visible and still have the instanced mesh rendered, such as looking between 
 the grid lines of a grid of instanced meshes. For scenes where all the 
 instances are clustered together, this is not a problem. However, for scenes 
 where the instances are not close to each other, this can result in large 
 amounts of unneeded data being executed by the GPU<!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}-->.</p>

<p>Support for per instance culling is available to address 
 this problem. Two culling passes will be executed on the mesh when per 
 instance culling is enabled. The first culling pass is described above; 
 the bound that contains all of the instances will be used as a quick check 
 to see if all the instances can be culled. If any portion of this large 
 bounding volume is visible, then the second culling pass will be initiated. 
 The second culling pass performs the culling on a per instance level so 
 only the visible instances are sent to the GPU for rendering. One problem 
 with performing culling on a per instance level is simply the large number 
 of instances that will need culled. With hardware instancing, it is possible 
 to render thousands of objects at once in real-time.  However, performing culling 
 on this many objects is not a trivial task. To help mitigate this cost 
 the <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiInstancingMeshModifier.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiInstancingMeshModifier</span></a><!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 uses <a href="../NiFloodgate/Introduction_to_NiFloodgate.htm">Floodgate</a> 
 to parallelize<!--kadov_tag{{</ignored>}}--> 
 the culling processes across available processors.</p>

<p>Another way to reduce the amount of culling work required 
 is to set the instanced mesh's bounding volume to be static. When a dynamic 
 bounding volume is used, the bounding volume for the instanced mesh will 
 need to be updated any time new instance transforms are provided or the 
 location of a <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshHWInstance.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshHWInstance</span></a> object is changed. The 
 process of updating this bounding volume can be time consuming, especially 
 if a large number of instances exist. Setting the bounding volume to static 
 eliminates the need to update the bounding volume.</p>

<h2>Using Hardware instancing</h2>

<p>The process of using Gamebryo's hardware instancing 
 support can be broken down into three parts. First, the application needs 
 to check for hardware instancing support. Second, it needs to enable hardware 
 instancing on the desires <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span></a> objects, and finally it will need 
 to update the transformations of the instances.</p>

<p>Support for hardware instancing can be determined by 
 querying the <a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiRenderer.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiRenderer</span></a> capability bits via <span class="NDLSystemFont">GetFlags()</span>. 
 The following code from the MeshInstancing sample properly queries the 
 renderer for hardware instancing support:</p>

<pre>
if ( !(NiRenderer::GetRenderer()-&gt;GetFlags() &amp;
    NiRenderer::CAPS_HARDWAREINSTANCING) )
{
    NiMessageBox("The current hardware does not support hardware "
        "instancing. Use of hardware instancing will be disabled in this "
        "sample.",
        "Warning - Hardware instancing not supported.");
    m_bHardwareInstancing = false;
}
</pre>
 
<p>To enable hardware instancing for a <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span></a> the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiInstancingUtilities.htm#Public_Static_Methods">NiInstancingUtilities::EnableMeshInstancing()</a></span> 
 method should be used. This method has a large number of parameters that 
 let you specify many of the options discussed above along with some others. 
 One key detail about this method is that, depending on the platform, it 
 may be required to duplicate index data. This requires either the mesh's 
 index data to be created with the flag <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm#Public_Methods"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::ACCESS_CPU_READ</span></a> or for the 
 index data to be passed directly into the <span class="NDLSystemFont">EnableMeshInstancing()</span> 
 method. More information about the renderer specific requirements can 
 be found in the <a href="Instancing_Renderer_Support.htm">renderer support</a> 
 section.</p>

<p>After hardware instancing has been enabled on a mesh, 
 the transforms for the different instances need to be specified. As described 
 above, this can be done in one of two ways. Either the transforms can 
 be explicitly set or they can be specified via <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshHWInstance.htm"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshHWInstance</span></a> objects. Manually setting 
 the instance transforms can simply be done by calling <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiInstancingUtilities.htm#Public_Static_Methods"><span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiInstancingUtilities::SetInstanceTransformations()</span></a>. 
 If <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshHWInstance</span> objects are used 
 instead, then after the objects are created they will need to be assigned 
 to the instanced mesh they are representing, and then finally placed in 
 the scene graph. Assuming <span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spScene</span> is 
 a valid smart pointer to a <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode, m_spInstancedMesh</span> 
 is a valid pointer to a <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> object, 
 and we wish to instance <span class="NDLSystemFont">m_spInstancedMesh</span> 
 500 times, the following code is an example of how this would be done:</p>

<pre>
NiInstancingUtilities::EnableMeshInstancing(m_spInstancedMesh, 500);
 
for (NiUInt32 ui = 0; ui &lt; 500; ui++)
{
NiMeshInstance* pkInstanceNode = NiNew NiMeshHWInstance();
NiInstancingUtilities::AddMeshInstance(m_spInstancedMesh, pkInstanceNode);
m_spScene-&gt;AttachChild(pkInstanceNode);
}
</pre> 

<h2>Unsupported systems</h2>

<p>The following systems are not fully compatible with 
 hardware instancing:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>NiAnimation</li>
	
	<li>NiCollision</li>
	
	<li>NiPhysX</li>
</ul>

<p>These systems may still be provided scenes with instanced 
 meshes, but they will operate on the mesh as if it is a single object.
