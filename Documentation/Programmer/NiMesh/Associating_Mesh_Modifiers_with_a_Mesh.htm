<h1>Associating Mesh Modifiers with a Mesh</h1>

<p>There are two aspects to associating a modifier with 
 a mesh object. First, the modifier can be added to the list of modifiers 
 on the mesh using the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm#Public_NiMeshModifier_Helper_Methods">NiMesh::AddModifier</a></span> 
 or <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm#Public_NiMeshModifier_Helper_Methods">NiMesh::AddModifierAt</a></span> 
 functions. In their simplest form, with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">bAttach</span> 
 argument false, these functions store the modifier as belonging to the 
 mesh but do not do the work required to prepare the modifier for execution. 
 Second, the modifier can be <em>attached</em> 
 to the mesh. Attachment prepares the modifier for execution by setting 
 pointers into data streams on the mesh. The two processes, adding and 
 attaching, are separated because it is undesirable to attach a modifier 
 to a mesh before the streams and other data on the mesh have been finalized 
 for execution.</p>

<p>In most cases the attachment of modifiers will be transparent 
 to an application, unless the application is explicitly creating modifiers 
 in code. The modifier is attached when:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>The modifier is added 
 to the mesh and the <span class="NDLSystemFont">bAttach</span> argument 
 is <span class="NDLSystemFont">true</span>.</li>
	
	<li>The modifier is streamed 
 from a NIF file (in the post-link stage of streaming).</li>
	
	<li>The modifier is created 
 as part of back-compatibility conversion from an old asset.</li>
	
	<li><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh::AttachModifier</a></span> 
 is explicitly called with the modifier as its argument.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from some housekeeping in <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh::AttachModifier</span>, 
 &nbsp;the virtual 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshModifier.htm">NiMeshModifier::Attach</a></span> 
 method is intended to perform the bulk of the work of attachment. Modifier 
 sub-classes always implement this function.</p>

<p>The modifier can only be attached if the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshModifier.htm#Querying_Requirements">NiMeshModifier::AreRequirementMet</a></span> 
 function returns <span class="NDLSystemFont">true</span>. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">AreRequirementMet 
 </span>function checks that the modifier can successfully execute on the 
 mesh. When morph mesh modifiers are changed or attached <span class="NDLSystemFont">CalculateMorphBound 
 </span>should be called before the next <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> 
 call.</p>

<h2>NiMeshModifier::Attach</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshModifier.htm">NiMeshModifier::Attach</a></span> 
 method must be called before the modifier is able to execute. It typically 
 performs the following actions:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Set the submit and 
 complete sync points for the modifier. It is safe to wait until the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> method to set these because the modifier 
 will never be called to submit tasks before it is attached. It is advantageous 
 to wait until <span class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> so that the mesh 
 has had all of its modifiers added and all of its parameters set. The 
 data on the mesh can therefore be used to choose appropriate submission 
 and completion points. For example, the morphing modifier looks for and 
 makes use of any skinning modifier on the mesh.</li>
	
	<li>Cache pointers to data 
 on the mesh. For example, look up and store a pointer to a particular 
 data stream. It is not safe to do this before <span class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> 
 is called because some other process may change the pointer. After <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> has been called it is guaranteed that 
 the mesh's data stream layout will not change again. The modifier will 
 be detached and re-attached if the data does change.</li>
	
	<li>Create Floodgate streams 
 and tasks. <span class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> is the right place 
 to do this for the reasons outlined above: all data about the mesh is 
 known and pointers will not change without notification.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> method can 
 also do any one-off initialization work for the modifier.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> method must 
 <b>not</b>
 add or change data stream 
 references on the mesh. It is a pre-condition of attachment that the mesh 
 is in its ready-to-execute state. If one modifier was to add data during 
 attachment, the pre-condition may be violated for the other modifiers 
 on the mesh. It is safe to change the data in the stream, but nothing 
 about the stream itself.</p>

<h2>NiMeshModifier::Detach</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshModifier.htm">NiMeshModifier::Detach</a></span> 
 method must undo anything done in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> 
 method, such as releasing pointers and deleting allocated objects. The 
 sequence of calls <span class="NDLSystemFont">Attach - Detach - Attach</span> 
 should give identical results to a single <span class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> 
 call, and no leaked memory.</p>

<p>It is safe to assume that <span class="NDLSystemFont">CompleteTasks</span> 
 has been called on the modifier before <span class="NDLSystemFont">Detach</span> 
 is called, so there will be no outstanding Floodgate tasks.</p>

<h2>NiMeshModifier::AreRequirementsMet</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshModifier.htm#Querying_Requirements">NiMeshModifier::AreRequirementMet</a></span> 
 function must be implemented by all modifier classes. It is used to query 
 the ability of a modifier to execute on a mesh. For example, the mesh 
 should be checked for all of the data streams required by the modifier, 
 and that those streams have the necessary format and level of access.</p>

<h2>NiMesh::ResetModifiers</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh::ResetModifiers</a></span> 
 function should be called for any mesh when the data streams on it are 
 added, removed or otherwise changed in a way that might invalidate the 
 data referenced by modifiers on the mesh. It causes all modifiers to be 
 detached and then attached again.</p>
