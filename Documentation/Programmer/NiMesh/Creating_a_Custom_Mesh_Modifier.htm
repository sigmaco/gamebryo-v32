<h1>Creating a Custom Mesh Modifier</h1>

<p>Applications may create new mesh modifiers to perform any task
that modifies mesh data at runtime. We use the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiWaterModifier</span> class from the <a href=
"../../Learn/Demos/MeshCreation_Demo_Overview.htm">Mesh
Creation</a> demo as an example.</p>

<p>Mesh modifiers will typically over-ride all of the following
virtual functions defined in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshModifier.htm">NiMeshModifier</a></span>
class:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">virtual bool Attach(NiMesh*
    pkMesh)</span></li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">virtual bool Detach(NiMesh*
    pkMesh)</span></li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">virtual bool
    SubmitTasks(NiMesh* pkMesh, NiSyncArgs* pkArgs,
    NiSPWorkflowManager* pkWFManager, const bool bReset =
    false)</span></li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">virtual bool
    CompleteTasks(NiMesh* pkMesh, NiSyncArgs* pkArgs)</span></li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">virtual bool
    AreRequirementsMet(NiMesh* pkMesh, NiSystemDesc::RendererID
    ePlatform) const</span></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, modifiers that will be created in the Gamebryo
tool chain should implement the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">virtual void
    RetrieveRequirements(NiMeshRequirements&amp; kRequirements)
    const</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The default implementations for these functions specify no
requirements in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RetrieveRequirements</span> and always return
true for <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AreRequirementsMet</span>.</p>

<h2>Data Typically Stored in a Mesh Modifier object</h2>

<p>The issue of data ownership is very important when working
with mesh modifiers. In general, mesh modifiers should store, in
member variables, the following types of data:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Flags and other per-modifier data will almost always be
    stored in the modifier class. It is also possible to store
    modifier flags or local data in data streams on the mesh to
    which the modifier is attached. However, this data will not
    be available in the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">RetrieveRequirements</span> function or
    constructors. It is also a Gamebryo convention that modifiers
    should not <em>add</em> data
    streams to a mesh. Rather, the code that creates the modifier
    and attaches it to the mesh should add the necessary streams.
    This is to avoid bugs in the art pipeline.</li>

    <li>Floodgate objects are stored in the modifier class. There
    are several objects that might be needed if a modifier uses
    Floodgate, listed below. In general, the modifier will either
    keep smart pointers to objects or it will own the objects and
    be responsible for deleting them.</li>

    <li style="list-style: none">
        <ul>
            <li><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
            "../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPTask.htm">NiSPTask</a></span>
            objects: Tasks are the smallest divisible unit of
            Floodgate work. Task objects are persistent across
            multiple submissions, so modifiers that use Floodgate
            will typically allocate tasks in their <span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> functions and delete
            them in their <span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">Detach</span> functions.</li>

            <li><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
            "../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPStream.htm">NiSPStream</a></span>
            objects: These objects hold the data on which
            Floodgate operates. Modifiers typically create these
            streams in their <span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> function, using either
            data streams on the mesh as the source of the data,
            or using local members. Floodgate streams should be
            deleted in the <span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">Detach</span> function, or, if a
            <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiSPStream</span> object
            is a member variable of a modifier, it is essential
            that the <span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">NiSPStream::ClearTaskArrays</span>
            function be called on the member stream during the
            <span class="NDLSystemFont">Detach</span>
            function.</li>

            <li><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
            "../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPKernel.htm">NiSPKernel</a></span>-derived
            objects: Each Floodgate task has a kernel associated
            with it. The kernel should be owned by the owner of
            the task, which is the modifier.</li>

            <li><span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
            "../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflow.htm">NiSPWorkflow</a></span>
            objects: Modifiers should store smart pointers to any
            outstanding <span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflow</span> objects that
            Floodgate is processing. The pointer should be set
            when a task is submitted and set to 0 (released) when
            the task is completed. Note that the functions for
            submitting tasks in the <span class=
            "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
            "../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm">
            NiSPWorkflowManager</a></span> class all return the
            workflow that the task has been placed in.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiWaterModifier</span> stores
all of the above forms of data. Note that most pointers are
allocated in <span class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> and they
are all deleted in <span class="NDLSystemFont">Detach</span>.
That enables the sequence <span class="NDLSystemFont">Attach -
Detach - Attach</span> to be called without leaking memory.</p>

<p>Be very careful when using static data members and Floodgate -
bugs arise when multiple modifiers access the same static data
from multiple Floodgate threads. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiWaterModifier</span> class can use a static
member for its data because only one is ever executing in any
application.</p>

<h2>The Attach Function</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshModifier.htm#Updating_and_Managing_Parallel_Tasks">
NiMeshModifier::Attach</a></span> function must be implemented by
all sub-classes. It takes the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span> object for the modifier and it
should return true if the modifier successfully attached, false
otherwise. <span class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> functions
typically do all of the one-off initialization for the modifier.
For example, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiWaterMeshModifier::Attach</span> function
performs the following actions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Sets sync points. The water should only be computed if it
    is visible, so that is when we submit the task. If the water
    was always visible, we would be better off submitting during
    update to provide more time for the computation to proceed.
    In either case, the modifier must complete its work in time
    to render.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="indent1">
AddSubmitSyncPoint(NiSyncArgs::SYNC_VISIBLE);
AddCompleteSyncPoint(NiSyncArgs::SYNC_RENDER);
</pre>

<ul>
    <li>Allocate a Floodgate task to compute the water. Floodgate
    tasks are persistent objects, so we can allocate one now at
    initialization and use it throughout the lifetime of the
    modifier. Note that <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSPTask</span> objects are reference
    counted, so it is very important to use a smart pointer.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="indent1">
m_spTask = NiSPTask::GetNewTask();
</pre>

<ul>
    <li>Create a Floodgate kernel. The kernel is defined in a
    separate class and contains the code that computes the water
    surface and shading.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="indent1">
m_pkWaterKernel = NiNew NiWaterKernel;
m_spTask-&gt;SetKernel(m_pkWaterKernel);
</pre>

<ul>
    <li>Set up Floodgate streams. Most of the data for the
    Floodgate task comes from <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm">
    NiDataStream</a></span> objects on the mesh. The modifier
    sets up several <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiTSPStream.htm">NiTSPStream</a></span>
    objects and assigns the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm">NiDataStream</a></span>
    object as the source of data for the Floodgate stream, as
    shown below. The modifier owns the pointer to the Floodgate
    data stream because it knows about the expected lifetime of
    the stream (until the Floodgate task is released). This code
    also demonstrates why setup work is not done during modifier
    construction or when it is first added to the mesh: the
    Floodgate stream holds a pointer to the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm">NiDataStream</a></span>
    object from the mesh. If that pointer were to change, we
    would have no easy way of knowing that the Floodgate stream
    needs to be updated. The use of <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> and <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">Detach</span> enforces a guarantee that data
    streams will not change between their invocation.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="indent1">
NiDataStreamRef*pkDSRef = pkMesh-&gt;FindStreamRef(NiCommonSemantics::POSITION(), 0);
m_pkOutputPositionsSPStream = NiNew NiTSPStream&lt;NiPoint3&gt;;
m_pkOutputPositionsSPStream-&gt;SetDataSource(pkDSRef-&gt;GetDataStream());
m_pkOutputPositionsSPStream-&gt;SetBlockCount(pkDSRef-&gt;GetTotalCount());
m_spTask-&gt;AddOutput(m_pkOutputPositionsSPStream);
</pre>

<p>Other work might also be done in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> function. For example, the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiSkinningMeshModifier.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSkinningMeshModifier</span></a> class allocates
arrays of bone matrices for later use.</p>

<p>Conversely, a modifier that does not use Floodgate might not
do anything at all in <span class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span>,
or may only cache pointers into the mesh.</p>

<h2>The Detach Function</h2>

<p>The Detach function should undo any work done in the Attach
function so that Attach may be called again without leaking
resources or errors. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiWaterModifier</span> object deletes all of the
memory it allocated in <span class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span>
and sets all pointers to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NULL</span>.
Be particularly careful when a modifier has member variables of
type <a href=
"../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPStream.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSPStream</span></a>. These objects store
internal arrays that must be explicitly released to free memory,
using the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPStream.htm"><span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiSPStream::ClearTaskArrays</span></a> function.
Gamebryo's skinning, instancing and particle system simulator
modifiers all make use of this function.</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CompleteTasks</span> function is called before
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Detach</span>, and that the modifier
is currently attached to the mesh.</p>

<p>There is no need to remove the sync points registered for the
modifier. The modifier's <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SubmitTasks</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">CompleteTasks</span> functions will never be
called if the modifier is not attached.</p>

<h2>The SubmitTasks Function</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">SubmitTasks</span> function is
called each time processing for the modifier's mesh reaches a
submit sync point that the modifier has registered for. It is
hence the gateway through which all the modifier's per-frame
actions must pass. The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiSyncArgs.htm">NiSyncArgs</a></span>
object passed as an argument contains information about the sync
points for which we are being asked to submit. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SubmitTasks</span> function may be called
multiple times in one frame with different sync arguments.</p>

<p>Modifiers that do not use Floodgate can do any work in the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SubmitTasks</span> function. The
modifier will operate serially in that case.</p>

<p>Modifiers that use Floodgate typically do some per-frame setup
for the Floodgate task (such as setting variable data) and then
submit the Floodgate tasks for parallel processing. There are
several important items to consider when submitting the task:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">SubmitTasks</span>
    function takes a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm">NiSPWorkflowManager</a></span>
    object as an argument. This workflow manager must be used for
    all task submission. It is necessary to place all of the
    tasks for a single mesh in the same <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflow.htm">NiSPWorkflow</a></span>
    object in case there are dependencies between modifiers.
    Hence, all modifiers should use the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager::AddRelatedTask</span>
    function when adding tasks, and the mesh is responsible for
    calling <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager::FinishRelatedTasks.</span>
    This is vital for correct task execution.</li>

    <li>The <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager::AddRelatedTask</span>
    takes a task group as a parameter. Only tasks with the same
    task group are placed in the same workflow for Floodgate.
    This task group should always be constructed from the sync
    points for the task using the functions in <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/NiMain/NiSyncArgs.htm">NiSyncArgs</a></span>.
    For example, the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiWaterModifier::Attach</span> function
    includes the line:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="indent1">
NiUInt32 uiTaskGroup = NiSyncArgs::GetTaskGroupID(NiSyncArgs::SYNC_VISIBLE, NiSyncArgs::SYNC_RENDER);
</pre>

<ul>
    <li>When using the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">SYNC_POST_UPDATE</span> sync point, a
    modifier must use the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">NiSPWorkflowManager::AddRelatedTask</span>
    function with the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">bDelaySubmission</span> argument set to
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">true</span>. This causes the
    tasks to be queued for submission at a later point, in this
    case after update has completed. The update process will
    ensure that all of these delayed tasks are flushed after
    update has completed on the scene graph.</li>

    <li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">SubmitTasks</span>
    function must check that the task it is about to submit has
    been completed. If not, it should call <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">CompleteTasks</span> with arguments designed
    to complete the outstanding tasks. Typically, the value of
    the smart pointer to the floodgate workflow will be used to
    check for task completion: if the workflow smart pointer is
    non-zero then the task has not completed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiWaterModifier</span> object
stores the workflow in a smart pointer. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm">NiSPWorkflowManager</a></span>
object returns the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflow.htm">NiSPWorkflow</a></span>
object into which the task has been placed. All modifiers that
use Floodgate will store their workflows in this manner, because
it is the only handle available to force completion of the
tasks.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiWaterModifier</span> object
asserts that the workflow is NULL in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SubmitTasks</span>. This will be the case because
tasks are only submitted if the object is visible, and if an
object is visible it is always rendered, so the task is always
completed. Other Gamebryo modifiers, such as morphing or
skinning, can not make such assumptions. Those modifiers check
the value of their workflow smart pointers and complete the
workflow if it is not already <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NULL</span>.</p>

<h2>The CompleteTasks Function</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CompleteTasks</span> function
is called each time processing for the modifier's mesh reaches a
complete sync point that the modifier has registered for. The
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiSyncArgs.htm">NiSyncArgs</a></span>
object passed as an argument contains information about the sync
points, and typically includes a submit sync point of
<span class="NDLSystemFont">SYNC_ANY</span>, indicating that any
outstanding tasks that complete at the given sync point should be
completed, regardless of when they were submitted.</p>

<p>Modifiers that do not use Floodgate can do any work in the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CompleteTasks</span> function. The
modifier will operate serially in that case.</p>

<p>Modifiers that use Floodgate typically wait for any Floodgate
tasks to complete and then do any post-Floodgate processing such
as updating bounds or other data that depends on the Floodgate
operation. The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflow.htm">NiSPWorkflow</a></span>
object returned by the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiFloodgate/NiSPWorkflowManager.htm">NiSPWorkflowManager</a></span>
object in <span class="NDLSystemFont">SubmitTasks</span> is the
handle for accessing Floodgate. Modifiers typically check for a
non-<span class="NDLSystemFont">NULL</span> value for the
workflow (<span class="NDLSystemFont">NULL</span> would indicate
no outstanding tasks) and then wait on the workflow to
complete:</p>
<pre>
if (m_spWorkflow)
{
    NiStreamProcessor::Get()-&gt;Wait(m_spWorkflow);
    m_spWorkflow = 0;
}
</pre>

<p>It is important to set the workflow to NULL to indicate that
there is no outstanding task and to allow the workflow to return
to the free object pool.</p>

<h2>The RetrieveRequirements Function</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">RetrieveRequirements</span>
function is called by the Gamebryo tool chain to determine the
properties that modifiers demand from meshes. It is only required
if the modifier will be created in the tool chain. The only
argument to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RetrieveRequirements</span> function is a
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMeshRequirements.htm">NiMeshRequirements</a></span>
object that should be filled with additional sets of requirements
imposed by the modifier. For example, the following code from the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMorphMeshModifier.htm">NiMorphMeshModifier</a></span>
class sets one of many requirements, in this case on the weights
for the morph targets:</p>
<pre>
NiUInt32 uiReqIndex;
NiUInt32 uiSet1Index = kRequirements.CreateNewRequirementSet();
NiUInt32 uiStreamID = 1;
// Weights
uiReqIndex = kRequirements.AddRequirement(uiSet1Index, NiCommonSemantics::
    MORPHWEIGHTS(), 0, NiMeshRequirements::STRICT_INTERLEAVE,
    uiStreamID++, NiDataStream::USAGE_USER, NiDataStream::ACCESS_CPU_READ |
    NiDataStream::ACCESS_CPU_WRITE_MUTABLE, NiDataStreamElement::
    F_FLOAT32_1);
</pre>

<h2>The AreRequirementsMet Function</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">AreRequirementsMet</span>
function is called every time a modifier is considered for
attachment to a mesh. The modifier will not be attached if this
function returns false.</p>

<p>The function should return false if the modifier does not
expect to be able to execute with the given mesh, for any reason.
Correct implementation of this function will ensure that there
are not crashes inside the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> function or the Floodgate kernel
due to missing or incorrectly formatted data streams. In theory,
there is no need for data stream error checking in the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> function if the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">AreRequirementsMet</span> function is
implemented correctly.</p>

<p>Core Gamebryo modifiers (skinning, morphing, and so on) check the
mesh for every data stream that they will later access in the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Attach</span> function, and check
that the stream contains the correct format, access, and so on.
For example, this is just a small part of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AreRequirementsMet</span> function for the
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMesh/NiSkinningMeshModifier.htm">NiSkinningMeshModifier</a></span>
class that checks for the presence of position data suitable for
skinning:</p>
<pre>
NiDataStreamElement::Format akFormats[4];
akFormats[0] = NiDataStreamElement::F_FLOAT32_3;
akFormats[1] = NiDataStreamElement::F_FLOAT16_3;
bInvalid |= !NiMeshUtilities::ValidateStream(
    "NiSkinningMeshModifier(Hardware)", pkMesh,
    NiCommonSemantics::POSITION_BP(), 0,
    akFormats, 2,
    NiDataStream::ACCESS_GPU_READ);
</pre>
