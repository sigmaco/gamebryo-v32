<h1>Cloning and Data Streams</h1>

<p>Vertex data is "shared" when more than one <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span> 
 instance references a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStream.htm">NiDataStream</a></span> 
 instance (ie, via a common pointer in the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiDataStreamRef.htm">NiDataStreamRefs</a></span> 
 attached to meshes). <a href="../General_Topics/Mesh_Data_Sharing.htm">Mesh 
 Data Sharing</a> and <a href="../Object_Systems/Cloning.htm#CloningBehaviorEnumeration">Cloning 
 Behavior Enumeration</a> discusses some of the basics for data sharing 
 and are pre-requisites for understanding the use cases presented in this 
 document.</p>

<p>Gamebryo defaults to the following cloning flags based 
 off of the CPU write access flag specified at creation time:</p>

<!--(Table)=========================================================-->
<table>
    <thead>

<tr>
<th>

	CPU Write Access Flag</th>
<th>
Default Cloning Behavior Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<tr>
<td>
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ACCESS_CPU_WRITE_STATIC</span></td>

<span class="NDLSystemFont">CLONE_SHARE</span></td></tr>

<span class="NDLSystemFont">ACCESS_CPU_WRITE_MUTABLE</span></td>

<span class="NDLSystemFont">CLONE_COPY</span></td></tr>

<span class="NDLSystemFont">ACCESS_CPU_WRITE_VOLATILE</span></td>
<td>
<span class="NDLSystemFont">CLONE_BLANK_COPY</span></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>



<p>These default flags can also be set by calling <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::SetDefaultCloningBehavior</span>. The 
 application may specify a different cloning behavior via <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream::SetCloningBehavior</span>.</p>

<h2>Cloning Use Cases</h2>

<h4>Use case 1: Basic Clones</h4>

<p>The streams and stream contents of two meshes are shared. 
 Transforms and materials might differ between the two instances, but the 
 geometry data representation is the same. With the deprecated <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiGeometry</span> 
 API, this scenario was represented by two <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiGeometry</span> 
 instances that share a <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiGeometryData</span> 
 instance. With <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span>, the scenario is 
 represented by two <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh </span>instances that 
 have an identical <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreamRef</span> array. 
 &nbsp;The <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreams</span> are shared via smart pointers 
 between the two meshes. This can be accomplished using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject::Clone</span> 
 method by making sure that all of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreams</span> 
 that are going to be shared have their <a href="../Object_Systems/Cloning.htm#CloningBehaviorEnumeration">Cloning 
 Behavior</a> set to <span class="NDLSystemFont">CLONE_SHARE</span>. </p>

<h4>Use case 2: Shared vertex buffer, no shared data</h4>

<p>The data representing two distinct objects is stored 
 in different regions of the same vertex buffer. In this scenario, even 
 though the two meshes share the same <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreams</span>, 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreamRef</span> array will reference 
 different regions within those streams. This can be advantageous when 
 vertex buffer swapping is an application bottleneck. This cannot be expressed 
 using the cloning operation and must be created manually.</p>

<h4>Use case 3: Some shared data</h4>

<p>In this scenario, two <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMeshes</span> 
 may "mix-and-match" how the data is shared. Some data stream 
 pointers may be shared. Other <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStreamRefs</span> 
 may point to completely different buffers, or different regions on buffers. 
 An example of this is cloning objects throughout the world, like mailboxes. 
 If you bake in lighting into vertex colors, you want to share the generic 
 vertex data across all clones (positions, normals, UV coordinates, etc), 
 but want to have unique vertex colors per mesh. This is possible with 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh</span>, as each vertex stream is individually 
 reference counted. This cannot be expressed using the cloning operation 
 and must be created manually. However, one possible implementation path 
 is to do a basic clone without the custom streams on the original mesh 
 and later attaching the correct custom streams to the new meshes. Another 
 implementation alternative, is to set the unique buffers to be CLONE_BLANK_COPY 
 and write to them later.</p>

<h4>Use case 4: Duplicate copy of data</h4>

<p>In some cases, a user may want the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh::Clone</span> 
 operation to produce an exact duplicate of the original <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span>. 
 In this case, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream's</span> cloning 
 behavior needs to be set to<span class="NDLSystemFont"> NiObject::CLONE_COPY</span> 
 through the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetCloningBehavior</span>. This 
 isn't always guaranteed to work, as it requires the ability to <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_READ</span> 
 the data stream in order to perform the copy. This implicitly limits the 
 user to <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_MUTABLE</span> data streams 
 as <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_VOLATILE</span> cannot be locked 
 for <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_READ</span> and there is no use case 
 for <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_STATIC</span>. Note that this 
 approach doesn't actually share any data.</p>

<h4>Use case 5: Sharing the layout, but not the data</h4>

<p>In some cases, a user may want the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMesh::Clone</span> 
 operation to produce a copy of the original <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream</span> 
 that has the same regions, but has never been written to. In this case, 
 the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiDataStream's</span> cloning behavior needs 
 to be set to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiObject::CLONE_BLANK_COPY</span> 
 through the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SetCloningBehavior</span>. This 
 is the preferred method for cloning <span class="NDLSystemFont">CPU_WRITE_VOLATILE</span> 
 buffers, as it is not possible to carry over the contents from one lock 
 call to another. Directly sharing volatile buffers will result in rendering 
 errors.</p>
