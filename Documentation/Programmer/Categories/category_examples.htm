<h1>Category usage examples</h1>

<p>Categories are a powerful and flexible mechanism that you can use to manage which 
    targets (system services, entities or other objects) receive specific messages. 
    You can use them to group entity state updates by any number of criteria. And you can
use them to invoke a Behavior on multiple Entities with a single
request. Category usage examples include the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Category per cell in a fixed Grid</b>: Create a
    category for each cell in a virtual world (for example, 100m
    on a side). Entities subscribe to the new cell Category and
    unsubscribe from the old one as they cross a boundary.<ul>
            <li>Computation: cellNum(Pos) = trunc(Pos.x/cellSize) + trunc(Pos.y/cellSize) * 
                maxColumns. </li>
            <li>Producer: send messages and entity state updates to category 
                cellNum(producerPos). Periodically recompute the category as the producer moves.</li>
            <li>Consumer: subscribe to receive from categories in the ranges trunc(x - 
                radius/2):trunc(x+radius/2) + trunc(y - radius/2)*maxColumns:trunc(y + 
                radius/2)*maxColumns. In a doubly nested loop, this would be a square region. A 
                more sophisticated but similar computation would be needed for a circular region 
                or 3d regions. Periodically recompute the categories as the consumer moves. 
                Increase the radius used in this calculation to take into account how much 
                producers and consumers can move between the periodic recomputations. Using a 
                cellSize and radius of the same value is a good rule of thumb resulting in about 
                4 cells in a consumer&#39;s subscription set.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Category per cell in a dynamic Grid</b>: Start with
    the grid from the previous example. As the density of
    entities increases, subdivide the cell, construct a new
    category and assign it to the new cell. When adjacent cells
    fall below some predetermined density, merge them and destroy
    one of the categories. You will have to manually transmit
    split and merge changes to the producers and consumers in the
    cell prior to performing the split/merge. This is a simple
    but effective technique for load-balancing your world and can
    be extended to an arbitrary level of sophistication if
    needed.<ul>
            <li>Computation: use a quad tree to store the geometry of each cell and a unique 
                integer to represent the cell number (e.g. a GUID). As each split or merge 
                occurs, incrementally update the quad tree. It is probably not worth the effort 
                to reuse cell numbers of deleted cells.</li>
            <li>Producer: from the producer&#39;s position query the quad tree for the cell and 
                associated cell number. Send update messages to that cell number.</li>
            <li>Consumer: from the consumer&#39;s position and radius of interest, query the quad 
                tree for the overlapping cells and associated cell numbers. Consume categories 
                with values equal to those grid cell numbers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Communications frequency layers</b>: One category for
    each of N entity state update frequencies. A consumer can
    subscribe to low frequency categories and can see
    highly-latent data, but from much farther away. Lower
    frequency categories can be associated with much larger
    cells. The higher the rate at which a Category is sent, the
    more overhead will be generated, so a client would subscribe
    to fewer high data rate Categories corresponding to nearby
    producers.<ul>
            <li>Computation: use the grid cell computation described above, but using three 
                radius values, small, medium and large. For example, 20m, 200m, 2000m.</li>
            <li>Producer: produce data into three categories. Using a regular update rate, a 
                medium update rate and a slow update rate. For example, 1/2 second, 5 second, 60 
                second updates. Recompute production category at about the same rate.</li>
            <li>Consumer: subscribe to three sets of categories using the corresponding grid 
                cell computation, and a small, medium and large radius (for example, 20m, 200m, 
                2000m). Recompute consumption at about the same rate as the producer, and widen 
                radius of interest according to that lower recomputation rate. Note that there 
                will only be about 3 x 4 categories subscribed by each consumer, but all 
                entities out to 2km will be visible. Also note that the reduction in update rate 
                and low average density over a large area, you should expect to see a 
                surprisingly small number of updates arriving. Due to the long distances 
                associated with slower updates, you should also expect to see little angular 
                error for each entity.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Category layer per consumer bandwidth</b>: Make each
    Category correspond to a common consumer bandwidth value
    (fibre, DSL, cable, 56K modem). Have producers factor in
    entity density when deciding what update rate per entity to
    use for the target bandwidth layer. Higher data rate clients
    would receive more frequent and possibly larger updates. Low
    data rate clients would receive messages appropriate for
    their bandwidth. A producer would not need to be aware which
    consumers are subscribed to categories in which layers, it
    just does the send and the consumer decides which frequency
    of data it needs.<ul>
            <li>Computation: Use the same category computation as the communication frequency 
                layers entry above.</li>
            <li>Producer: use the same production rules as above.</li>
            <li>Consumer: based on ISP bandwidth availability or momentary bandwidth 
                availability or congestion, switch from one &quot;frequency&quot; to another, or reduce 
                the radius of interest when computing the consumer category set. The result will 
                be less frequent and less accurate state updates, or updates from only nearer 
                entities.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Category per consumer</b>: A geometric interest
    management module could keep individual producers up to date
    with lists of the consumers that they must send to or
    consider sending to. Then the producer would send to each
    consumer in turn. While this may not appear very efficient,
    there may be cases where a careful geometric query could
    reduce bandwidth usage enough that the extra number of send
    requests could be justified.<ul>
            <li>Computation: compute a category based on the player&#39;s ID. A server side interest 
                management module would keep track of the player-specific categories and the 
                positions of entities. The module would send player-specific categories to 
                producers that are near the player&#39;s location. The rate of recomputation must be 
                factored into the nearness computation. Interest can be centrally computed 
                relatively efficiently given certain data structures. However, it can become a 
                compute and communication bottleneck and is a single point of failure. These 
                consequences can be somewhat mitigated by performing a rough computation 
                centrally and a more detailed recomputation at each producer.</li>
            <li>Producer: send to the list of player-specific categories until further notice.</li>
            <li>Consumer: subscribe one time only to the player-specific category it is 
                assigned.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Category per "layer"</b>: Partition types of data by
    function on different "layers" where each layer is
    represented by a Category. For example, visible, radar,
    audible. One-on-one combat data (hit points, for example),
    separate from "external" appearance data. Data only seen when
    in a party (such as party-chat), guild, or raid group. Data
    needed by AIs (for example, position and aggro-level, but
    nothing else). Clients interested in a specific layer would
    subscribe to the corresponding Category and receive the
    relevant data while not receiving or processing data it could
    not use.<ul>
            <li>Computation: Each layer would have a different constant ID. This ID would be 
                combined with one of the other categorization policies, likely as high order 
                bits. Each layer could use a different policy.</li>
            <li>Producer: each layer would correspond to a replication group to filter down to 
                needed entity properties.</li>
            <li>Consumer: A client or other consumer would choose the layers they need given the 
                current mode of operation. For example, if the radar module mounted and engaged 
                that categorization policy would be executed.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Category per dungeon instance</b>: Each instance would
    have a disjoint set of Categories. While geometrically at the
    same location, you don't want data from two instances
    mingling. This way, several sets of players could be
    apparently in the same geometric location in the world, but
    could receive different messages and experience the game
    separately or with a limited number of their friends.<ul>
            <li>Computation: each dungeon instance would be assigned a unique ID. That ID would 
                be composed with the category that results from one of the other categorization 
                policies, likely as high order bits.</li>
            <li>Producer: each producer would be aware of the dungeon instance it inhabits, and 
                would compose its ID into the categories produced to.</li>
            <li>Consumer: each consumer would be aware of the dungeon instance it inhabits, and 
                would compose its ID into the categories produced to. Note that &quot;teleporting&quot; 
                between instances to join one&#39;s friends is as simple as updating the dungeon 
                instance ID being used by the consumer.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Category per visibility set</b>: Use graphical
    intervisibility "sets" to curtail the expense of
    line-of-sight checking. Each large room would get its own
    category. While complex, this is data that could be
    precomputed by preprocessing the environment.<ul>
            <li>Computation: Compute Quake-like potential visibility sets (PVS), chunky BSP 
                trees, or use rendering portal data and assign a unique ID to each volume. These 
                geometric data structures are easy to query for a location point or effective 
                &quot;sphere&quot; of interest.</li>
            <li>Producer: use the ID of the volume in which the producer&#39;s center of gravity 
                exists.</li>
            <li>Consumer: use IDs of volumes that overlap the current location or a sphere of 
                interest around the entity. Certain precomputations are very good at filtering 
                out areas that are impossibly to see (for example behind portals), or those that 
                are visible (for example through a door or window).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Category for wide area effects</b>: Use a different
    Category for wide-area effects (everyone is subscribed to
    this category): nuclear explosion, gigantic dragon towering
    over the horizon, general chat channel. Everyone in a large
    region would subscribe to such categories which would have
    extremely low volume, but such large scale effects are
    important to subscribe to at a distance. The issue is more
    about ensuring the game design has the desired effect. If too
    much data is transmitted you might consider whether the
    design requires too much and needs to be abstracted
    more.<ul>
            <li>Computation: use a single global category, or a category per major zone.</li>
            <li>Producer: the large entity would produce to the well-known category at a rate 
                that makes sense for the consumers. Given only a few such entities, a decent 
                update rate should not swamp clients.</li>
            <li>Consumer: as well as nearby entities, the consumer would subscribe to the 
                large-entity category so it could be affected by nuclear blasts or could see 
                large entities.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Global Category</b>: Use a shared/global category
    (everyone is subscribed) for "world simulation" data:
    day/night/eclipse, earthquakes, weather changes, plague
    breaks out, the New Year's Day event begins, server
    maintenance will begin in 10 minutes, and so on. These
    Categories would be low traffic, but everyone would subscribe
    to them.<ul>
            <li>See wide area effects above.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Internet radio.</b> A Category can be assigned to a
    given streaming audio feed, and used as a shorthand for
    subscribers. In this example, there would be no requirement
    to use the message system.<ul>
            <li>This is really a non-use of categories, but instead a publication of an entity 
                property describing the audio feed. The categorization and publication of that 
                &quot;ambient audio entity&quot; would use one of the other&nbsp; policies.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Chat channel</b>. A Category can be assigned to a chat
    channel for a party, clan or area in-game. The chat could be
    routed through the message system using the category
    explicitly, or the category could be used as an ID that
    corresponds to a third party notion of a chat channel.<ul>
            <li>Computation: use the clan ID, or compute a unique ID for each party.</li>
            <li>Producer: if routed through the server, when a player sends a chat message on a 
                given chat channel, the message would be sent to the computed category. This 
                would allow the messages to be sent between players using the shortest route.</li>
            <li>Consumer: a client would subscribe to the categories for each chat channel they 
                have not blocked.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>A group of one.</b> It is quite common to create and
    use a Category that is private and listened to only by a
    single object. This approach reuses the powerful many to many
    mechanism to realize point to point or multipoint to point communication.<ul>
            <li>Computation: allocate a GUID for each consumer. Distribute those GUIDs using 
                something similar to a name resolution service.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>IR Sensor.</b> Using model mix-in, an entity that
    mixes in an IR producer (like an engine) could automatically
    publish positions into the IR Categories. A missile could mix
    in an IR sensor that subscribes to the IR categories. In this
    way the missile only receives position updates for entities
    that it can sense. If the missile is later edited to mix in
    radio emissions, it would automatically also pick up entities
    that transmit that.<ul>
            <li>Computation: use one of the other categorization policies, probably based on 
                position. Allocate a new layer specifically for infrared emmisions.</li>
            <li>Producer: the IR emitter model is mixed into any heat producing entity, and 
                computes the IR layer category given the position of the current entity.</li>
            <li>Consumer: the IR sensor model is mixed into any heat detecting entity, and 
                computes the set of IR layer categories given the sensor radius and current 
                position.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
