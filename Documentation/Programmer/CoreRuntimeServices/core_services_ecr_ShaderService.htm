<h1>Shader Service Overview</h1>

<p>The <a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_shader_svc.htm"><span class="NDLSystemFont">
ecr::ShaderService</span></a> class is used to load shaders. Most
applications that render objects will register an instance of the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ecr::ShaderService</span> class with
the <a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__ServiceManager.htm">ServiceManager</a>.</p>

<p>All of the work of the ShaderService is done during
<span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span>. The service requests all
assets with a mime type matching known shader libraries (see
<a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiShaderLibrary.htm">NiShaderLibrary</a>).
Each shader library reports a set of mime types associated with that
library. For example, the NiD3DXEffectShaderLibrary supports mime types
"urn:fx-shader" and "urn:fx-shader-compiled". In order for the ShaderService
to load the shaders for a given shader library that library <i>must</i> be 
linked into the application and have its top level header included in the application.</p>

<p>
All of the Gamebryo shader libraries make use of the Gamebryo SDM (static data manager) 
initialization chain. Each shader library registers itself with the NiShaderFactory when
they are initialized through the SDM initialization chain. However, for a shader library's
to be initialized it <i>must</i> be both linked into the application and have it's top
level header included in the application. If an application fails to both link in and 
include a shader library's top level then the shader library will not be registered and
the ShaderService will not load any shaders for that library. Additionally, the shader service 
uses an <a href="../AssetRuntimeService/asset_runtime_intro.htm">asset locator
request</a> to find shaders to load. It is thus essential that
shaders be including in the directories processed by the Asset
Locator.</p>

<p>To prevent large hitches while loading shaders the ShaderService will spend a maximum of 10 milliseconds, by default, 
in <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span>. The 
time restriction on <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> is to allow time for other
services to tick while shader loading is occurring. Due to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> time restriction 
the ShaderService may require many ticks before it is able to complete initialization. The 
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderService::OnInit</span> operation time is evaluated after every shader load. Meaning it
is possible for the ShaderService to spend more than the maximum allowed amount of time in 
<span class="NDLSystemFont">ShaderService::OnInit</span> if a single shader takes longer than that amount of time to load.
</p>

<p>Shaders that are located by the Asset Locator are loaded and
made available for the Core Runtime shader system. No further
processing is done until <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">OnShutdown</span>, when all of the shader
resources are released.</p>
