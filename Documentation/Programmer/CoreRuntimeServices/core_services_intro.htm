<h1>Core Runtime Services: Introduction</h1>

<p>Core Runtime Services wrap Core Runtime functionality,
providing Game Framework objects such as services and scripts
with access to Core Runtime objects and data. For example, the
Animation Service in the <a href=
"core_services_egmAnimation.htm">egmAnimation</a> library
provides a service that manages Core Runtime animation assets and
objects. It also provides handling of Entities with animation
related properties, and script access to C++ functionality.
Additional services are provided for rendering, scene graph
management, input, terrain, and many other modules of the Core
Runtime.</p>

<p>This section of the documentation is a guide to the services,
including a high level description of their functionality and
techniques for programming with them. Summary information and
links to the API reference can be found in the <a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_intro.htm">Quick
Reference To Services</a> section.</p>
