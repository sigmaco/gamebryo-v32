<h1>Property Visualization Service Overview</h1>

<p>The property visualization service (<a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_prop_visualization_svc.htm">
<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">egmVisualizers::PropertyVisualizationService</span></a>)
is a service which handles visually representing entity
properties which do not typically lend themselves to graphic
visualization. For instance, a property visualizer allows a
"Radius" property to be represented as a sphere in the graphical
world, where the sphere's size will adjust based on the value of
the Radius property.</p>

<h2>Entity Handling</h2>

<p>The property visualization service handles entity discovery
messages, looking at the newly created entity for any extra data
indicating that the entity has property visualizers attached.
This data then gets handed off to a <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PropertyVisualizerFactory</span> object which
inspects the data and creates the appropriate visualizer
implementing the IPropertyVisualizer interface. The visualizer
itself is responsible for creating and updating its geometry.</p>

<p>On an entity update message, the property visualizations
service inspects the updated entity for any created visualizers.
If the entity has visualizers, than the visualizer's <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">UpdateGeometry</span> method is called, allowing
the visualizer to check which entity properties were updated and
modify the visualizer geometry appropriately.</p>

<p>On an entity removal message, the property visualization
service inspects the entity for any created visualizers. If the
entity has visualizers, then the visualizer's <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">RemoveGeometry</span> method is called, allowing
the visualizer to remove any geometry it created and perform
other necessary cleanup. The visualizer is then removed from the
property visualization service.</p>

<h2>Related Classes</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">IPropertyVisualizer</span> is the
interface which all property visualizers must inherit from.
Instances of classes inheriting <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">IPropertyVisualizer</span> are only created by
the <span class="NDLSystemFont">PropertyVisualizerFactory</span>,
which inspects extra data attached to an entity and constructs a
class of the appropriate type.</p>

<p>There are two helper classes which the property visualization
service makes use of: the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VisualizerConnectionTracker</span> and the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">VisualizerVisibilityTracker</span>.
The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VisualizerConnectionTracker</span> keeps track of
entity visibility such that visualizers can be made invisible
when the entities they're attached to become invisible.
<span class="NDLSystemFont">The
VisualizerConnectionTracker</span> keeps track of entity
connections - certain visualizers (for instance, the Connection
visualizer) need to know about other entities other than the one
to which the visualizer is attached; the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VisualizerConnectionTracker</span> keeps track of
the connections and allows visualizers a common point to access
this information.</p>

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

<p>Property visualizers that rely on other entities other than
the ones to which they are attached (for instance, the Connection
visualizer) introduce complications to the Entity Handling scheme
presented earlier. These visualizers need to know when entity
updates occur not only on the entities to which they are attached
but also on the entities to which they are connected. Thus, on
entity update and removal messages, the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">VisualizerConnectionTracker</span> object is
queried to see if visualizers not attached to the updated/removed
entity need to be updated, and those visualizers have their
<span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateGeometry</span> method
called.</p>

create property visualizers in the Entity Modeling Tool.</p>
