<h1>Light Service Overview</h1>

<p>The <a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_light_svc.htm"><span class="NDLSystemFont">
ecr::LightService</span> class</a> interfaces the Game Framework
to the Core Runtime <a href=
"../General_Topics/Per_vertex_Lighting_with_Dynamic_Effects.htm">lighting</a>
and <a href=
"../Shadowing_System/Introduction_to_the_Shadowing_System.htm">shadowing</a>
systems.</p>

<p>The Light Service manages light sources and the lists of scene
graphs (<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiNode.htm">NiNode</a></span> objects)
which they affect. The Light Service also manages shadow
generators, which are optionally associated with directional,
point, and spot lights, as well as the lists of scene graphs
(<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span> objects) which may
cast and/or receive shadows.</p>

<p>The following two sections discuss how to make property
changes to <a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Light.htm">
Light</a> entities in order to accomplish desired lighting and shadowing behavior 
    for a scene. The final section discusses the internal
details for how the Light Service accomplishes these
capabilities.</p>

<h2>Properties to Control Lighting Behavior</h2>

<p>There are many different properties that should be considered when thinking about 
    lighting behavior. First all entity models that should be lit need to mix-in the 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">Lightable</span> model. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Actor</span>, <span class="NDLSystemFont">Mesh</span>, and <span class="NDLSystemFont">Terrain</span> models already mix-in the 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">Lightable</span> model. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">Lightable</span> model defines the maximum number of lights that 
    are allowed to affect an entity per light type. This allows the user to control 
    the lighting quality vs. performance at a per entity level.</p>
    <p>The primary property used to determine if a light should affect an entity is the 
        light&#39;s range. If an entity is within the range of a light (and it includes the 
        Lightable model) then the light will affect that entity. Depending on the layout 
        of a scene it is possible to have an entity that is within the range of more 
        lights than it supports (defined by the Lightable model). In these cases the 
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">LightService</span> will compute which lights have the greatest influence over the 
        entity and those lights will be chosen to affect the object. Three main factors 
        are considered when computing a light&#39;s influence over an entity, the light&#39;s 
        distance from the entity as a percentage of the light&#39;s range, the light&#39;s luminosity 
        value on the entity, and the percentage of the entity that will be affected by a 
        light. The end result is that if an entity only supports two point lights, and 
        the scene contains 3 point lights, then the two closest and brightest 
        lights will be chosen to affect the entity. </p>
    <p>Further lighting control is available through the light&#39;s <span class="NDLSystemFont">LightPriority</span> property. 
        The <span class="NDLSystemFont">LightPriority</span> property is used by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">LightService</span> to weight a light&#39;s 
        influence factor. Giving a light a higher priority will cause that light to have 
        greater influence when compared to other lights. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">LightPriority</span> property 
        provides a way to give users more control over the lighting in a scene. A good 
        example use cause for adjusting a light&#39;s priority would be if a scene contains 
        a &#39;Sun&#39; light source. In an outdoor scene the Sun should always be affecting 
        every entity, to ensure this happens simply max out the Sun entity&#39;s light 
        priority.</p>
    <p>As a final override the Light model contains an <span class="NDLSystemFont">AlwaysAffectedByLight</span> property and 
        a <span class="NDLSystemFont">NeverAffectedByLight</span> property. The always affected and never affected 
        properties allows a user to explicitly set entities that should always be 
        affected by a light and entities that should never be affected by a light. These 
        properties override all of the logic described above making it possible for an 
        entity to be affected by a light even if the entity is outside of the light&#39;s 
        range.</p>
    <p>To help improve the light service&#39;s performance at runtime the 
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateLightingOnMove</span> property should always be set to false (defaults to false). 
        Anytime an entity&#39;s position changes its lighting could change, meaning that if 
        an entity moves the lighting for that entity should be reevaluated. Evaluating 
        lighting for an entity is not cheap and can become rather expensive if large 
        number of entities in a scene are moving. To address this problem the 
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateLightingOnMove</span> property is used. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateLightingOnMove</span> property defines 
        if the light service should reevaluate lighting for an entity when that entity 
        moves. <span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateLightingOnMove</span> is set to false by default, so entities will only 
        have their lighting evaluated when they are created. Setting 
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">UpdateLightingOnMove</span> to true will cause lighting for that entity to be 
        reevaluate every-time that entities moves.</p>

<h2>Properties to Control Shadowing Behavior</h2>

<p>Via the default property settings in the standard model
library, all Actor and Mesh entities are initially set to both
cast and receive shadows. However, by default, all lights are
initially set to not cast shadows. This approach makes it
straightforward for artists to selectively enable shadowing
capabilities for individual lights, without having to consider
the shadow manager itself or individual cast/receive shadow
properties, by default.</p>

<p><a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__ShadowGenerator.htm">
ShadowGenerator</a> mix-in properties may be changed at run-time
via lua scripts or C++ code, for individual light entities. These
mix-in properties include whether to cast shadows, render
backfaces, generate static shadows, strictly observe the size
hint, and use the default depth bias. Other mix-in properties
include a size hint from 1x1 to 2048x2048 for the shadow map, a
shadow technique, and a floating point depth bias. See
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiShadowGenerator.htm">NiShadowGenerator</a></span>
for more details on these settings, including more detailed
information on the shadowing techniques provided by Gamebryo.</p>

<p><a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Models/StandardModelLibrary__Shadowable.htm">
Shadowable</a> mix-in properties may be changed at run-time via
lua scripts or C++ code, for individual Mesh or Actor entities.
These mix-in properties include whether the entity casts shadows
as well as whether it receives shadows. They represent a
straightforward "opt out" setting for individual entities in
terms of shadow casting or receiving.</p>

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

<p>With regard to shadow mapping capabilities, the Light Service
initializes the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiShadowManager.htm">NiShadowManager</a></span>
and sets it to be active. In particular, it initializes the
shadow click generator, the shadow manager's scene camera, and a
shadow render step, to which a preprocessing callback function is
assigned.</p>

<p>The Light Service registers for entity discovery, entity
property change, and entity removal messages, as well as scene
graph added and removed messages. These messages are used to
manage the underlying <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiLight</span>
attributes associated with a given entity.</p>

<p>If a light entity is discovered, the Light Service
automatically takes care of creating a corresponding <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiLight</span> and querying the light entity for
relevant properties to apply to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiLight</span>. Also, if the light entity is set
to cast shadows, relevant shadow casting properties are queried
to apply to a corresponding <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiShadowGenerator.htm">NiShadowGenerator</a></span>.</p>

<p>If properties change for a specific light entity, then the
Light Service updates the associated <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiLight</span> accordingly, and it iterates
through all the scene graphs to update the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiLight</span> object's Affected Nodes list.
Also, if shadow casting properties change for a specific light
entity, then the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiShadowGenerator</span> is created, if
necessary, and individual properties are queried in order to set
appropriate <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShadowGenerator</span>
parameters, as needed. Also, the function iterates through all
the scene graphs to update Unaffected Caster and Unaffected
Receiver lists appropriately.</p>

<p>If a light entity is removed, the Light Service takes care of
removing the light from the scene and cleaning up relevant
Affected Nodes lists.</p>

<p>If a scene graph is added, the Light Service ensures that the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span> representing the newly
added entity is attached to the Affected Nodes list for every
light that is in range. Also, the Light Service iterates through
all the shadow generators to ensure that, depending on the entity
property settings, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiNode</span>
casts shadows or not, and receives shadows or not, by updating
each light's Unaffected Casters and Unaffected Receivers
lists.</p>

<p>If a scene graph is removed, the Light Service ensures that
all references to that scene graph are removed from relevant
Affected Nodes, Unaffected Casters, and Unaffected Receivers
lists.</p>
