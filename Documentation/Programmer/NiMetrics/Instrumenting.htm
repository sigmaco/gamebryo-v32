<h1>Instrumenting with NiMetrics</h1>

<p>The Gamebryo engine comes pre-instrumented for the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMetrics</span> system, but it is also very easy 
 for a developer to add custom instrumentation to their application. Adding 
 new metrics is as easy as making calls to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMetricsLayer</span> 
 or creating an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMetricsTimer</span>. Each instrumentation 
 call needs nothing more than a name and a value. See the below class reference 
 or list of examples for more details about how to instrument code with 
 custom metrics.</p>

<p>If your application is based off of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span>, 
 then you should call <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication::UpdateMetrics</span> 
 once per frame. This will update the metrics system and allow output modules 
 to do any work that they need to do. If your application is not derived 
 from <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span>, then you will need 
 to implement a similar function in your application.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Metrics Names</h2>

<p>Each call to the metrics system requires a metrics name, 
 which are arbitrary strings. Different output modules can use the metrics 
 names in arbitrary ways and so depending on the desired output modules, 
 it may be necessary to name metrics in a particular way. Gamebryo organizes 
 its metrics hierarchically. All Gamebryo metrics start with "gb", 
 then their platform name, and finally the configuration. For example, 
 metrics for Win32 built with VC80 in Release mode will be "gbWin32VC80Release.*" 
 Gamebryo metrics also contain the name of the library that they are in 
 and then finally the name of the metric itself. For example, "gbXenonDebug.main.NumUpdates" 
 is the name of the Gamebryo metric for debug configurations for number 
 of <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span> updates in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMain</span> 
 library.</p>

<p>Although this is not a necessary step for an application, 
 Gamebryo defines all of its metrics names in a custom header and code 
 file per library. For example, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAnimation</span> 
 metrics are stored in <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAnimationMetrics.h</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAnimationMetrics.cpp</span>. Each library 
 uses its own set of macros and an enumeration of metrics, rather than 
 metrics names directly. With this approach, it becomes easy to modify 
 the names of metrics in a single place.</p>

<h2>Strings in the Metrics System</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most important consideration with metrics 
 names is that the strings themselves are copied shallowly and not deeply 
 because of the amount of string passing that must go on within the metrics 
 system. To avoid having repeated string allocations and deallocations 
 or the expense of an <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFixedString</span> lookup 
 for every single metrics call, the design decision was made to just use 
 the string pointers shallowly since for the vast majority of the time, 
 the string data will just be static data. Because of this restriction, 
 you must ensure that strings that are passed to the metrics system (either 
 via a timer or calls to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMetricsLayer</span>) 
 exist until <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShutdown</span> because some output 
 modules may continue to use strings after the call to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMetricsLayer</span> 
 returns.</p>

<h2>Debug Configuration Timers</h2>

<p>Although timers will return real data in a debug configuration, 
 this data is not reliable due to the extra overhead of debug mode. Although 
 the number of times the timers report data is still a valid measurement 
 and should be considered, the results of those timers should be ignored.</p>

<h2>Recording Singular Values</h2>

<p>Calls to <span class="NDLSystemFont">NIMETRICS_ADDVALUE</span> 
 with values of 1 is something to be wary of. This is the first approach 
 that is likely considered when trying to record the number of a particular 
 kind of event that has occurred. There is nothing incorrect about this 
 approach, but there is a better one. Consider summing the value internally 
 in a static variable, guarding it with <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFastCriticalSection</span> 
 as appropriate. With this aggregate static variable, call <span class="NDLSystemFont">NIMETRICS_ADDVALUE</span> 
 once per frame. This has two benefits: one is an increase in performance, 
 because you are making fewer calls to the metrics system. It is fairly 
 cheap, but can be significant if you are making many metrics calls. The 
 more important reason is that aggregating over a frame gives you a metric 
 with more meaning. When analyzing this metric, the average, min, and max 
 become meaningful numbers that represent those calculations per frame, 
 rather than just being 1 in all cases.</p>

<h2>Examples of Instrumentation</h2>

<h2>Example 1: Scope Timers</h2>

<p>Here is an example of timing a function with a scope 
 timer. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMetricsScopePCTimer</span> is an 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiMetricsScopeTimer.htm">NiMetricsScopeTimer</a></span> 
 that uses the performance counter as the clock. Scope timers start when 
 they are created and automatically stop when they go out of scope. They 
 call the appropriate <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiMetricsLayer.htm">NiMetricsLayer</a></span> 
 functions as necessary. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NIMETRICS_EVAL</span> 
 macro will include the timer in metrics-enabled builds but will compile 
 out that line of code in metrics-disabled builds.</p>

<pre>
    void MyGame::MyFunction()
    {
        NIMETRICS_EVAL(NiMetricsScopePCTimer kTimer("MyFunction_Time");)
        // kTimer starts automatically

        // do timed work here
        // ...

    } // kTimer goes out of scope and stops
</pre>

<h2>Example 2: Non-Scope Timers</h2>

<p>Here is an example of using a non-scope timer. The <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiMetricsClockTimer</span> is an <a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiMetricsTimer.htm">NiMetricsTimer</a> 
 that uses the system clock as the source of its timing values. Non-scope 
 timers need to be started and stopped manually, generally using the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiMetricsLayer.htm">NiMetricsLayer</a></span> 
 macros for starting and stopping timers. All of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NIMETRICS_</span> 
 macros compile out if metrics is not enabled, so this instrumenting code 
 will not affect non-metrics builds.</p>
 
 
<pre>
    void MyGame::UpdateMonsters()
    {
        // untimed setup work
        // ...

        NIMETRICS_EVAL(NiMetricsClockTimer kTimer("UpdateMonstersTime");)
        NIMETRICS_STARTTIMER(kTimer);

        // do timed work here
        // ...

        NIMETRICS_ENDTIMER(kTimer);

        // untimed cleanup work
        // ...
    } 
</pre>
 

<h2>Example 3: Values and Events</h2>

<p>This last block of code is an example function in a 
 game that gets called after one player has killed another. It increments 
 some number of kills, stores that in the metric system, and then potentially 
 enters frenzy mode. In this hypothetical game, when players kill enough 
 opponents, they enter a "frenzy mode" which gives them some 
 bonuses and has a full screen graphical effect. However, for some reason 
 this great looking effect slows down the entire game. In this case, we 
 use an event to mark where this mode starts.</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystem">NIMETRICS_ADDVALUE</span> 
 macro records a float value for a particular metric name. In this case, 
 the example is recording number of kills, so that the game could perhaps 
 track how frequently players kill each other to tweak the excitement of 
 a multiplayer mode. In addition, it creates an event using the <span class="NDLSystem">NIMETRICS_ADDEVENT</span> 
 macro to record when "frenzy mode" starts so that when looking 
 at metrics output, the relation of instrumented metrics and in-game events 
 can be more closely linked.</p>
 
<pre>
    void Player::ShotOtherPlayer()
    {
        NIMETRICS_ADDVALUE("PlayerKills", 1);

        m_uiNumberOfKills++;
        if (m_uiNumberOfKills > KILL_FRENZY_THRESHOLD)
        {
            // Have enough kills, so enter frenzy mode...
            NIMETRICS_ADDEVENT("FrenzyMode", 1);
            StartFrenzyMode();
        }
    } 
</pre>
