<h1>Organizing Your Assets</h1>

<p>The Asset Runtime Service allows considerable flexibility in
how assets are organized into subdirectories by providing
powerful location-independent access mechanisms. The one critical
requirement is that all of the assets that your application needs
must be grouped together below a single Asset Web Root directory.
Your application only requires a single <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AssetWeb.Path</span> configuration parameter to
be set to point to the Asset Web Root location.</p>

<p>Discussed below are some general guidelines and best practices
for organizing your assets.</p>

<h2>Example Asset Web Directory Structure</h2>

<p>The following screenshot demonstrates how your game assets
might be organized. The Toolbench game solution wizard and
default content settings support these data layout conventions.
In this example, the "MyGame" folder is the root of the asset
web. Additional media files needed at run-time can be stored in
additional folders within the asset web. It is not necessary to
include large source-only art assets in the asset web. Typically
everything shown would be checked into a revision control system,
with the exceptions of the "asset-web-metadata" and "Exported"
folders.</p>

<h2>Organization for EMT and World Builder Files</h2>

<p>You use Toolbench to create or import and modify entity model
files. You also use Toolbench to create block files for your
project that define initial conditions in the game world. At
runtime, your application requires exported versions of these
files. Entity model files are exported as "flat models" with a
<span class="NDLSystemFont">.flat</span> file extension. Block
files are exported as files with an <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">.xblock</span> extension. Additionally, there
will be libraries of mix-in Models and associated assets that you
will import into your project solution. We recommend the
following asset organization practices for these file types:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The Entity Model libraries from previous development that
    are imported into your project should be stored in
    directories one level below Asset Web Root. These
    directories' names should end with "Library." Toolbench will
    set things up this way when you create a new solution in its
    wizard. Also, following this guideline allows the system to
    automatically ensure that internal asset references used in
    the library are not broken if the directory is relocated
    wholesale or reused in another context.</li>

    <li>Create a new subdirectory under the Asset Web Root for
    each new EMT project and each new block file. This will keep
    supporting files grouped together and still allow sharing of
    a single "Exported" folder for .flat and .xblock files.</li>

    <li>By default, behavior scripts are stored in a single
    folder named "Behaviors" under each EMT project. This is a
    convenient location for editing the scripts in Toolbench.
    However, all asset web paths that contain script files will
    ultimately be added to the search path that is used by the
    script interpreter in the game engine. This effectively
    allows scripts to be stored anywhere.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Organization for Run-time Media Files</h2>

<p>Create a subdirectory under your asset web called "Media". Use
this location as the root for all the graphical, sound, and other
media files that are needed by your application at run-time.</p>

<p>We recommend that you define a platform that is the "generic
platform" for your game. This allows you to create variations
later to support a multi-platform game, multiple localizations,
and so on. This should be enforced by only storing assets for the
generic platform in the parent directory of a cluster of related
assets and creating additional subdirectories for variations of
these assets. For example, store the generic ogre in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">/Media/Characters/ogre.nif</span> and the
platform-specific Xbox ogre in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">/Media/Characters/Xbox360/ogre.nif</span>. By
using the same file name (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ogre.nif</span>) the Asset Runtime Service will
automatically be able to determine which variation to load on
each platform.</p>

<table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
    <tr align="left">
        <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD">
            <p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>

            <div class="NDLNote">
                In the event that a platform, locale, or
                similarly tagged variation does not exist, the
                Asset Runtime Service has an automatic fallback
                to use the generic asset.
            </div>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Sharing Content Builds</h2>

<p>Another "best practice" worth considering is creating a system
for sharing both content builds and source code builds among
developers. Typically, artists will want to have a convenient
method for updating their development environment to the latest
source code build without having to actually build the code
themselves. Likewise, programmers would like to have a convenient
method to update their development environment with all the
latest content without necessarily having to run the art pipeline
tools themselves. This amounts to having a standard and easy way
of replicating the contents of the asset web to all the
programmers' workstations.</p>

<p>The content of the asset web is a mix of both source assets
(solution, project, model, scripts, and block files) and
generated assets (.xblock files, .flat files, and lots of
exported artist content). You may or may not choose to commit all
of these files into a revision control system. If you do commit
all files, including generated assets, then you have a convenient
way of pushing the updates out to the programmers. However, it
may be too great a load on your RCS system to hold so many
revisions of mostly binary content files which can largely be
generated as needed from source assets.</p>

<p>Our recommended best practice is to create a batch process
that can pull source assets from the RCS system and generated
assets from a centralized build system or file server. The
merging of these two sources would produce the full set of assets
that are stored in the asset web. If you will be devising such a
system, the following is a (non-exhaustive) list of assets that
will be required by a typical game run-time. Note that the asset
runtime system will recognize each file as it is updated during
the merge process.</p>

<ul>
    <li>.xblock files exported from World Builder</li>

    <li>.flat model files exported from EMT</li>

    <li>all the script files (and their dependency modules) that
    are referenced by your entity models</li>

    <li>.nif Gamebryo scenegraph files</li>

    <li>.kfm and .kf Gamebryo animation files</li>

    <li>any required shader and texture map files</li>

    <li>audio sample files and other game audio data</li>
</ul>
