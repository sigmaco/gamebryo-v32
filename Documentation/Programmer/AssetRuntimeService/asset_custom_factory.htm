<h1>Creating a New Asset Factory</h1>

<p>The job of an asset factory is to load or otherwise generate the runtime C++ objects that are associated
with an asset. The simplest loader, the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__GenericAssetFactory.htm">efd::GenericAssetFactory</a></span> class,
streams the data from the file into a buffer and returns the buffer. More complex factories load a
primary asset, then identify sub-assets and load those, and register the asset with some other
service, before returning a message to say that the asset is ready for use. An asset factory is
free to do anything necessary to factory the asset, and may work closely with the system that is
requesting the asset.</p>

<h2>Summary of Asset Factory Requirements</h2>

<ul>
    <li>All asset factories must derive from the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/efd/efd__IAssetFactory.htm">efd::IAssetFactory</a></span> interface class and
    implement its pure virtual functions. This interface makes the asset factory usable with the
    Asset Factory Manager. Most factories will also want the functionality found in the
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/efd/efd__BaseAssetFactory.htm">efd::BaseAssetFactory</a></span> class, and
    should derive from it instead.</li>

    <li>Asset factories must correctly indicate that they are safe to call from the application
    main thread (the foreground) and/or the background loading thread. Asset factories that may be
    invoked in either the foreground or background thread must be thread safe, as they may be
    called from both threads simultaneously. Factories that operate in the background must ensure
    that any calls they make into another object are thread safe when that object is also used by
    the foreground thread. This is particularly true when using system services in the foreground
    thread.</li>

    <li>Asset Locate Request messages are the only messages that may be sent by an asset factory in
    the background thread, and these must be routed via the Asset Factory Manager.</li>

    <li>Asset factories that take more than one tick to load an asset (that is, more than one call
    to <span class="NDLSystemFont">efd::IAssetFactory::LoadAsset</span>) must be capable of
    handling multiple simultaneous loads. When an asset takes more than one tick, other requests
    may be processed in the same tick, or a preemptive request may come in while part way through
    an in-order load.</li>

    <li>An asset factory is responsible for remembering if has been asked to cancel a request and
    has indicated that it could not do so immediately. In such cases, the factory should do some
    work on each tick until it can cancel, and then actually cancel and return the fact that it
    cancelled.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the asset factory should, if possible, be able to load an asset over several calls
to the load function. For each call that does not complete, it returns the appropriate result and
the Asset Factory Manager service will make sure it is called again. The factory should do some
chunk of work on each invocation; how much is a difficult question. Ideally, about 10-20ms would be
good to allow the background thread to tick over at about 50Hz. However, there are no strict
requirements on this as it is difficult for some factories to control their step size.</p>

<h2>Deriving from efd::IAssetFactory</h2>

<p>All asset factories must derive from the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__IAssetFactory.htm">efd::IAssetFactory</a></span> interface class. Several
pure virtual methods must be implemented from this interface. See the class reference for the
details of each of these functions.</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">LoadAsset</span> is the function called by the Asset Factory
    Manager to load an asset.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLSystemFont">GetThreadSafety</span> informs other code of the thread safety
    of the factory.</li>
</ul>

<p>As an example of an implementation of <span class="NDLSystemFont">LoadAsset</span>, here is the
version from <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__GenericAssetFactory.htm">efd::GenericAssetFactory</a></span></p>
<pre>
IAssetFactory::LoadStatus GenericAssetFactory::LoadAsset(
    AssetFactoryManager* pFactoryManager,
    const AssetLoadRequest* pRequest,
    AssetLoadResponse*&amp; pResponse)
{
    /* The Asset Factory Manager that is invoking the loader is provided. It is important that
       any functionality that accesses the Asset Factory Manager use this pointer, as it
       is sure to be the one in the same thread as the loader.
    */
    EE_UNUSED_ARG(pFactoryManager);
    
    EE_ASSERT(pRequest);
    EE_ASSERT(pRequest-&gt;GetAssetPath().length());

    /* In order to track multiple simultaneous loads, we maintain a map from request message
       pointers to a block of response data. The <a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__BaseAssetFactory.htm">efd::BaseAssetFactory</a> class, from which
       the GenericAssetFactory is derived, provides some functionality to simplify the management
       of this data.
    */
    ResponseData* pData = 0;
    IAssetFactory::LoadStatus status = GetResponseDataAs&lt;ResponseData&gt;(pRequest, pData);

       something loading the requested URN, or the load is otherwise blocked.
    */
    if (status != IAssetFactory::LOAD_RUNNING)
    {
        return status;
    }

    /* HandleNewRequest opens the requested file, allocates a buffer for the data, creates

    if (!pData)
    {
        pData = HandleNewRequest(pRequest);
    }

    /* If an error occurred, say the file was not found, the response message has its error flag
       set. Note that LoadAsset returns LOAD_COMPLETE when the processing has been finished for
       an asset, regardless of the result of that processing. Error status or other information
       for the requestor should be included in the response message, as it is the only thing
       that finds its way back to the requesting code. 
    */
    if (pData-&gt;m_pResponse-&gt;GetResult() != AssetLoadResponse::ALR_Success)
    {
        pResponse = pData-&gt;m_pResponse;
        return IAssetFactory::LOAD_COMPLETE;
    }

       control the number of bytes read per tick. We cap any given tick to that size.
    */
    UInt32 fileSize = pData-&gt;m_pFile-&gt;GetFileSize();

    UInt32 bytesToRead = fileSize - pData-&gt;m_bytesRead;
    if (bytesToRead &gt; m_bytesPerTick)
        bytesToRead = m_bytesPerTick;

    if (bytesToRead &gt; 0)
    {
        UInt32 readSize = pData-&gt;m_pFile-&gt;Read(pData-&gt;m_pBuffer + pData-&gt;m_bytesRead, bytesToRead);
        EE_ASSERT(bytesToRead == readSize);
        pData-&gt;m_bytesRead += readSize;
    }

    /* If we have loaded all the data, we can clean up and set the output response message.
       That response parameter should only be set non-NULL when the load has completed and
       no more work can be done.

        return IAssetFactory::LOAD_COMPLETE;

       knows to invoke the loader again to load additional data. LOAD_BLOCKED should be returned

    */
    return IAssetFactory::LOAD_RUNNING;
}
</pre>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">efd::IAssetFactory::GetThreadSafety</span> function is called to
verify that a request for foreground or background loading may be met. It should return the
appropriate value for the thread safety status of the factory. If you appear to be having thread
contention issues with your loader, try setting this method to return foreground only as a
debugging step.</p>

<h2>Using Asset Location Services from an Asset Factory</h2>

<p>Due to thread safety issues in the Gamebryo messaging system, factories invoked in the
background thread cannot send or receive messages to foreground services. Special provision is made
for asset locate requests and responses because factories frequently require such services. Asset
Load Response messages also move to the foreground thread, but those must be returned from
<span class="NDLSystemFont">LoadAsset</span> calls.</p>

<p>If asset location is required, and the loader may be invoked in the foreground, it must register
its handler for asset locate responses. The examples in this section are from the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/egf/egf__WorldFactory.htm">egf::WorldFactory</a></span>
class.</p>
<pre>
EE_HANDLER_WRAP(WorldFactory, HandleAssetLocatorResponse, 
                AssetLocatorResponse, kMSGID_AssetLocatorResponse);
</pre>

<p>The factory must also subscribe to messages on the appropriate category. We strongly recommend
that this be done lazily when a request for a foreground load is first received. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">efd::BaseAssetFactory</span> class provides a member variable for tracking
subscription. The underlying reason for lazy subscription is that asset factories are not system
services, and hence do not have an <span class="NDLSystemFont">OnInit</span> function in which it
is safe to assume that a message service is ready for subscription. However, if processed inside an
asset load request you can assume that the message service is ready (otherwise the request would
never have been received).</p>

<p>When there is the potential for background invocation, the factory must also register a handler
with the Asset Factory Manager.</p>
<pre>
    pFactoryManager-&gt;RegisterAssetLocateHandler(m_privateCategory, this);
</pre>

<p>In order to register this way, the factory must implement the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__IAssetFactory.htm">efd::IAssetFactory::HandleAssetLocate</a></span>
member function. This function will be called by the background instance of the Asset Factory
Manager when an asset locate response on the registered category is passed from the foreground
thread.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether the factory is invoked in the foreground or background, all factory asset
locate requests must go through the Asset Factory Manager passed in to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">LoadAsset</span> function.</p>
<pre>
pFactoryManager-&gt;AssetLocate(urn, m_privateCategory);
</pre>

<p>Failure to do so will result in system instability if the factory is in the background.</p>

<p>Depending on whether the factory is in the foreground or background, the locate response message
will be delivered to either the statically registered message handler or the handler registered
with the Asset Factory Manager. Typically, the logic for handling the locate response is placed in
one handler and the other handler calls the first.</p>
