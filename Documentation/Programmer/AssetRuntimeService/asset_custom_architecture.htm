<h1>Architectural Choices Related to New Asset Types</h1>

<p>There are a few different ways to manage the loading of a new asset type. We can refer to these
implementation approaches as "Service-centric" and "Entity-centric." In both cases we are referring
to the code that interfaces to the <a href="asset_load_svcs_how_work.htm">Asset Factory
Manager</a>, sending asset load requests and handling asset load responses.</p>

<h2>Service-centric Asset Loading</h2>

<p>In the service-centric approach, you create a new system service that will manage the loading,
and perhaps the caching, for your newly defined asset data. If your assets are associated with
entities, then the system service will interface with the Scheduler (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/egf/egf__Scheduler.htm">egf::Scheduler</a></span>) and
Entity Manager (<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/egf/egf__EntityManager.htm">egf::EntityManager</a></span>) services to attach to
the entities. The basic program flow is that your new service subscribes to entity discovery
messages to find new entities that will use your asset type. When your service sees one of these
entities get created, it handles the loading of the asset. It will most likely also create an
association between the entity and the asset. That way, the lifecycle of each may be coordinated
with the other. This approach is most practical when only a small number of entities (if any)
require the asset, and when there are simplicity gains with having a central service that can
handle "<span class="NDLSystemFont">OnTick</span>" for all of the assets of this type.</p>

<h2>Entity-centric Asset Loading</h2>

<p>In the entity-centric approach, you create a new built-in model type that is mixed in with any
entities that will utilize your new asset type. Your built-in model object gets instanced along
with each entity that uses it. So, unlike the service-centric approach, there is an explicit and
automatic association between the entity and the asset data. Also, the asset data must be managed
in accordance with the life-cycle of its entity. There is no centralized manager of the asset data
as in the service-centric approach. This approach is most practical when each entity can easily
contain all the requisite functionality needed to manage its asset, and when it is likely that the
game will create many entities that refer to your new asset type.</p>

<p>One significant issue with the entity-centric approach is the lack of caching support when there
is no central service managing the assets. This makes it inappropriate for large assets that are
frequently re-used. A workaround in this case is a hybrid of the two approaches above. This gives
you the option of having a centralized system service that handles certain management functions for
your asset (for example, caching or pre-loading), along with a simple built-in model that
associates the asset data with each entity and controls its life-cycle. If you pursue the hybrid
approach, consider using reference counting so that both the system service and the built-in model
can easily retain references to a single in-memory copy of your asset.</p>
