<h1>Supporting Multiple Platforms</h1>

<p>The ability to support platform-optimized assets is critical
to the success of a project that is intended to ship on multiple
platforms. The Asset Runtime Service provides a mechanism for
these optimized assets to be selected at run-time. The system
works by tagging platform specific assets with the name of the
platform. For example, any assets optimized for the Xbox would be
tagged with the label "Xbox360". At run-time, the game inserts
this tag into all of its asset queries so that the appropriate
asset is returned by the system. In the case where there is no
optimized asset, the system returns a "generic version" of the
asset that is known to work acceptably on the platform.</p>

<p>The tags would normally be created for you automatically by
the Asset Controller. A sample implementation to perform the
tagging is provided in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SamplePlatTagger.cpp</span>. This sample relies
on a naming convention for the directories that contain the
platform-optimized assets. The functionality of this tagging
extension is controlled by a configuration file that is stored in
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root
Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-config/SamplePlatTagger.ini</span>.</p>

<pre>
; This configuration file controls the operation of the SamplePlatTagger auto-tagging
; class in the Asset Controller. The tagger will tag assets with a platform specific name
; so that the correct platform-specific asset can be loaded when the game is run on each
; platform. It works by looking at directory names below a parent directory, and matching
; the directory names that match one of the Platforms listed below.

[SamplePlatTagger]
; All directories immediately below the ParentDir will be checked to see if they are a platform
; name. If so, then a corresponding tag is applied to all assets below the platform directory.
ParentDir = GamebryoData

; The preceding "=" is required for the list. Additional platform names may be added here.
[SamplePlatTagger.Platforms]
; add classification tags for the console platforms
=PS3
=Xbox360
; add 3 classifications for Microsoft D3D versions
=DX9
=D3D10
=D3D11
</pre>

<p>Basically, the naming of the directories in the path to the
asset will determine which platform the asset is used for. This
same directory name is applied to the asset as a tag. Thus, the
assets can be distinguished from one another at run-time by
including the relevant tag in your asset lookups.</p>

<p>The AssetLocatorService provides a mechanism for injecting
tags into every lookup performed through the service. This is
done when the service is instantiated by including the additional
parameter for <span class="NDLSystemFont">GlobalTagSpace</span>.
For example:</p>

<pre>
// Create the Asset Locator service
efd::AssetLocatorServicePtr spAssetLocatorService = EE_NEW efd::AssetLocatorService(
    m_spServiceManager,
    "urn:Xbox360");
</pre>

<p>The inclusion of the "urn:Xbox360" value above will cause
every lookup to append the tag "Xbox360" to whatever other tags
are specifies. Thus, if this code is used on the Xbox 360
platform, then the correct optimized assets will be loaded into
the game without the loading code having to understand
platform.</p>
