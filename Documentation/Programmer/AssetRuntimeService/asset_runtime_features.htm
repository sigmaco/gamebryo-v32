<h1>Asset Infrastructure Features</h1>

<p>This section describes the major features of the Asset Infrastructure
and how they are accessed through the API and the various
configuration files and settings.</p>

<h2>Gamebryo Asset Types</h2>

<p>Gamebryo can utilize many different file types as game assets.
By default, the Asset Runtime Service recognizes the following
file types as assets:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Entity models&mdash;XML model files that are created in
    the Entity Modeling Tool (EMT) and exported as .flat
    files</li>

    <li>Entity sets&mdash;XML block files that are created in the
    World Builder tool and exported as .xblock files</li>

    <li>Game logic scripts&mdash;Scripts for any supported
    language that are used to implement entity behaviors</li>

    <li>Gamebryo scene graphs&mdash;The .nif files that the
    Gamebryo art pipeline produces</li>

    <li>Gamebryo animations&mdash;The various animation files
    (.kfm, .kf, .nif) that the Gamebryo art pipeline
    produces</li>

    <li>Gamebryo terrain data&mdash;Terrain data and materials
    that are exported as .dof and .tmpkg files</li>
    
    <li>Gamebryo time of day data&mdash;Time of day animation data
    that are exported as .tod files</li>

    <li>Sounds banks&mdash;Game sounds that are exported to .bnk
    sound bank files</li>

    <li>Bitmap images&mdash;Various types of bitmaps that can be
    used in the game</li>

    <li>Many shaders&mdash;Fx, Cg, HLSL, and various other format
    shader files</li>

    <li>Gamebryo input action maps&mdash; XML files used to define
    the mappings between input device events and game actions
    (.actionmap files)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can extend the Asset Infrastructure to recognize
additional file types as game assets. This enables you to add new
asset types quickly and easily. See <a href=
"asset_runtime_customize_asset_loaders.htm">Adding New Asset Types</a> for details.</p>

<h2>Asset Background Loading</h2>

<p>Almost all asset classe are background loaded by default in the Game Framework.
See the <a href="asset_load_svcs_overview.htm">Asset Loading Services Overview</a>
for an introduction.
</p>

<h2>Gamebryo Asset Organization</h2>

<p>The asset locating services enable you to organize game assets
into a directory structure that makes sense for your project.
However, the organization of the files should not be arbitrary or
improvised. Instead, we recommend that you adhere to a strictly
consistent process and set of conventions to determine which
directories are created, their contents, and the naming
conventions used to identify directories and files. The asset
locating services adapt to the organizational process and
conventions that you use.</p>

<h3>Asset Web Root Directory</h3>

<p>The Asset Web Root Directory is the top-level (root) directory
in which all of your game assets are stored. All assets that the
game will use must be located somewhere in the hierarchical file
system below the Asset Web Root. The Configuration Manager (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__ConfigManager.htm">efd::ConfigManager</a></span>)
provides the Asset Web Root Directory configuration value to the
Asset Location Service as <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AssetWeb.Path</span>.</p>

<h2>Asset Tagging</h2>

<p>The asset locating services cannot directly rely on path names
to locate asset files when they are needed during execution
because the files may be organized in almost any conceivable way.
Instead, the services utilize a tagging system that provides a
layer of organization that is independent from the directory
hierarchy. All assets that are stored beneath the Asset Web Root
are tagged so that the services can locate them without additional
configuration. This tagging information is stored in a
human-readable text database that is stored in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-metadata</span>.</p>

<p>An asset tag is simply a text label that is applied to one or
more assets so that the asset locating services can locate the
asset(s). Asset tags can be generated automatically by the Asset
Controller, or they can be created through an external/manual
process.</p>

<h3>Automatic Tagging</h3>

<p>Automatic tagging occurs when new assets are added to the
Asset Web Root and the Asset Controller first discovers them. A
configurable set of policies controls how new assets are
tagged.</p>

<h3>Automatic Tagging Policies</h3>

<p>The Asset Controller supports a pluggable system for adding
tagging policies. A C++ interface class (<span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__IAssetTagger.htm">efd::IAssetTagger</a></span>)
provides the base for the "Auto Tagger" classes, each of which
applies tags to the asset when it is discovered based upon how
the class is configured. In general, this functionality is
customized by editing a set of configuration files. There is one
configuration file for each Auto Tagger class. These
configuration files are stored alongside the assets in
<span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-config</span>
.</p>

<h3>Logical Assets and Variation</h3>

<p>A <em>logical asset</em> is a single asset in the game that is
implemented in multiple asset files, where each file provides a
unique variation. A very common example of this is
platform-specific graphical assets. Automatic tagging policies
support the identification of logical assets.</p>

<p>In a typical multi-platform game project, there will be asset
variations for each platform&mdash;Xbox360, PS3, and PC.
This represents a single logical asset that is stored as four
physical asset files, one for each variation. Identification of
logical assets is done by using conventions for the naming of the
directories and files where the variation files are stored. This
policy is expressed through the configuration files that are used
by the Asset Controller to tag assets as they are discovered.</p>

<h2>Asset Rapid Iteration</h2>

<p>Rapid iteration allows a game to be modified during its
execution. The Asset Runtime Service provides critical
functionality for rapid iteration. It does this by managing
notification messages as the assets that are used in the game are
modified. The Asset Controller monitors the entire set of assets
that are stored in the Asset Web Root and provides a channel to
communicate with the game. As asset files are changed on disk,
the game can respond to the resulting asset change notifications
by re-loading those assets, thus making the developer's change
immediately evident in the game. This allows for far faster
feedback and iteration of content than is possible with a
traditional programming cycle that involves restarting the
application. This can be particularly effective for console
development.</p>

<p>Rapid iteration works for many types of assets that are used
in the game. Block and model files, scripts, and serialized scene
graphs (NIF files) can all be iterated while the game is in
progress. You can rapidly iterate on the PC development platform
and on all supported consoles.</p>
