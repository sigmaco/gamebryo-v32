<h1>Customizing the Asset Tagging System</h1>

<h2>Customizing Asset Tagging Policies</h2>

<p>The Asset Tagging system is implemented in the Asset
Controller application. The Asset Controller creates the metadata
files that are stored in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-metadata</span>.
These metadata files specify the tag values and data that are
required to resolve asset IDs to asset files. How these tags are
defined and applied is largely configurable, allowing your
tagging "policy" to be tweaked through a combination of code
extensions and configuration settings.</p>

<h3>Setting policy via configuration files</h3>

<p>The Asset Web Root directory includes a subdirectory named
<span class="NDLSystemFont">asset-web-config</span>. Within this
subdirectory are a set of configuration files with <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">.ini</span> extensions. These are normal
configuration files that are read by the Configuration Manager
(<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__ConfigManager.htm">efd::ConfigManager</a></span>)
component. They provide a means of setting the policies for
tagging assets. Each <span class="NDLSystemFont">.ini</span> file
is specific to an Auto Tagging Extension that is part of the
Asset Controller application. For example, the settings in
<span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-config/MimeTagger.ini</span>
are specific to the "MimeTagger" extension that is implemented in
<span class="NDLSystemFont">MimeTagger.cpp</span>.</p>

<p>Each configuration file includes comments about what the settings do. The 
    presence of any <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">.ini</span> file with the extension&#39;s specific configuration 
    sections&nbsp; in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-config</span>
is what activates the extension. If there are no <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">.ini</span> files with the specific configuration sections, then the extension will not be
used when the Asset Controller assigns tags to new assets.</p>

<h3>Asset Tagging Extensions</h3>

<p>The other mechanism for customizing tagging policy is the use
of C++ extensions to the Asset Controller. These are created as
simple classes that inherit from <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__IAssetTagger.htm">efd::IAssetTagger</a></span>.</p>

<pre>
class IAssetTagger : public efd::IBase
{
public:
  virtual void GetTagValues(efd::vector&lt;efd::assettagdescriptor&gt;&amp; tags) = 0;
  virtual void DoTags(const efd::utf8string&amp; assetid, SimpleGraph&amp; triples) = 0;
};
</pre>

<p>The tagging extension need only implement the two methods
above to set tags on new assets as they are discovered by the
system. When the <span class="NDLSystemFont">DoTags()</span>
method is called, the tagging extension has access to all of the
properties of the new asset through its '<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">assetid</span>'. Using this, the tagging
extension may choose to set tags on the asset based on its file
name, path, extension, other tags values, or any other metadata
about the asset that it can extract.</p>

<h2>Example: Pre-caching graphical assets</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">SamplePrecacheTagger</span>
that is provided with the Asset Controller serves well as an
example of how asset tagging policies might be extended. The
purpose of this tagging extension is to apply a "Precache" tag
label to certain assets that should be preloaded by the game
prior to the entities that will use these assets even being
created. This is used to push the I/O cost of loading assets into
an initialization phase to prevent lag during the actual game
play phase. The assets that will be tagged are identified based
on the directories in which they are stored. The result is that
the collection of assets can be queried at runtime using the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">AssetLocate()</span> API using an
asset Id of the form "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">urn:<em>&lt;asset-type&gt;</em>:Precache</span>".</p>

<p>The extension is implemented in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SamplePrecacheTagger.cpp</span> and built as part
of the Asset Controller. Normally, the extension would be
dormant. It is only activated if you place a <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SamplePrecacheTagger.ini</span> file in your
<span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-config/</span>
directory. The contents of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">.ini</span> file are straightforward. It
specifies a list of directory names in the "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">SamplePrecacheTagger.Directories</span>"
variable, which are the directories whose assets should be tagged
with the "Precache" label.</p>

<pre>
; This configuration file controls the operation of the SamplePrecacheTagger
; auto-tagging class in the Asset Controller. The tagger will tag scene graph
; assets with the label "urn:Precache" so that they can be easily identified
; and preloaded by the run-time
[SamplePrecacheTagger]

; The preceding "=" is required for the list. Additional directory names may be added here.
[SamplePrecacheTagger.Directories]
=Characters
=FX
</pre>

<p>With the configuration settings in place, all assets that are
stored anywhere in the directory tree under either "Characters"
or "FX" will be tagged with the "Precache" label. As a result,
they can all be easily located. For example, all of .nif file
assets can be preloaded by using the "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">urn:gamebryo-scenegraph:Precache</span>" asset ID
to a suitable caching loader.</p>
