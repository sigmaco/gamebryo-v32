<h1>How the Asset Infrastructure Relates to the Emergent Game
Framework</h1>

<p>In the course of producing a game, it is necessary to employ
reliable methods for managing the game's assets. Depending on the
size of the game and numbers of assets, this task can become far
more daunting than the management of code. The Asset Infrastructure,
particularly the asset location services, strives to provide a means
to manage the chaos in a
manner that can scale with the project's needs</p>

<p>For small projects, the total assets may be able to be
organized into just a few sub-directories. If there is no need to
support logical assets (i.e. different physical asset files
intended for different platforms, locales, etc.), then the use of
asset tagging may not be required. The Asset Infrastructure can
be configured for these small projects, or a larger project can
be initiated without first having to confront these issues.</p>

<p>As a project grows in size and numbers of assets, the
directory structures and tagging required will also grow. The
Asset Runtime Service can be configured and extended to support
these needs. This allows the service to evolve with the needs of
the project by building on a base set of features; namely,
flexible configuration and asset tagging support.</p>

<p>All of the runtime system services that deal with assets in the Game Framework
make use of the Asset Infrastructure to locate and load files. The
asset infrastructure functionality is hence implicitly available to
applications built on the framework, and applications need to minimal
action to access it. Applications may also choose to extend the infrastructure
to <a href="asset_runtime_customize_asset_loaders.htm">new asset types</a>.
