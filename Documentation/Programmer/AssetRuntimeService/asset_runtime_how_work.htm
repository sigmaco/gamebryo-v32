<h1>How the Asset Locating Services Work</h1>

<p>The Asset Runtime Service comprises the Asset Locator Service,
Asset Controller application, the metadata that is created for
each asset set and the Rapid Iteration Service.</p>

<h2>Asset Locator Service</h2>

<p>Each application should include an instance of the Asset
Locator system service (<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__AssetLocatorService.htm">efd::AssetLocatorService</a></span>).
This service allows asset IDs to be resolved at run-time,
returning the location of the needed asset file(s). This asset
location functionality is provided by the service's <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">efd::AssetLocatorService::AssetLocate</span>
method.</p>

<p>All assets are referenced by the game through an asset ID. The
asset ID is provided in the form of a Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI) that is prefixed by the string "urn:", followed by one or
more specifiers. The additional specifiers for the asset ID may
be tag values, asset names, or logical or physical asset numeric
identifiers. Each specifier is separated by a colon.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>urn:gamebryo-scenegraph:Precache</em>&mdash;All assets
    that are tagged with <em>both</em> "gamebryo-scenegraph" and
    "Precache", which might be used to identify every asset that
    should be pre-loaded during application startup.</li>

    <li><em>urn:emergent-world:Level1</em>&mdash;An asset that is tagged with "emergent-world" and
        has the name of "Level1", which might be used to load all the entities needed in the
        first level of a game.</li>

    <li><em>urn:llid:0716a14d-81ca-46f2-9e7e-7dc30ff2c561:PS3</em>&mdash;A logical asset with the
        indicated unique ID <em>and also tagged</em> "PS3", which might be used to load the PS3
        variation of an asset selected with an asset-picker in a tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>Asset IDs may be used (or constructed) directly in C++ code or
scripts, but in most cases they will come from the contents of
other assets. For example, a block file will reference graphical
assets that are used by the entities that it contains. Therefore,
most asset IDs will be selected using a tool GUI in a way very
similar to selecting a file. Asset IDs will not normally be
manipulated or otherwise "handled" by the developers. It is
likely that most developers will not see asset IDs unless they
specifically look for them in data files or logs.</p>

<table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
    <tr align="left">
        <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD">
            <p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>

            <div class="NDLNote">
                The tag value that represents the asset type of
                the asset being queried has special importance.
                Unless you are using a Logical Asset ID (which
                always starts with "urn:llid"), all asset ID
                values should include the tag for the asset type.
                Asset type tags are the tags that correspond to
                the MIME type that is defined for the asset in
                the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web
                Root
                Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-config/MimeTagger.ini</span>
                configuration file.
            </div>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Asset Controller</h2>

<p>The Asset Controller is a Windows application that provides
additional runtime asset services for games and tools. It is also
the application that generates the metadata files that are used
by the game runtime to identify assets. The Gamebryo tools
require an Asset Controller to resolve asset files that are
selected in the tool by the developer. For this reason, the
Toolbench application automatically starts the Asset Controller
if it is not already running.</p>

<p>The fundamental reason for using a shared Asset Controller
over a distributed connection is so that all processes involved
in the session, such as editors and on-target previewers, will
see a consistent set of assets, even as they are being modified
in real time.</p>

<p>A game can run without connecting to an Asset Controller. If
there is no Asset Controller, then all asset IDs are resolved
locally by the Asset Locator. However, if the game is connected
to an Asset Controller, then all lookups are forwarded to it, and
the Asset Controller is able to provide results based on the
current state of the assets stored in the Asset Web Root. So
assets may be added, removed, or modified, and these changes are
available immediately within the context of the running game. It
is this connectivity that is used to support rapid iteration
workflows.</p>

<p>In summary, the Asset Controller has three main purposes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Create and update the metadata that is needed for
    locating assets. This is normally done by invoking the Asset
    Controller in a build step for the project.</li>

    <li>Serve asset lookup requests that the Toolbench initiates.
    Toolbench will ensure that there is always an Asset
    Controller running for this purpose.</li>

    <li>Monitor assets during rapid iteration workflows, making
    up-to-the-moment changes available to a running game.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Asset Metadata</h2>

<p>The Asset Runtime Service, normally within the Asset
Controller, creates source metadata about each asset that is
discovered in the Asset Web Root directory. This metadata is
stored in text files (.nt extension) within specially named
sub-directories under the Asset Web Root directory. The metadata
defines the various tags and property values associated with each
asset. These tags and values allow the assets to be queried by
the Asset Locator service using the URI syntax. The system
optimizes and caches metadata derived from the persisted source
metadata.</p>

<h3>Optimized Metadata</h3>

<p>The Asset Controller produces an optimized, indexed copy of
all the metadata and stores it in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root
Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-metadata</span> directory. This
optimized metadata is required for both the application and the
Asset Controller. The Asset Locator service will fail to find any
assets unless it either has access to local metadata or is
connected to an Asset Controller with valid metadata. For this
reason, we recommend that your build environment be setup to run
the Asset Controller as a build step. This will ensure that the
optimized metadata is up-to-date for each content build and that
the application can run successfully without requiring Toolbench
and the Asset Controller. When using pre-built optimized metadata
incremental changes will be folded into the application as a
developer changes the assets and re-builds the project.</p>

<h3>Persisted Metadata</h3>

<p>The optimized metadata can always be regenerated by the Asset
Controller. It does not need to be shared between developers or
committed to any central repository or revision control system.
However for certain projects there may be advantages to
persisting some or all of the asset metadata. For example, one
advantage of persisted metadata is the ability to arbitrarily
arrange files under the content directory root and move files
without invalidating asset references; this can be convenient
especially for very large projects. However, the Toolbench tools
do not currently assist in managing persistent metadata. None of
the samples included in LightSpeed are using persisted metadata.
For further information on the use of persisted metadata, see
<a href="asset_runtime_persist_metadata.htm">Persisting Your Asset Metadata</a>.</p>

<h2>Rapid Iteration Service</h2>

<p>The Rapid Iteration service provides the application side of
the communication channel between a running application and the
Asset Controller. This allows the game to receive notifications
when assets that it uses are added, removed, or updated. Many
types of assets can be hot-loaded into the game when such changes
are detected, thus providing a very efficient feedback cycle
during development. The Rapid Iteration service should be
instanced in your application during development, but not for
shipping versions.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>Any assets that do not get loaded via the Asset Runtime
service are not watched for rapid iteration. This includes files
referenced from within a NIF file, such as externally referenced
textures.</p>

<p>The Gamebryo core runtime components that load assets are
designed to be capable of safely replacing those assets in a
running game. Equivalent intelligence is required for new loaders
that want to take advantage of the rapid iteration feature.</p>

<p>Rapid iteration on shaders is currently unsupported.</p>
