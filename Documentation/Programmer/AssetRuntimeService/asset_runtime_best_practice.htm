<h1>Best Practices for Working with the Asset Infrastructure</h1>

<p>Emergent recommends the following best practices when you are working with the Asset
Infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Rapid Content Development on PC/Windows</h2>

<p>When you develop your game content on PC/Windows, you run the Toolbench application. Toolbench
runs the Asset Controller. If you want to see the changes that you make to your content as soon as
possible, include the Rapid Iteration Service in your game. You can observe many of the changes to
your content while the game is running.</p>

<p>For more information about adding the Rapid Iteration Service to your game, see <a href=
"../../Tutorials/Hello_World/hello_world_tutorial_more_services.htm">Hello World: Adding More Game
Framework Services</a>.</p>

<p>With Toolbench, Asset Controller, and your game all running on the same PC, you can make content
changes directly to the files that are stored in your Asset Web Root location (as referenced by the
game solution file loaded in Toolbench). You should also configure the running game to point to
this Asset Web Root location. The game will receive notification messages from the Asset Controller
as content files change. With the exception of a few restrictions, your game will reload changed
content files, and you will see the changes immediately.</p>

<p>It is also possible to configure the system to have the game and tools running on different
machines. This requires you to follow deployment prerequisites similar to when you are developing
on a console.</p>

<h2>Rapid Content Development on Game Consoles</h2>

<p>Rapid content development on a game console works pretty much the same as the PC/Windows. The
difference is that the game itself runs on the console. You will have to perform some setup and
configuration for the console and your assets.</p>

<p>As in the PC/Windows case, the game will receive notification messages for changed content files
from the Asset Controller. Additionally, the game will be able to download the content of the
changed file through the asset system so that it can be reloaded locally into the game. To support
this work flow, there are two initial requirements:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Before you start a development session, you need to sync the assets that are seen by the
    console file system with the assets in your Asset Web Root. The console will load all of its
    assets in the normal way, which could be either from a local hard drive or some sort of optical
    drive emulation system that utilizes a shared directory on your PC. This may require you to
    maintain a complete copy of the runtime assets in Asset Web Root on the file system that the
    console will use. If so, you need to sync this copy with the Asset Web Root before you start
    the game. After that point, the Asset Controller manages asset synchronization in-memory to
    update the game. For more information, see <a href=
    "asset_runtime_deploying_assets.htm">Deploying assets</a>.</li>

    <li>Network configuration may be required if the game is running in an environment where
    broadcast UDP traffic cannot travel between Asset Controller on your PC and the game. A common
    reason for this might be running a game on a remote PC or game console that is on a VPN or a
    different network subnet. In most situations this configuration is not required, however in
    this case the game must be configured to connect to the Asset Controller running on your
    development PC. This is handled by setting the Channel Manager configuration variables for the
    game configuration to the appropriate IP address and port number of the development PC.

        <p class="indent1"><span class="NDLSystemFont">[ChannelManager]<br>
        Hostname = 192.168.100.160<br>
        Port = 13215</span><br></p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Normal Development on All Platforms</h2>

<p>If you are focusing on code development rather than content development, and you want to iterate
on your code changes but without invoking Toolbench, you need to make some adjustment for the fact
that you are not running an Asset Controller. To run the game stand-alone, you must ensure that all
of the asset metadata is up-to-date when the game starts. The best way to ensure that this is the
case is to include a build step that runs the Asset Controller with a command-line that tells it to
just update the metadata and then exit. The following is an example:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">AssetController.EXE AssetWeb.Path=..\..\relative\path\to\assets
AssetWeb.ExportAndExit=true</span></p>

<p>This command will scan the asset web and update only the metadata that was affected by changes
to the assets since the last scan. It normally runs pretty quickly, even when your project contains
thousands of assets.</p>

<p>If you plan to run the game stand-alone on a console and without Toolbench and Asset Controller
running, then you will need to deploy both the assets and the optimized metadata to the console's
file system before the game can run as if the application were in a shipping configuration. See
<a href="asset_runtime_deploying_assets.htm">Deploying assets</a>.</p>

<p>Another important point for console development is that you will need to have a binary of the
Asset Controller available for the console build step to run. Otherwise, your build system will be
required to build the Asset Controller (for Windows) as a dependency for building your application
for the console. The easy solution is to check-in a binary of the Asset Controller so that it is
always available for build script purposes. However, if you are making changes to the Asset
Controller code, you must keep in mind to update this binary as well. Otherwise, you run a risk of
having different Asset Controller functionality when you build for Windows vs. consoles or when you
run the Asset Controller as part of your build script vs. running it with Toolbench.</p>

            <div class="NDLNote">
                Source distributions of Gamebryo LightSpeed include an Asset Controller binary that
                is a non-DLL Release build in the
                <em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Source\Tools\AssetController\bin directory. This binary is
                used for build scripts, as described above.
            </div>
        </td>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Run Toolbench before starting the application. This allows the common asset metadata to be
    used on application startup.</li>

    <li>Leave Asset Controller running during asset file updates such as editing in external tools
    and syncing from the central repository. This allows the optimized metadata to be immediately
    updated and reduces later startup delays.</li>

    <li>There should be no need to delete the optimized metadata and rebuild it for typical use
    cases. However, you should be aware that when you start the Asset Controller, asset files are
    scanned based on the timestamps of the directories. If you perform file operations that are not
    validly reflected by updated timestamps on your directories, then affected files may not be
    re-scanned. This is most easily corrected by just deleting the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-metadata</span> directory,
    then running the Asset Controller. A full scan of the asset files will take place.</li>

    <li>Temporary asset files that are regenerated can have persisted source metadata files if
    necessary.</li>

    <li>When writing code that deals with assets, avoid using file names or partial path names to
    refer to the asset. Assets are best identified by their logical asset ID. The physical file
    might be moved, renamed or overridden with a platform specific or localized asset while
    retaining the same logical asset ID. Furthermore, some assets might not have a direct file
    name; for example, an asset might be contained inside a zipped file.</li>
