<h1>Requirements for Working with the Asset Infrastructure</h1>

<p>There are many Gamebryo standard system services that are
responsible for loading game assets at run-time.  Some examples
are the Entity Loader Service, Flat Model Manager, Scenegraph
Service, and Shader Service.  All of these services require the
Asset Factory Manager and will
automatically take advantage of the Asset Locator Service when
you include it in your application.</p>

<h2>Using the Asset Factory Manager in your application</h2>

<p>Any application that loads Gamebryo supported assets must include
the <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_asset_factory_mgr.htm">
Asset Factory Manager</a> service. See the
<a href="asset_load_loading.htm">Loading Assets with the Asset Factory Manager</a>
page for the details of using this service.
</p>

<h2>Using the Asset Locator Service in your application</h2>

<p>The first step to using
the asset locating services is to instance the Asset Locator
Service in your application's Main() function.</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;efd/AssetLocatorService.h&gt;
...
AssetLocatorServicePtr spAssetLocatorService = EE_NEW AssetLocatorService(m_spServiceManager);
m_spServiceManager-&gt;RegisterSystemService(
    AssetLocatorService::CLASS_ID,
    spAssetLocatorService,
    ServiceManager::kSysServPrio_Normal);
</pre>

<p>Once you incorporate the service into your application, you
need to set up the service with some basic configuration.  The
critical configuration setting that your application will require
is the path to the Asset Web Root directory that has all the game
assets. Typically, you will have created this directory of assets
ahead of time, and specified it as part of creating your solution
file in the Gamebryo Toolbench.  The Asset Web Root path used for
your project in Toolbench will typically be the same path that
you configure the Asset Locator Service to use.  In your
application's main Config.ini file, you would specify this
variable as follows:</p>

<pre>
[AssetWeb]
Path = ../../relative/path/to/assets
</pre>

<p>Note that you will normally want to specify a relative path
for development on Windows.  This allows other developers to have
a different absolute path where the application binaries and
assets are stored without having to modify the config file. 
However, sometimes you will specify an absolute path here.  A
good example is the configuration provided for your application
when running on a game console.</p>

<p>Once you have correctly instanced the Asset Locator Service,
and given it the path it needs via configuration, the AssetLocate
API will function to resolve asset Id's to specific asset files
at runtime.  For the most part, all calls to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">efd::AssetLocatorService::AssetLocate</span>
already exist in the standard services that perform asset
loading.  You will generally only need to call the AssetLocate
API in your code if you are creating a new loader service for an
unsupported asset type.</p>

<h2>Preparing Asset Metadata for use by your application</h2>

<p>The Asset Runtime Service relies on optimized metadata files
that are stored in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web
Root Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-metadata</span>.  These files
are automatically created and updated by the Asset Controller
application.  In order for your game to correctly locate all of
the runtime assets that you have created in your Asset Web Root,
the Asset Controller must be given a chance to run prior to the
Asset Runtime Service initializing. The update process is
incremental, and will only process assets that have changed since
the last update.</p>

<p>The Asset Controller is automatically started by Toolbench
when you open a solution file.  As you manipulate your project in
Toolbench, and use other tools, the Asset Controller monitors for
file changes and updates the metadata accordingly.  It also
persists the changes in the metadata to your local asset web
periodically.</p>

<p>In addition to running Toolbench and opening your solution
file to update metadata, you can also incorporate the update as a
build step.  By running the AssetController from the commandline
during a build, the metadata is appropriately updated, and the
application is ready to run with latest asset changes. This
pre-built metadata could then be shared out to content
developers.</p>

<p>To summarize, there are two options for having your asset
metadata updated during the development process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your first option is to open Toolbench and your solution file.
  Allow it and the Asset Controller to run while you modify the
  files in your Asset Web Root.</li>
  
  <li>Your second option is to run the Asset Controller as a
  pre-build or post-build step to update the metadata associated
  with your game assets.  When there is little change to the
  content, this process executes very quickly, but major changes
  will slow down a build by several seconds.</li>

            <div class="NDLNote">
                If your game uses the Rapid Iteration System
                Service, all requests for assets will be funneled
                through the Asset Controller, and results will be
                based on the latest state of your assets.
