<h1>How Asset Loading Services Work</h1>

<p>There are three principal pieces to the asset loading
infrastructure.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The <span class="NDLEmphasis"><a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_asset_factory_mgr.htm">
    Asset Factory Manager</a></span> service is the central
    service point for asset creation. System services that
    require assets (worlds, entities, scripts, etc) send messages
    to the Asset Factory Manager requesting an instance of an
    asset. The manager handles all the details of locating the
    asset, locating any dependencies, and constructing the
    object. A response message containing the asset is then sent
    back to the requesting service. The Asset Factory Manager is
    a required service for any Gamebryo LightSpeed application
    that uses the Game Framework.</li>

    <li>Instances of an <span class="NDLEmphasis">Asset
    Factory</span> class (<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/efd/efd__IAssetFactory.htm">efd::IAssetFactory</a></span>)
    are registered with the Asset Factory Manager. Each factory
    is matched to a particular asset via the category for the
    response messages, found in each request message to the
    service. When the Asset Factory Manager receives a request,
    it locates the appropriate factory and invokes it to perform
    the load. All the logic necessary to load an asset and its
    dependencies is found in the asset factory for that type of
    asset. The loader may take multiple ticks to load the file,
    in which case the Asset Factory Manager will invoke it
    multiple times until the load is complete.</li>

    <li><span class="NDLEmphasis">Messages</span> of type
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/efd/efd__AssetLoadRequest.htm">efd::AssetLoadRequest</a></span>,
    <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "../../Reference/efd/efd__AssetLoadResponse.htm">efd::AssetLoadResponse</a></span>
    and derived classes are used to ask for an asset and to
    return the asset that is created, or an error status. A
    matching response is sent for every request.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sequence diagram below shows the most basic form of
foreground loading. The Message Service and some internals queue
management of the classes is ignored in this diagram.</p>

    <p class="FigureCaption">The UML sequence diagram for
    foreground loading, when no asset locate is required.</p>
</div>

<p>When the asset request contains a URN and no physical path,
the Asset Factory Manager handles the location of the asset. The
sequence diagram below shows this.</p>

    <p class="FigureCaption">The UML sequence diagram for
    foreground loading, when an asset locate is required.</p>
</div>

<p>Background loading is somewhat more complicated. The following
sequence diagram shows background loading. There are two
instances of the Asset Factory Manager, one in the foreground
thread and another in a thread created explicitly for background
loading. The background instance is created automatically by the
foreground instance. The two instances communicate through a
lock-free queue of messages. This queue communicates the request
and response messages, but may also be utilized by background
factories for asset locate and response messages. The diagram
shows an asset locate, which is skipped when the physical
location is given in the request.</p>

<h2>Application Interfaces to Asset Loading</h2>

<p>Applications typically access asset loading functionality in
one of two ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Indirectly through a system service, such as the <a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_entity_loader_svc.htm">
    Entity Loader Service</a> for loading worlds, or the <a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_input_svc.htm">Input
    Service</a> for loading input action maps. A message is
    typically sent when the asset is available, and the
    application must respond to that in some way. For example,
    Lua script preloading is initiated with the <a href=
    "../../Reference/egfLua/egf__SchedulerLua.htm">Lua
    Scheduler</a> <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">PreloadModule</span> method, and an
    application should handle <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/egf/egf__ScriptFactoryResponse.htm">
    ScriptFactoryResponse</a></span> messages to track when the
    scripts have loaded. See the <a href=
    "../../Tutorials/Base_Game/base_game_intro.htm">Base Game</a>
    tutorial for an example.</li>

    <li>Directly for non-standard asset types. Four basic steps
    are needed:

        <ul>
            <li>Create a factory for the asset class and register
            it with the Asset Factory Manager.</li>

            <li>Define a response message class for the asset,
            derived from <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
            "../../Reference/efd/efd__AssetLoadResponse.htm">efd::AssetLoadResponse</a></span>.
            The response message contains the data that is
            returned by the loader.</li>

            <li>Send a <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
            "../../Reference/efd/efd__AssetLoadRequest.htm">efd::AssetLoadRequest</a></span>-derived
            message to the Asset Factory Manager.</li>

            <li>Handle the response message when the asset is
            loaded.</li>
        </ul>A <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
        "../../Reference/efd/efd__GenericAssetFactory.htm">GenericAssetFactory</a></span>
        class is provided for loading raw data buffers,
        simplifying the first two steps above in some cases. See
        the <a href=
        "asset_runtime_customize_asset_loaders.htm">Custom
        Loaders</a> section for more information on loading
        application specific assets.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Foreground and Background Loading</h2>

<p>Loading may be done in either the main game thread or a
background thread. When the Asset Factory Manager instance is
constructed it creates a background thread running another
instance of the manager. The two instances communicate via
thread-safe message queues. The foreground instance of the
manager handles all interactions with services running in the
main game thread (via the <a href=
"../Messages/message_intro.htm">Message Service</a>), and loads
assets in the foreground. The background instance performs
loading tasks and provides message forwarding functionality for
Asset Factories running in the background.</p>

<p>The thread in which loading is done is determined by the load
request message and the available loaders for the asset type. See
the <a href="asset_load_loading.htm">Loading Assets with the
Asset Factory Manager</a> page for more information.</p>

<p>All the system services shipped with Gamebryo use background
loading for their assets, with the exception of the <a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_terrain_svc.htm">Terrain
Service</a> and the <a href=
"../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_shader_svc.htm">Shader
Service</a>.</p>

<h2>Asset Loading Order</h2>

<p>Asset loading is asynchronous, not only due to background
loading but also because the factory for an asset may need to
send messages and wait on responses, or wait for a dependent
asset to load. The loading of any given asset may become blocked
waiting on a locate or dependent load. Rather than stalling, the
Asset Factory Manager will try to load any other pending assets
when one factory is blocked. This allows loads to be completed
out of order.</p>

<p>The default behavior is to delay the response messages for
completed requests until any earlier request has been responded
to. This enables applications to rely on the ordering of asset
responses based on the request order. In-order loading is only
enforced on a per-thread basis. Loads that complete in the
foreground (or background) will not be delayed for an earlier
request in the other thread.</p>

<p>In-order loading may be preempted via a flag on the request
message. When the preemptive flag is set the request is processed
as fast as possible, before any in-order loads are processed.
Note that this does not mean the load will complete immediately
or even in a particular number of ticks, because the factory may
still need to send messages and wait on responses from other
services. Nor is it guaranteed that a preemptive load will always
be responded to before a pending in-order load. The latter may
finish while the preemptive load is blocked.</p>
