<h1>Asset Locator Services Overview</h1>

<p>Gamebryo LightSpeed's asset locator services provide systems that enable you
to do the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>lookup assets at runtime</li>

    <li>monitor existing assets for changes</li>

    <li>rapidly iterate on assets in a running application</li>
</ul>

<p>LightSpeed's asset infrastructure generates metadata that identifies your
assets. This metadata is used during locate requests to find the physical
location of the requested assets. By performing asset lookups based on metadata
instead of physical location, the asset locator services allow you to organize
your assets in a manner that is appropriate to your application and
platform.</p>

<p>Key components of the asset location infrastructure include the
following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Asset Locator Service&mdash;a system service that is used to locate
    assets without the need to hardcode asset paths in code. This service is
    used by various other system services to locate assets at runtime.</li>

    <li>Asset Controller&mdash;a Windows application that provides additional
    runtime asset services to your application and to tools. It is responsible
    for generating asset metadata used by the Asset Locator Service to locate
    assets. It also monitors these assets and generates asset change
    notifications for use during rapid iteration.</li>

    <li>Rapid Iteration Service&mdash;ties the Asset Locator Service and the
    Asset Controller together. It is responsible for connecting your
    application to the Asset Controller. This connection lets the application
    receive asset change notification messages. These asset changes are
    reported to interested system services so they can update assets at
    runtime.</li>
</ul>
