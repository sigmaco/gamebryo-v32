<h1>Asset Infrastructure Command Line Reference</h1>

<p>In addition to running alongside Toolbench, the Asset
Controller also has several useful features that are accessible
by using it as a command-line tool. This usage is handy for
incorporating functionality into your build system and for some
simple testing to troubleshoot problems with locating assets at
run-time.</p>

<h2>Testing Broken Asset Lookups</h2>

<p>You may experience the problem where certain assets that are
needed by your game are not being found by the <a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__AssetLocatorService.htm">efd::AssetLocatorService::AssetLocate</a>
API. One of the ways to troubleshoot this is to use the Asset
Controller to perform the lookup that is failing so you can more
easily inspect the problem. This is normally done by using the
command-line configuration parameters for "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AssetWeb.TestAndExit</span>" and "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AssetWeb.QueryTest#</span>":</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">AssetController.exe
AssetWeb.Path=../MyAwesomeGame
AssetWeb.QueryTest#=urn:gamebryo-scenegraph:ogre
AssetWeb.TestAndExit=True</span></p>

<p>The example sets the TestAndExit parameter to True which
causes the Asset Controller to exit after running all specified
tests. You can specify as many <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AssetWeb.QueryTest#</span> parameters as you need
on one command line. You can also specify all of these parameters
via a <span class="NDLSystemFont">Config.ini</span> file instead
of using the command line.</p>

<p>The results of the queries are reported in the log file. Most
Framework applications create log output when they run and Asset
Controller is no exception. The above example will produce output
in <span class="NDLSystemFont">AssetController.log</span>. Search
in the log for statements that include "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Test Result</span>" to see the results of each
query.</p>

<h2>Updating Asset Metadata</h2>

<p>A best practice for using the Asset Runtime Service is to
update the asset metadata whenever you re-build your application.
This is accomplished using the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AssetWeb.ExportAndExit</span> parameter:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">AssetController.exe
AssetWeb.Path=../MyAwesomeGame
AssetWeb.ExportAndExit=True</span></p>

<p>This command tells the Asset Controller to iterate over all
assets, updating the metadata as necessary for assets that were
added or removed. The system uses timestamps to keep track of
which directories have been affected by changes since the last
update. As a result when there are relatively few changes the
update executes very quickly.</p>

<p>On some occasions, you may want to forgo the intelligent
updating and generate all the metadata from scratch. This is the
approach to use if you have changed the tagging policy (in other
words, when you have modified the configuration files in
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root
Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-config/</span>) or if you have
performed extensive restructuring on your assets by modifying
directory names, adding/removing directories, or moving assets
into new locations. To do a full re-build of the metadata, simply
delete the old metadata directory at <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root
Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-metadata/</span> and then run the
Asset Controller as above using the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AssetWeb.ExportAndExit</span> command.</p>

<h2>Extracting Asset Listings</h2>

<p>At some stages of development you will need to deploy assets
to different locations. You will probably want to do this through
scripting. A handy feature of the Asset Controller is that you
can use it to generate lists of asset files that need to be
copied during deployment. This is done using the "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">AssetWeb.ListAssets</span>" parameter, for
example:</p>

<pre>AssetController.exe AssetWeb.Path=../MyAwesomeGame AssetWeb.ListAssets=urn:Xbox360</pre>

<p>This command will output a listing of all run-time assets that
are tagged with the platform variation "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Xbox360</span>" to a text file called "<span class=
"NDLSystemFont">ListAssets.txt</span>". This is done using the
normal rules for platform tags, meaning that there is automatic
fall back to more generic assets when the specific variation
requested does not exist. So this example would list all assets
required for the specified variation.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that if you use this method for deployment, you
need to also copy all the *.nt files from <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root
Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-metadata/</span> to your target
location.</p>

<h2>Running the AssetController Standalone</h2>

<p>The Asset Controller is normally started by just launching
Toolbench. When you open your game's solution file the Asset
Controller is automatically set to use the correct <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root Directory&gt;</em></span>
for the solution. However, it is possible to run Asset Controller
completely independent of Toolbench:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">AssetController.exe
AssetWeb.Path=../MyAwesomeGame</span></p>

<p>This command will start the Asset Controller and it will
continue to run until you exit it. A task tray icon will show you
its status. All of the normal asset monitoring functionality of
the Asset Controller will work in this configuration. Therefore,
you can perform Rapid Iteration work flows against this Asset
Controller even if Toolbench is not running. Simply start your
game and observe that the Asset Controller task tray icon turns
green when the game connects. At this point, you may use any tool
you desire to modify your assets. The game will receive
notification of these changes and will re-load the affected
assets if supported.</p>
