<h1>Simulation Debugger Settings</h1>

<p>
There are several Toolbench settings useful for customizing the behavior of Simulation Debugger.
These settings are split between general User settings and Content settings on specific game
solutions (.gsl). The game solution settings can be tuned to match the specific needs a game. All
settings are accessed via the Toolbench Settings editor in the Utilities menu. The default settings
values should be a reasonable starting point for all games.
</p>

<h2>User Settings</h2>

<h3>Sim Debugger | Auto Debug on Game Connect</h3>
<p>
Enabling this setting will allow Toolbench to automatically create a fresh debugging session
(.simdebug) whenever a game establishes a connection with Toolbench. This is very handy for
frequent users of Simulation Debugger. The generated documents will reside in the folder from which
Toolbench was launched.
</p>

<h3>Sim Debugger | Heat Map - Base Scale</h3>
<p>
This setting specifies the granularity of the database holding heat map data in world units. Smaller
values will yield more precise heat maps but will consume more resources. Heat maps are displayed in
the <a href="sim_debugger_worldview.htm">World View</a>.
</p>

<h3>Sim Debugger | Heat Map - Extents</h3>
<p>
This setting specifies the maximum world coordinate covered by a heat map. The grid of data used to
generate heat maps is always square and centered on the origin. Heat maps are displayed in the
<a href="sim_debugger_worldview.htm">World View</a>.
</p>

<h3>Sim Debugger | Snapshot Camera Z</h3>
<p>
When connected to a running game, double-clicking the Simulation Debugger World View will display a
top-down image of the game state at that location. This setting specifies the Z position of the
camera used to render these snapshots.
</p>

<h2>Game Solution Settings</h2>

<h3>Sim Debugger | Actor Facing Offset</h3>
<p>
The Simulation Debugger World View uses icons to represent entities in the world. Actor-based
entities include a vector indicating approximate facing. Depending on the export conventions of a
particular game's art assets, this facing indicator may be consistently off by some angle. An
angle can be specified in this setting to account for these coordinate system conventions.
</p>

<h3>Sim Debugger | Actor Update Buckets</h3>
<p>
This setting is a performance optimization for games with many entities active at once. It
specifies over how many frames the system should amortize the cost of checking for Actor-based
entity position and rotation updates. A higher number will be less taxing on the running game, but
could reduce the frequency of Actor updates to Toolbench.
</p>

<h3>Sim Debugger | Update Threshold - Position</h3>
<p>
Position and orientation are closely tracked for Actor-based entities. This setting determines how
far in 3D world space an Actor must move before triggering a notification for Simulation Debugger.
</p>

<h3>Sim Debugger | Update Threshold - Rotation</h3>
<p>
This threshold value specifies how far in degrees an Actor's facing (Yaw) must change before
triggering a notification for Simulation Debugger.
