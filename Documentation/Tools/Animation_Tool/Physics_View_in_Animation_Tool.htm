<h1>Physics View</h1>

<p>You can use the Physics View in the Animation Tool to specify forces that you want to exert on objects while they are simulating. The forces are saved and re-applied every time the simulation restarts. This enables you to apply a force and then change the view to see from various angles how the object behaves under the force.</p>

<p>To display this view, select <span class="NDLGUILabel">View > Physics View</span> or click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Physics View</span> button on the main toolbar.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
	<img src="images/animation_tool_main_toolbar_physics_view.png" width="361" height="81" alt="animation_tool_main_toolbar_physics_view (9K)" />
</div>
 
<p>While the Physics View is visible, you can float it, add it to a tab group, or dock it within the Animation Tool interface. Values that you specify in the Physics View are saved with the settings file for the current project and are available when the project is reloaded.</p>

			<td>Physical Sequences</td>

 ground plane. The friction and bounce values interact with the friction 
 and bounce of the model that is being simulated - the default is for the 
 collision to have the average of the two values. Hence, doubling the bounce 
 or friction of the ground may not double the apparent bounce or friction.</div>
