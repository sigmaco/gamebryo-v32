<h1>Edit View</h1>

<p>You can use the Edit View in the Animation Tool to examine and modify various editable properties of objects that you select within the Project View.  The contents of the Edit View are dependent on the context of what is currently selected.</p>

<p>To display this view, select <span class="NDLGUILabel">View > Edit View</span> or click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Edit View</span> button on the main toolbar.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
	<img src="images/animation_tool_main_toolbar_edit_view.png" width="362" height="81" alt="animation_tool_main_toolbar_edit_view (9K)" />
</div>

<p>The Edit View is designed to operate best with a vertical layout. It uses a roll-out mechanism for displaying various components of the currently selected item. The following screenshot of the Edit View for a sequence group illustrates a few of the view's typical components.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/EditView.jpg" width="300" height="684" />
    	<p class="FigureCaption">Edit View for sequence group</p>
</div>

<p>1. Roll-out Buttons&mdash;These buttons enable you to hide or un-hide sections. The screenshot shows one closed section followed by two opened sections.</p>

<p>2. Splitter Control&mdash;Occasionally, a section will have a splitter-control that enables you to expand the real estate for a particular region. This often occurs after a list of items. Resizing the list can make using a scroll bar for that list unnecessary.</p>

<p>3. Editable properties are available with various forms of input. In this example, various properties such as priority, weight, and so on are available. Additionally, you can set keystroke settings to activate each sequence in the group.</p>

<p>You can use the Edit View to perform almost any input modifications for a particular item. Though the screenshot above shows the available properties for a sequence group in the Edit View, similar object-specific properties are available for transitions, sequences, keystrokes for Interactive Preview, and so on.</p>


<h2>Edit View Editing Contexts</h2>

<p>There are numerous contexts in which the Edit View may 
 be used. A brief discussion of these contexts follow.</p>

<h2>Character Model</h2>

<p>The Edit View for the character model allows the user to specify the model to use by selection of 
 a NIF file. The view also allows the user to specify the model 
 root for the character model.</p>

<h2>Sequence and Sequence Group Folders</h2>

<p>When a folder is selected, the Edit View will display 
 buttons for the creation of additional folders and also for creating sequences or sequence groups, depending on the context.</p>

<a name=Interactive_Preview></a><h2>Interactive Preview</h2>

<p>If the Interactive Preview Item is selected, the user 
 enters a mode whereby they can activate sequences by using either keyboard 
 or mouse input. The appropriate transitions between each sequence will 
 occur automatically.</p>
 
<p>When the Edit View is under the Interactive Preview 
 context, the user is presented with two roll-outs.</p>
 
<p>In the first roll-out, the user can select the &quot;Idle 
 Sequence&quot; and also choose a sequence to activate from a list of the 
 available sequences. The user can simply &quot;check&quot; a sequence 
 to activate it. Sequences that cannot be transitioned to from the current 
 sequence are shown as grayed out in the check box list. The &quot;Idle 
 Sequence&quot; is the sequence that is activated when no keyboard keys 
 are pressed.</p>
 
<p>The second roll-out contains a list of all sequences 
 with their associated keystroke bindings. If no bindings are set, or if 
 the user wishes to change the existing bindings, the user can simply double-click 
 in the desired keystroke field and modify the binding keystroke (with 
 modifiers, if desired).</p>
 
<p>Upon entering a keystroke, the input focus will move 
 to the next keystroke field in the list so that the user can rapidly modify 
 all settings. At any time, the user can hit the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ESC</span> or <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">ENTER</span> key or select elsewhere with the mouse 
 to remove focus from the field. Note that for number pad keys, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NUMLOCK</span> 
 affects which key is generated by the Windows OS. With <span class="NDLSystemFont">NUMLOCK</span> 
 on, <span class="NDLSystemFont">SHIFT</span> + <span class="NDLSystemFont">NUMPAD8</span> 
 will generate the <span class="NDLSystemFont">UP</span> key. If <span class="NDLSystemFont">NUMLOCK</span> 
 is off, <span class="NDLSystemFont">SHIFT</span> + <span class="NDLSystemFont">NUMPAD8 
 </span>will generate the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SHIFT</span> + <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">UP</span> keys.

    	<p class="FigureCaption">Edit View for Interactive Preview</p>
</div>


<h2>Sequence IDs and Group IDs</h2>

<p>If, in the Project View, the user selects &quot;Sequence 
 ID Overview&quot; or &quot;Sequence Group ID Overview&quot;, then the 
 Edit View will contain a list box with the IDs in the left column and 
 the names of the sequences (or sequence groups) on the right.</p>
<p>The user can modify IDs simply by double-clicking in 
 the ID field and changing the value. When the user hits <span class="NDLSystemFont">Enter</span> 
 or <span class="NDLSystemFont">Tab</span>, the input focus will move to 
 the next ID field. This is a convenient way of rapidly changing ID's of sequences and sequence groups.</p>

    <img src="./images/EditView-SequenceID-Overview.jpg" width="311" height="186"
/>
    	<p class="FigureCaption">Edit View for Sequence ID Overview</p>
</div>


<a name=Interactive_Preview1></a><h2>Sequence Groups</h2>

<p>
If a <a href="Sequence_Groups.htm">Sequence 
 Group</a> is selected, the user enters a mode whereby they can edit and 
 test the parameter settings for the selected Sequence Group.</p>
 
<p>The first roll-out in the Edit View contains general 
 information about the Sequence Group. It informs the user about the Group 
 ID and Name of the selected Sequence Group.</p>
 
<p>The second roll-out is broken up into two sub-sections. 
 The first section is simply a list of all the sequences in the Sequence 
 Group with their associated weights. 
 To the left of each sequence listed is a check-box that indicates, when 
 checked, that the sequence 
 is active. The user can activate and deactivate sequences by simply clicking 
 on the check-box with the mouse or by using keys that have been assigned 
 to those sequences. This section is also a convenient way to quickly modify 
 the weights of all sequences in the group.</p>
<p>The second section of the roll-out allows the user to 
 modify the parameters of a particular sequence in the group. When the 
 user selects on a sequence from the list of sequences, that sequence will 
 have its properties displayed. The properties displayed will include:</p>
<ul>
	
	<li>Synchronize To&mdash;Shows which sequence, if any, is used for synchronization. The user is free to specify that no synchronization is to take place or, if preferred, 
 a particular sequence to synchronize to can be specified.</li>
	
	<li>Priority</li>
	
	<li>Weight</li>
	
	<li>Ease-In and Ease-Out</li>
	
	<li>Key Assignment&mdash;
	This is the key that can be used to activate and deactivate the sequence 
 within the Sequence Group. This value can be changed in the &quot;Keystroke 
 Settings&quot; roll-out as described below.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third roll-out is the &quot;Keystroke Settings&quot; 
 roll-out. It contains a list of all sequences with their associated keystroke 
 bindings. If no bindings are set, or if the user wishes to change the 
 existing bindings, the user can simply double-click in the desired keystroke 
 field and modify the binding keystroke (with modifiers, if desired).</p>
<p>Upon entering a keystroke, the input focus will move 
 to the next keystroke field in the list so that the user can rapidly modify 
 all settings. At any time, the user can hit the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ESC</span> or <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">ENTER</span> key or select elsewhere with the mouse 
 to remove focus from the field. Note that for number pad keys, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NUMLOCK</span> 
 affects which key is generated by the Windows OS. With <span class="NDLSystemFont">NUMLOCK</span> 
 on, <span class="NDLSystemFont">SHIFT</span> + <span class="NDLSystemFont">NUMPAD8</span> 
 will generate the <span class="NDLSystemFont">UP</span> key. If <span class="NDLSystemFont">NUMLOCK</span> 
 is off, <span class="NDLSystemFont">SHIFT</span> + <span class="NDLSystemFont">NUMPAD8 
 </span>will generate the <span class="NDLSystemFont">SHIFT</span> + <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">UP</span> keys.</p>

</div>

<h2>Transitions</h2>

<p>There are several transition types, each with different 
 parameters and editable properties. The following is a discussion of each 
 of the transitions and how they relate to the Edit View.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Delayed Blend


	<p class="indent1">When editing delayed blend transitions, the user can edit the duration of the blend. In 
 addition, new blend pairs may be created from existing text keys. To do 
 this, the user simply uses the two combo boxes featured at the bottom 
 of the dialog to choose the text keys indicating the frame in the source 
 sequence at which the transition should be started and the frame to blend 
 to in the destination. Then, the user just hits the &quot;Add&quot; button 
 to add the new pair to the list. To remove a blend pair, the user selects 
 the desired pair and clicks the &quot;Delete&quot; button.</p>
 
   <table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
      <tr align="left">
          <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD"><p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>
              <div class="NDLNote">Using the Transitions View, it is possible to select multiple Delayed Blend 
 type transitions at one time. When this happens, if no other transition 
 types are selected in the mix, the user is allowed to edit all the Delayed 
 Blend types all at once. The Blend Pairs section will only show Blend 
 Pairs that are common to all the Delayed Blend transitions selected. Also, 
 the user will only be allowed to add new Blend Pairs that are capable 
 of being added to each and every Delayed Blend type selected.
              </div>
          </td>
      </tr>
  </table>
 
 
<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/EditView-DelayedBlend.jpg" width="300" height="466" />
    	<p class="FigureCaption">Edit View for Delayed Blend</p>
</div>
 </li>

<li>Immediate Blend


<p class="indent1">Immediate blends are like their delayed blend counterparts except they do not have any of the blend pair controls. 
 Instead, the user can only choose a transition duration and a text key 
 indicating the frame in the destination to blend to.</p>
 
  <table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
      <tr align="left">
          <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD"><p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>
              <div class="NDLNote">When multiple Immediate Blend transitions are selected, only Durations may be edited.
              </div>
          </td>
      </tr>
  </table>

 </li>

 <li>Morph and Cross Fade


<p class="indent1">Morphs (synchronized) and cross fades (unsynchronized) only allow the user to specify the duration of the transition.</p>
 
  <table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
      <tr align="left">
          <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD"><p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>
              <div class="NDLNote">When multiple Morph or Cross Fade transitions are selected, the Duration may be edited and the result is applied to all the selected transitions.
              </div>
          </td>
      </tr>
  </table>

</li> 

<li>Default Sync and Default NonSync


<p class="indent1">When under the context of editing Default 
 Sync and Default NonSync transitions, the Edit View presents two buttons: one for changing the default settings and the other for making the transition &quot;unique&quot;. 
 Making a default transition unique will change its type to be the actual 
 type indicated by the default. For example, if Default NonSync transitions 
 are set to be a cross fade, making a Default NonSync transition unique 
 will change the transition type to Cross 
 Fade. Only when the transitions are unique can the duration be modified 
 for these transitions on an individual basis.</p>
 
   <table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
      <tr align="left">
          <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD"><p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>
              <div class="NDLNote">When multiple Default Sync or Default NonSync transitions are selected, they may all be made unique.
              </div>
          </td>
      </tr>
  </table>

</li>

	<li>Chain

<p class="indent1">	When a chain is selected, the complete chain transition will be shown in a list box 
 under the Chain Sequence section. The 
 user can specify the length of time for each transition in the chain (with 
 the exception of the source and destination sequences) by simply clicking 
 on the sequence and setting the duration in the &quot;Selected Sequence&quot; 
 section. This duration is the amount of time that the animation system 
 will wait after the previous transition is complete to trigger the next 
 transition in the chain. The default duration is set to wait until the 
 end of the current sequence before transitioning to the next sequence 
 in the chain, but the duration can also be specified in seconds.</p>
 
   <table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
      <tr align="left">
          <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD"><p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>
              <div class="NDLNote">Each transition in the chain uses the settings stored in the project to transition from the current sequence to the next sequence in the chain.
              </div>
          </td>
      </tr>
  </table>
	
	  <table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
      <tr align="left">
          <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD"><p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>
              <div class="NDLNote">Using the Transitions View, it is possible to select multiple Chain type 
 transitions at one time. If no other transition types are selected other 
 than Chains, the user will be allowed to edit all of the Chains at once.
              </div>
          </td>
      </tr>
  </table>


	<p class="indent1">The Chain Sequence section will only show 
 intermediate chains that are common (starting from the end of the chain) 
 to all the Chains selected. If any intermediates differ, the Chain Sequence 
 will display &quot;&lt;INTERMEDIATES DIFFER&gt;&quot; followed by the 
 common ones. Likewise, the text &quot;&lt;Multiple Sources&gt;&quot; and 
 &quot;&lt;Multiple Destinations&gt;&quot; will be shown if the source 
 or destination sequences are different among the selected.</p>
 
<p class="indent1">For intermediates that are in common, if 
 the durations for those intermediates are also in common, the duration 
 will be shown in parenthesis next to the intermediate and the user may 
 modify the durations in mass by selecting on that intermediate. If however, 
 the durations are different, the text &quot;(DURATIONS DIFFER)&quot; will 
 be shown instead and the user may not modify the durations in mass.</p>
 
<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/EditView-Chain.jpg" width="300" height="493" />
    	<p class="FigureCaption">Edit View for Chain</p>
</div>

<p class="indent1">The Edit View isn't completely sufficient 
 for real-time editing of chains, so the &quot;Edit Chain&quot; button 
 in the Edit View will spawn a modal dialog where further editing of the 
 chain can be achieved. That dialog appears below:</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/EditChainDialog.jpg" width="564" height="429" />
    	<p class="FigureCaption">Edit Chain dialog</p>
</div>

<p class="indent1">In this dialog, the user is shown the intermediate 
 sequences between the source and destination sequences of the chain on 
 the right half of the dialog. When adding sequences to the chain, the 
 user will typically want to see sequences that have a valid transition 
 specified from the last intermediate sequence in the chain. Other times, 
 the user may want to know what sequences have valid transitions that can 
 bridge the immediate last sequence and the final end sequence. For these 
 two scenarios, the user can select among the &quot;Possible Next Sequences&quot; 
 radio buttons, which will filter the sequences shown on the left half 
 of the dialog appropriately.</p>

<p class="indent1">When this dialog is used to edit chains 
 in mass, the user is free to add and delete common intermediates. If the 
 chains have intermediates that differ, this will be reflected in the &quot;Intermediate 
 Sequences&quot; section by the first entry reading &quot;&lt;INTERMEDIATES 
 DIFFER&gt;&quot;. Immediately following this entry will be a list of all 
 the common intermediates, if any. </p>
 
 </li>
</ul> 

<h2>Additional Notes on the Edit View with Multiple Selections</h2>

<p>Whenever multiple sections are made in the 
 Transition View, the Edit View attempts to allow the user to edit the 
 data that the transitions have in common. The one field that all transitions 
 have in common is &quot;Durations&quot; and is therefore always editable. 
 When multiple transitions are selected and the durations for the selected 
 are the same in every transition, then the value for &quot;Duration in 
 Seconds&quot; will indicate that value. If however, some of transitions 
 have durations of different values, the value for the field &quot;Duration 
 in Seconds&quot; will be 0.0 and will be printed in red text to indicate 
 such.</p>
