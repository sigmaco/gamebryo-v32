<h1>Animation Blending Overview</h1>

<p>In modern games and simulations, it is often desirable 
 to have two or more animations running simultaneously on the same character. 
 For instance, when transitioning from a walk animation to a run animation, 
 there will be a period in which the actor's movement will be somewhere 
 between the walk and the run. When two or more animations are simultaneously 
 affecting a character, animation blending must occur. The amount that 
 each animation contributes to the blend is called its weight. In the case 
 of the walk/run transition, the walk's weight is originally 1 and the 
 run's weight is 0. As time passes, the animation system will ramp the 
 walk's weight down to 0 and the run's weight will ramp up to 1. Halfway 
 through the blending operation, walk will be at 0.5 and run at 0.5. This 
 example is a very simple kind of blend known as a transition. A transition 
 is a blend from one animation to another with the intent of going from 
 a source animation to a destination animation.</p>

<p>Another animation blending example is mixing multiple 
 look animations. The actor could be looking directly above, directly below, 
 to the left, and to the right. It is possible to activate all four animation 
 sequences simultaneously and allow their weights to determine in which 
 direction the actor will look. If a looking up and right animation is 
 required, the weights would be as follows: 0.5 up, 0.0 down, 0.5 right, 
 0.0 left. If the target moves to down and left, the weights can be altered 
 over time to be 0.0 up, 0.5 down, 0.0 right, and 0.5 left. The actor will 
 move smoothly from one combination of animations to the other combination 
 as the weights are altered. Traditional IK approaches to this problem 
 would look unrealistic as simply moving the end effector of the head IK 
 chain does not necessarily move the upper body. When an actor looks up 
 or down in reality, they must alter their stance and torso. Better results 
 can be accomplished using blending since the artist maintains full control 
 over the upper body.</p>

<p>A third example of animation blending is walking and 
 shooting. An artist could create a shoot animation and a walk cycle. These 
 two can be blended together programmatically. This would have the effect 
 of watching the actor walk, fire a few shots while still walking, then 
 go back into swinging his arms for the walk cycle. The same shooting animation 
 could be blended on top of a run cycle. This form of animation blending 
 is useful in reducing the number of permutations of animations an artist 
 is required to generate.</p>

<p>A fourth example of animation blending is combining 
 multiple &quot;adverb&quot; animations to augment the basic &quot;verb&quot; 
 animation. Think of a plain walk cycle as an action, or verb. In print, 
 you can augment the description of the verb, &quot;walk&quot; with adverbs. 
 For example, &quot;he walked happily&quot; or &quot;he walked sadly&quot;. 
 The adverbs of &quot;happily&quot; and &quot;sadly&quot; can be expressed 
 as different versions of the walk animation cycle. Mixing the two examples 
 produces a spectrum of animations in the emotional range between &quot;happy&quot; 
 and &quot;sad&quot;. Further variations can be provided in the form of 
 &quot;injured&quot; to &quot;healthy&quot; or &quot;intelligent&quot; 
 to &quot;stupid&quot;.</p>
