<h1>Animation Blending Guidelines</h1>

<p>There are several guidelines and pitfalls to watch out 
 for when designing sequences to be blended together. The following rules 
 and their discussion should help prevent some of these common and sometimes 
 unintuitive pitfalls.</p>

<h4>Rule #1: Blending affects the amplitude of an animation, 
 not its frequency</h4>

<p>Let's take two sequences as an example. The first sequence 
 is of a ball moving forward over time as if it was just pushed. The second 
 sequence is of the ball not moving. When blending the two sequences together, 
 as the influence of the stationary ball is increased, the ball still moves 
 forward but at smaller increments. The timing, or frequency, of the forward 
 movement does not change. Only the distance traveled, or amplitude, changes 
 in this case. Please see Rule 3 to see how to affect the frequency of 
 the animation.</p>

<h4>Rule #2: Blending only interpolates between sequences</h4>

<p>Take the look up, down, left, and right sequences described 
 in the introduction. It is intuitive that combining up, down, left, and 
 right will not allow the actor to look backwards. However, it is less 
 intuitive that just using up, down, left, and right will not allow the 
 actor to look at a target on a rafter directly above the actor, yet slightly 
 to the left. The reason why this pose is impossible is because the sequence 
 group containing up, down, left, and right essentially defines a cone 
 directly in front of the actor. The target position in this case is outside 
 of the cone and therefore unreachable by the blending operation within 
 the sequence group. In order to achieve this final target position, an 
 additional sequence would need to be added to the sequence group, looking 
 all the way above the actor and to the left. Alternatively, the application 
 could move the actor backwards so that the position is within the target 
 cone.</p>

<h4>Rule #3: Blending often requires additional information 
 about sequences</h4>

<p>Let's take a common example, transitioning from a walk 
 to a run. In each of these sequences, the right and left feet of the character 
 will likely hit the ground at different times, since the run sequence 
 has a faster pace than the walk sequence. The two sequences may also have 
 different time ranges. A simple cross fade transition between the sequences 
 produces an odd result: the character appears to be moving forward by 
 shuffling his feet. This is because the foot plants are in a different 
 order or the times at which they occur in the sequences do not match. 
 To transition between these two sequences effectively, the time ranges 
 must be synchronized. Annotating the sequences so that it is clear when 
 the left foot and right foot are planted in each allows the animation 
 system to synchronize the two sequences. Essentially, time will be warped 
 so that the foot plants occur at the same time in both sequences.</p>

<h4>Rule #4: Blending involves normalized weights on each 
 animated attribute</h4>

<p>Different sequences affect different parts of the scene 
 graph. Depending on which sequences are currently activated, some scene 
 objects may be affected by many sequences while others are affected by 
 only one sequence. For example, let's take two sequences. One sequence 
 is a full body walk cycle. This walk cycle affects every scene object 
 in the scene graph. The second sequence is a wave sequence. It only affects 
 scene objects below the left shoulder in the scene graph. Blending both 
 with a weight of 1.0 each produces an animation where the walk cycle is 
 completely in effect everywhere except below the left shoulder in the 
 scene graph. Only at this point in the hierarchy is blending actually 
 occurring. Each scene object below the left shoulder takes the weight 
 of each sequence affecting it and normalizes its result on the final value. 
 In this case, the normalized weights end up being 0.5 walk and 0.5 wave 
 for the scene objects in common. In the scene objects where only walk 
 is active, the normalized weight is 1.0 walk. Now, let's try blending 
 the two sequences at 0.5 each. Nothing changes! Because the final weight 
 on each scene object is normalized to a total of 1.0, the final weights 
 are exactly the same as the previous example.</p>

<h4>Rule #5: Blending always uses Forward Kinematics</h4>

<p>There are two main methods available to most animators 
 in art packages, forward kinematics and inverse kinematics. Forward kinematics, 
 or FK, is the traditional process of &quot;tweening&quot; between two 
 key frames. Inverse Kinematics, or IK, attempts to resolve the transforms 
 necessary for a link in the hierarchy to reach a goal position. Animators 
 used to IK animation may enforce relationships such as two hands being 
 firmly attached to a staff. When blending in the animation system, only 
 FK is performed between the sequences. If the artist specified their animations 
 in IK, these animations are baked into keyframes for FK upon export from 
 their art tool. When blending the previously mentioned two-handed staff 
 sequence with an idle animation, it is entirely possible that the IK hand 
 placement will not be observed. When this occurs, it may be necessary 
 to add additional sequences to the blend to help smooth out these inconsistencies.</p>
