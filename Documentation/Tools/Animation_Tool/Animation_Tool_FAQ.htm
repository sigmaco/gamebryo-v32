<a name="Installation"></a><h2>Installation</h2>

<h2>Q: Why does the Animation Tool fail to load?</h2>

<h3>A: There may be a problem with a missing or incorrect environment variable, or some required software is not installed.</h3> 

<p>Make sure that the <span class="NDLSystemFont">EMERGENT_PATH</span> environment variable on your computer indicates the root directory of your Gamebryo installation. This should be automatically done by the Gamebryo installer. Also, make sure that you have installed the <a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/" target="_blank">.NET 
 framework</a>. If neither of these options are successful, visit Emergent's <a href="https://pulse.emergent.net/support/" target="_blank">Online Support Portal</a>.</p>

<a name="Basic"></a><h2>Basic</h2>

<h2>Q: What is animation blending and how is it useful to me?</h2>

<h3>A: Animation blending can help you optimize your animations.</h3>

<p>For more information about animation blending, see  
 <a href="Animation_Blending_Overview.htm">Animation Blending Overview</a>. Additionally, you can check out the <a HREF="Animation_Tool_Samples.htm">animation tool samples</a>.</p>

<h2>Q: How do you set up sequences for export in 3ds Max?</h2>

<h3>A: Emergent provides the 3ds Max Plug-in to help you set up sequences for export.</h3>

<p>For more information about using this plug-in, see <a href="../../Art/Max/Introduction_!Animation_Manager.htm">Introduction to the Animation Manager</a>.</p>

<h2>Q: How do you set up sequences for export in Maya?</h2>

<h3>A: Emergent provides the Animation Sequence Editor to help you set up sequences for export.</h3>

<p>For more information about using this tool, see <a href="../../Art/Maya/Animation_Sequence_Window.htm">Animation 
 Sequence Editor</a>.</p>

<h2>Q: When I make my keystroke assignments, why don't combinations of the Shift key plus number pad keys seem to register correctly?</h2>

<h3>A: There is a problem in how the system interprets keys when NumLock is on.</h3> 

<p>When NumLock is on and you assign a number pad key plus the Shift key, the Shift key is not recorded. Instead, some other functionally equivalent key will be used. The reason that this occurs is that the underlying code relies on what the system thinks was pressed. In the case described, the keystroke combination is functionally equivalent to a single keystroke. So for example, SHIFT + NumberPad8 will equate to the Up key. In the interactive preview, you can still press SHIFT + NumberPad8, but you can also press the up arrow key.</p>

<h2>Q: Why do some of my keystroke assignments show up as &quot;D1&quot;, &quot;D2&quot;, and so on?</h2>

<h3>This is an artifact of how Windows reports number keys on the main keyboard.</h3>

<p>A: Windows reports the number keys on the main keyboard with a prefix of &quot;D&quot; to distinguish them from the numeric keypad keys. If you see &quot;D5&quot;, that means the &quot;5&quot; key on the main keyboard.</p>

<a name="Sequences"></a><h2>Sequences</h2>

<h2>Q: Why is it that when I view my sequence, the playback time slider runs to the end and stops? I notice that the time continues to run up.</h2>

<h3>A: This happens with CLAMP sequences.</h3>

<p>This is expected behavior, but it can be confusing if you have been dealing with LOOP sequences for a while.</p>

<a name="SequenceGroups"></a><h2>Sequence Groups</h2>

<h2>Q: My blends don't behave the way I thought they would. What might be wrong?</h2>

<h3>A: There are several common issues that can pop up when you are dealing with animation blending.</h3>


<p>For more information about these issues, see <a HREF="Animation_Blending_Guidelines.htm">Animation Blending Guidelines</a>.</p>

<h2>Q: When I attempt to activate or deactivate a sequence from the sequence group, the Animation Tool does not always recognize my mouse click.</h2>

<h3>A: Sequences cannot be activated or deactivated while they are easing-in or easing-out.</h3>

<p>When you attempt to do this, a message will be sent to the General channel in the Output View. You might encounter this issue with longer Ease-In and Ease-Out times or if you lower the playback rate.</p>

<a name="InteractivePreview"></a><h2>Interactive Preview</h2>

<h2>Q: My animation won't leave the Idle Sequence or my animation never returns to the Idle Sequence. What is wrong?</h2>

<h3>A: This is probably due to a problem with transitions.</h3>

<p>From the idle sequence, transitions are needed for the entire trip. This involves at least two transitions. If you have set up your keystrokes, but you cannot seem to trigger the transition from the idle sequence, then check to ensure that you actually have the desired transition defined in the Transition View. If the issue is that the animation never returns back to the Idle Sequence, then you probably do not have a transition for the return trip. Make sure you also have a transition set up for the reverse. Because this view is interactive, the issue may also arise by way of transition from a non-idle sequences to a sequence for which there is no return to idle transition defined.</p>

<a name="Transitions"></a><h2>Transitions</h2>

<h2>Q: Why does the playback time slider indicate a certain time spent in the source and destination, but in actuality, the time loops prematurely or lasts longer than expected?</h2>

<h3>A: There can be a slight difference between the playback time slider's predicted time and real-time.</h3> 

<p>The playback time slider predicts how much time is going to be spent in the source and destination based on where you position the transition marker. This predicted time is based somewhat on a &quot;perfect world&quot;, which in reality is not what the application runs in. The application is using real time and feeds this time to the Animation System. Because the Animation System is operating on real time, the actual time step used varies from frame to frame. In some cases, the time immediately after a transition can occur just prior to the end of a sequence or just after. Depending on which, an extra loop of the sequence may be issued. This usually occurs when the end of transition falls on end of sequence thresholds of the destination sequence. </p>

<h2>Q: Why doesn't my transition start at the location time of my transition marker?</h2>

<h3>A: This probably has something to do with a delayed blend.</h3>

<p>Delayed blends are unique in that the transition will not occur until the first blend pair is reached (indicated by the dark arrows on the time slider playback). No matter where the transition marker (the desired transition) is positioned, the actual transition will not occur until the next black arrow (blend pair) is reached.</p>
