<h1>Animation Tool Samples</h1>

<p>The Gamebryo Animation Tool ships with several sample characters that demonstrate facets of the tool. We recommend that you experiment with these samples. Each sample contains source art files so you can re-export Gamebryo assets.</p>

<p>You can find the samples in the following location:</p>

<h2>Killbot</h2>

<p>Killbot was designed as a next-generation character for video
games. He has a large number of bones and has a custom rigged
skeleton in 3ds Max. This model uses pixel and vertex shader model 2.0. Certain graphics cards might not be able to render this sample properly. If this occurs, you can load a secondary model that does not use the shader.</p>

<p>Killbot also has several sequence groups pre-defined that allow you to play around with animation blending in different scenarios.</p>

</div>

<h2>CyberMonkey</h2>

<p>The CyberMonkey character was modeled in Maya to demonstrate
advanced character rigging techniques with an extensive set of
hand-to-hand combat maneuvers.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">

    <p class="FigureCaption">CyberMonkey</p>
</div>

<h2>Rocky</h2>

<p>Rocky is a 3ds Max model that has three animation sequences
defined. The "pound" animation shows off a sequence that contains
particle emitters and morphed geometry on top of the standard
bone hierarchy animation. The animation system supports sequences
containing any value that can be animated in Gamebryo.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">

    <p class="FigureCaption">Rocky</p>
</div>

<h2>DestroyerBot</h2>

<p>The DestroyerBot is a Maya model that represents a complex
character with multiple layers of animation. This model features skinning, animated lights, billboards, and advanced particle systems.</p>

<p>The "Walk" and "Run" sequences show morph transitions. The
shield and cloaking sequence display chain transitions as well as
layered sequences. All movement sequences utilize animation
accumulation.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">

</div>

<h2>Soldier</h2>

<p>The Soldier model has examples of many different types of
transitions. This character is also a great sample to show off
transformation accumulation.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/Soldier.jpg" width="315" height="369"> 
    <p class="FigureCaption">Soldier</p>
</div>

<h2>BabyLenguin</h2>

<p>Baby Lenguin is a character that shows off particle systems
and bone animation in several sequences. This sample also has a wide variety of idle sequences.</p>

<p>Several sequences have morph tags indicating the left and
right foot down placement with the strings "lfd" and "rfd". These
keys can only be created in the source content creation
package.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/BabyLenguin.jpg" width="254" height="265">
    <p class="FigureCaption">Baby Lenguin</p>
</div>

<h2>Skeleton</h2>

<p>The skeleton is an example of the use of layer roots. In this
case, the character has a layer root defined at the lower spine
bone. With such a root it is possible to define sequences that
affect only the upper portion of the character.</p>

</div>

<a name="Jack"></a><h2>Jack</h2>

<p>Jack is an example of the use of additive blending.  This KFM has a pre-created sequence group with the LeanLeft, LeanRight, and BigHead sequences all selected as being additive.  You can adjust the weights to make Jack additively lean left or right while running or idle.  Try comparing the difference between using LeanLeft or LeanRight as an additive sequence versus a normal blend.</p>
