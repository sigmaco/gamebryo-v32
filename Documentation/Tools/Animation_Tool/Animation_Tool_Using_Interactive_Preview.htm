<h1>Using the Interactive Preview in the Animation Tool</h1>

<p>You can use the Animation Tool to preview transitions between animations in a free-form environment.</p>

<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">To use the interactive preview</p>

<ol>
	
	<li>Launch the Animation Tool and load a .KFM file that you want to work with. For example: 

<p class="indent1"><span class="NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Samples\Models\AnimationToolExamples\Tutorial\Tutorial2.kfm</span></p>
	</li>
	
	<li>Select <span class="NDLGUILabel">Interactive Preview</span> in the Project View. (You can also select this from the main toolbar.)

	<p class="indent1">The application enters Interactive Preview mode. You can see this by examining the Edit View.</p>

    <div class="FigureContainer">
        <img src="./images/3_1_BindPoseIdle.jpg" width="307" height="362"
    />
        <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
    </div>


	<p class="indent1">Note that nothing is animating. This is because the bind_pose sequence is the current <span class="NDLGUILabel">Idle Sequence</span>, and it has no animations. The <span class="NDLGUILabel">Idle Sequence</span> is the default sequence that the Interactive Preview tries to play when no other sequence is active. Select a different sequence. For example, if you are working with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Tutorial2.kfm</span> sample, select idle01_front from the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Idle Sequence</span> drop-down list. The idle01_front sequence starts animating.</p>
	
    <div class="FigureContainer">
        <img src="./images/3_2_SelectingIdleFront.jpg" width="308" height="358"
    />
        <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
    </div>
	</li>
	
	<li>There are two ways to preview sequences and their transitions in the Interactive Preview. The first way is to click the sequence that you want in the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Current Sequence</span> list. For example, if you are working with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Tutorial2.kfm</span> sample, click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">walk</span> sequence. Notice that the character transitions from theidle01_front sequence to the walk sequence. The engine will continue to play that sequence until you select a different item from the list. If no transition is specified from the currently animating sequence to another sequence in the list, that sequence will be grayed out in the list and you will not be able to select it.


    <div class="FigureContainer">
        <img src="./images/3_3_SelectingWalk.jpg" width="306" height="355"
    />
        <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
    </div>

	<p class="indent1">Change the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Current Sequence</span> back to its previous state. If you are working with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Tutorial2.kfm</span> sample, select <span class="NDLGUILabel">idle01_front</span> for now.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>The second method of activating sequences in Interactive Preview is through keyboard shortcuts. Open the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Keystroke Settings</span> rollout. This rollout contains all of the currently enabled keyboard shortcuts for the Interactive Preview. If you are working with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Tutorial2.kfm</span> sample, this rollout is currently empty.

      <div class="FigureContainer">
          <img src="./images/3_4_ExpandedKeystrokeBindings.jpg" width="301" height="447"
      />
          <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
      </div>
	</li>
	
	<li>If necessary, drag the size bar at bottom of the dialog to fit all the entries on the screen without needing a scroll bar. The size bar is the grey rectangle at the bottom of the grid. (Many controls in the Animation Tool contain size bars like this that let you resize their contents to suit your preferences.</li>

	<li>Double-click the sequence entry to which you want to assign a keystroke. Then, press the keyboard key that you want to assign to the sequence.  For example, if you are working with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Tutorial2.kfm</span> sample, press the Up arrow key on the keyboard. This changes the keystroke assigned to the walk sequence in the chart to Up.

      <div class="FigureContainer">
          <img src="./images/3_5_WalkKeystroke.jpg" width="302" height="442"
      />
          <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
      </div>


	<p class="indent1">Assign other keystrokes as needed. If you are working with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Tutorial2.kfm</span> sample, double-click the run sequence, hold down the Shift key, and press the Up arrow key. This changes the keystroke assigned to run in the chart to Shift and Up simultaneously. The Animation Tool detects Shift, Ctrl, and Alt as modifier keys when you hold them down while specifying a keystroke.</p>

      <div class="FigureContainer">
          <img src="./images/3_6_RunKeystroke.jpg" width="300" height="444"
      />
          <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
      </div>
	 </li>
	 
	 <li>Click either the Render View or the Edit View. Keyboard shortcuts only work in these two views.</li>

	<li>Test the keystrokes that you assigned. For example, if you are working with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Tutorial2.kfm</span> sample, press the Up arrow key. The Interactive Preview transitions from idle01_front to walk. When you release the Up arrow key, the Interactive Preview returns to the idle01_front sequence. Hold down the Up arrow key again. This activates the walk sequence. Now hold down the Shift key without releasing the Up arrow key. This triggers the transition from walk to run. <!-- Note that in the previous tutorial we set up &quot;walk&quot; to &quot;run&quot; to be a chain transition 
 with &quot;jump&quot; as the intermediate sequence, so you will see that 
 jump now. --></li>
 
 <li>Save the current project<!--  as &quot;Tutorial3.kfm&quot; -->.
