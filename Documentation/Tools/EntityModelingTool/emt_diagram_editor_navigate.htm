<h1>Navigating in the Mix-in/Diagram Editor</h1>

<p>When defining mix-ins and creating diagrams, you can have many
different models and presets within the editor. At different
points in the process, you may want to get a strategic view of
the entire mix-in/diagram and at other times you may want to focus
in on a specific model or group of models. For this reason, both
editors have zoom and scroll tools. These tools allow you to
quickly and easily navigate the models and presets within the
diagram.</p>

<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">To navigate the Mix-in/Diagram
Editor</p>

<ul>
    <li>In the EMT Project Explorer, do one of the following:

        <ul>
            <li>Double-click a model or preset to load it into
            the Mix-in Editor.</li>

            <li>Double-click a diagram to load it into the
            Diagram Editor.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>In the Diagram Editor, double-clicking a model will open it in the Mix-in Editor.</li>
    
    <li>In the Mix-in Editor, double-clicking a model will regenerate the view focused on that model.
    This is an easy way to explore up or down the mix-in chain.</li>

    <li>Drag the Zoom slider in the top right corner of the
    editor to zoom in and out. Drag to the left to zoom out and
    to the right to zoom in. (The mouse wheel also zooms in and
    out of the editor.)</li>

    <li>To center the models use the scroll sliders at the bottom
    and right side of the editor.  In the Diagram Editor, there is also a
    Zoom To Fit toolbar button. Finally, dragging
    the middle mouse button will pan the view.</li>
</ul>
