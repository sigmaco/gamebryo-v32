<h1>EMT Project Explorer</h1>

<p>The EMT Project Explorer is the primary means for organizing and accessing entity modeling
content. By default, it is visible in a left-docked pane when an EMT project is opened.</p>

<p>Entity models and presets can be dragged from this view and dropped into Diagram Editor and
Mix-in Editor.</p>

<p>A thumbnail image and description for the selected content is displayed at the bottom of the
view.</p>

<p>The view has two modes for working with EMT content. They operate similarly to how Windows
Explorer works with the file system.</p>

<h2>Browse Mode</h2>

<p>The Browse tab is used for navigating a virtual folder hierarchy of EMT content. This may be
done exclusively in the Contents sub-pane to conserve screen space. Alternatively, the Folders
sub-pane can be added on the left for greater flexibility. There is a draggable splitter between
the two sub-panes to specify how the space should be shared.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/project_explorer_browse.png" width="476" height="515" alt="Project Explorer - Browse mode (44K)" />
        <p class="FigureCaption">Project Explorer - Browse mode</p>
</div>

<p>The root of the hierarchy contains the open EMT project and read-only links to all projects it
references. Within these projects are entity models, presets, diagrams, and virtual folders.
Virtual folders can in turn contain additional EMT content, including virtual subfolders.</p>

<p>There are several controls for navigating and editing the content hierarchy in Browse Mode.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use the Location breadcrumb control at the top of the pane to quickly move between folders
    and referenced EMT projects.</li>

    <li>Use the Filter edit box to specify a substring that limits the display of items at the
    current level in the hierarchy.</li>

    <li>Use the Folders sub-pane to expand, collapse, and view different folders and projects.</li>

    <li>Double-click folders in the Contents sub-pane to navigate into them.</li>

    <li>Use the backspace key to navigate up one level in the virtual hierarchy.</li>

    <li>Drag and drop items within or between the two sub-panes to reorganize content.</li>
</ul>

<table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
    <tr align="left">
        <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD">
            <p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>

            <div class="NDLNote">
                It is important to remember that the EMT Project Explorer contains the items in one
                open EMT project, plus <b>read-only</b> access to items in all <b>referenced</b>
                EMT projects. Project references are managed in the Game Solution view. Items
                cannot be moved from the open EMT project into a referenced project. Similarly,
                items cannot be moved between referenced projects.
            </div>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Organizational work done in the EMT Project Explorer will also be leveraged by the World Builder
Palette view, which uses a similar UI to present the same virtual hierarchy. However, the virtual
hierarchy can only be modified in the Entity Modeling Tool.</p>

<h2>Search Mode</h2>

<p>The Search tab is used to quickly locate EMT content that might be scattered throughout an EMT
project or even multiple referenced projects. The query-building controls provide several different
criteria for searches. Matching entity models and presets are returned in the Results
list.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/project_explorer_search.png" width="477" height="513" alt="Project Explorer - Search mode (32K)" />
        <p class="FigureCaption">Project Explorer - Search mode</p>
</div>

<p>A checkbox to the left of each option determines which search criteria are active. The Advanced
rollout can be expanded for access to additional search options. The Execute Query button performs
the search. If the EMT Project Explorer view has focus, simply hitting the enter key will also
perform the search. The following search parameters can be specified.</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Search Parameter</th>

            <th>Details</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Search Under</td>

            <td>Specify an EMT project to search, or uncheck to search all referenced
            projects.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Name Includes</td>

            <td>Specify a substring to find in model and preset names.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Has Mixin</td>

            <td>Specify a model name substring that must be mixed in.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Has Property</td>

            <td>Specify a property name substring that must be present.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Has Behavior</td>

            <td>Specify a behavior name substring that must be present.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Results are listed with Name and Virtual Path. The path reflects the EMT project and virtual
folders that contain an item.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>EMT content items listed in both Browse and Search tabs provide context menus with a variety of
commands. The available commands depend on the type and context of content selected. EMT Project
Explorer supports multi-select, which will limit the available commands. Note also that different
commands are available when the selected content is from a referenced EMT project.</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Command</th>

            <th>Details</th>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Open</td>

            <td>Opens the selected item for viewing or editing. Models and presets open in the
            Mix-in Editor. Diagrams open in the Diagram Editor. Open is the default command when
            double-clicking an item.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Open in Project</td>

            <td>Opens the selected item from a referenced project in its own project context. This
            is necessary for editing referenced items.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Delete</td>

            <td>Deletes the selected items from the project.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>

        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>View Asset</td>

            <td>Opens an external tool for viewing the NIF or KFM asset associated with the
            selected entity model or preset. This feature is configured in user settings.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Browse to Location</td>

            <td>When used in Search Mode, this command will transition the view to Browse mode,
            arriving at the virtual path of the selected item.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Add &gt; New Model</td>

            <td>Creates a new entity model in the current virtual folder.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Add &gt; New Preset</td>

            <td>Creates a new preset in the current virtual folder.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Add &gt; New Diagram</td>

            <td>Creates a new diagram in the current virtual folder.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Add &gt; New Folder</td>

            <td>Creates a new virtual folder as a child of the current virtual folder.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Revision Control &gt; Add / Edit</td>

            <td>Adds new files to revision control or checks them out if they already exists.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Revision Control &gt; Refresh</td>

            <td>Updates the displayed status of all revision-controlled files.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Thumbnails View</h2>

<p>Each mode of EMT Project Explorer can be configured to use either of two visualizations. These
visualizations are toggled via the Views dropdown. The default visualization is Details.</p>

<p>Thumbnails view can be useful for quickly locating entity models and presets that have
associated visual assets.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/project_explorer_thumbnails.png" width="477" height="515" alt="Project Explorer - Thumbnails View (51K)" />
        <p class="FigureCaption">Project Explorer - Thumbnails View</p>
</div>

<p>The Zoom slider controls the size of the thumbnail images, trading image detail for viewable
image count. Hovering over the label for a thumbnail will display a tooltip with the full name and
virtual path of the item.</p>

<p>The thumbnails are provided via the <a href=
"../NiThumbnailExtractor/NiThumbnailExtractor_Intro.htm">NiThumbnailExtractor COM DLL</a>.</p>
