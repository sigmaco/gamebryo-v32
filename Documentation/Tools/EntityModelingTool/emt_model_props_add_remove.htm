<h1>Adding/Removing Properties from an Entity Model</h1>

<p>You can add properties to a model to define its specific
attributes. A property is a member variable of a model that has a
data type, and an initial/default value. Each property also has
specific traits, which control the automated management of the
property, such as whether it is persisted, or can be accessed on
a client. You can add any number of properties to a model.
Properties can also be easily removed when they are no longer
required.</p>

<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">To add a property to an entity
model</p>

<ol>
    <li>Load an entity model into the Mix-in Editor. (You can also select a model in a diagram to load it into the Entity Model Editor.)

        <p class="indent1">A list of the model's properties and
        behaviors is displayed in the Entity Model Editor.</p>
    </li>

    <li>In the Properties section of the Entity Model Editor,
    click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Add</span> button. (You can also add a new property by right-clicking a row in the Property list and selecting Insert from the context menu.)</li>

    <li style="list-style: none">
        <p class="indent1">A new property is added to the
        Property list.</p>
    </li>

    <li>In the Name field, type a name that best describes the
    property.</li>

    <li>From the Type list, select the type of property that you
    want to create. There are numerous types of properties,
    including String, Float32, and Color.</li>

    <li>At the bottom of the Type list, you can also specify the
    container type for the property, if any. Select
    one of the following:

        <ul>
            <li><span class="NDLGUILabel">None</span> to specify
            that there will be only one property value.</li>

            <li><span class="NDLGUILabel">List</span> to specify
            that there will be a list of possible property
            values.</li>

            <li><span class="NDLGUILabel">Map</span> to specify
            that property values will be mapped to
            specific keys.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>In the Default Value field, specify the initial value
    that you want assigned to the property. Since there are
    numerous types of properties, the default value can be in the
    form of a numerical value, a filename, a string, a 3D
    coordinate in your world, and so on. (If a black Expand arrow is displayed to the left of the Default Value field, it means that additional editing tools exist for the current property values. Click the Expand arrow to display the additional editing tools.)</li>

    <li>Click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Expand</span> arrow
    beside the property name.

        <p class="indent1">Several new fields are displayed that
        allow you to control the management of the property.</p>
    </li>

    <li>From the Traits list, select any traits that you
    want associated with the property. The traits help to control
    the automated management of the properties, such as whether
    they are persisted, or can be accessed on a client.</li>

    <li>From the Restriction Type list, select the type of
    restriction you want to place on the property value.
    Depending on which option you select, additional input fields
    may be displayed. For example, if you select the "Range"
    option, two new fields are displayed where you can enter a
    minimum and maximum value for the range.</li>

    <li>In the Description field, enter additional information
    that further describes the property.</li>
</ol>

<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">To remove a property from an
entity model</p>

<ol>
    <li>Load an entity model into the Mix-in Editor. (You can also select a model in a diagram to load it into the Entity Model Editor.)

        <p class="indent1">A list of the model's properties and
        behaviors is displayed in the Entity Model Editor.</p>
    </li>

    <li>From the Property list, select the property that you want
    to remove. (Use Ctrl+click to select multiple properties.)</li>

    <li>Click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Remove</span> button
    or press the Delete key.</li>
</ol>

<p class="indent1">The property is removed from the list and is
no longer assigned to the entity model.</p>
