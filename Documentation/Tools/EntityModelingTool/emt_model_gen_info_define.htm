<h1>Defining a Model's General Information</h1>

<p>Every entity model has a set of information that helps to
define it at a general level. These properties include its name,
description, traits, and mix-ins. The Mix-ins field displays a list
of parent models whose properties will be mixed with those of the
current model. If you have more than one model in the Mix-ins
list, you can re-order the list to assign different priorities to
the parent models. The priority of each parent model will be used
in the event of a property name or behavior name conflict.</p>

<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">To define the general information
for a model</p>

<ol>
    <li>Load a model into the Mix-in Editor. (You can also select a model in a diagram to load it into the Entity Model Editor.)</li>

    <li>A list of properties and behaviors for the model is
    displayed in the Entity Model Editor. At the top of the
    Entity Model Editor are a series of fields that allow you to
    define the general information about the model.</li>

    <li>If the model still has its default name or needs to be
    renamed, enter a new, more descriptive name in the Name
    field.</li>

    <li>In the Description field, add information that helps to
    further describe the entity model.</li>

    <li>From the Traits list, select zero or more traits to define
    the specific characteristics of the model itself.</li>

    <li>To re-order the Mix-ins list, select a model from the
    list, and use the context menu to move the model up or
    down in the list. The order of the mix-ins determines their
    priority in the event that there is a property or behavior
    name conflict. (You can also drag each item up or down to reorder the items in the Mix-in list.)</li>
</ol>
