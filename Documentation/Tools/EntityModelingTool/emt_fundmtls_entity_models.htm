Entity Models
</h1>

<p>
Entity Models are the core items within your project. Each entity within your game is associated with an entity model in the Entity Modeling Tool. Entity models are used to define the set of properties, including their type and default value, as well as the behaviors that are to be associated with the entity in game. An in-game entity is an instance of an entity model.

            <div class="NDLNote">The Game Framework documentation has more detailed information
            about <a href="../../Programmer/Models/entity_models_intro.htm">Working with models</a>.

The following illustration demonstrates the relationship between an entity model in EMT and the entities within your game.

    </div> 

<p>
To take full advantage of EMT, entities can be broken down into different pieces using several entity models. Each model represents a different set of properties and behaviors that may be common to several different entities in your game. The properties and behaviors assigned to these different models are then &quot;mixed&quot; together to define the capabilities of each entity. For example, a flying dragon in your game may be represented by the following entity models.
</p>

    <div class="NDLFigureContainer">
        <img alt="Mixed entity model conceptual diagram" src="./images/Fundamentals_Models_online.png" width="428" height="448" />
        <p class="NDLFigureCaption">Mixed entity model conceptual diagram</p>
    </div> 

<p>
By breaking down an entity into different models, you can easily share common properties and behaviors between models allowing you to create a variety of content in a short period of time.
