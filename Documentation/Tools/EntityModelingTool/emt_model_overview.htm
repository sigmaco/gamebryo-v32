<h1>Entity Model Overview</h1>

<p>
When a designer decomposes their game world, they must identify which pieces or elements will be represented and at what level of detail. These elements are referred to as Entities. Since it would be unmanageable to create a unique implementation for each entity instance, these entities are further broken down into classes of objects called Models. Each class or model contains a set of functionalities that can then be linked or mixed together to realize the broad range of capabilities that must exist for the different entities within your game.
</p>

<p>
An entity model consists of a set of property types and each of these property types has a default value. It also is composed of a set of behaviors, which are scripts that access and modify those properties, as well as access the properties of other entities. Each model is thus like an object-oriented class, having encapsulation, interface, reusability, extensibility, and many other capabilities.
