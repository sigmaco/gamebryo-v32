<h1>Entity Modeling Traits</h1>

<p>
A set of predefined traits can be applied to entity models, properties, and behaviors to further
classify their functionality.  Traits are available in the Entity Model Editor and have tooltips
summarizing the information below.

<h4>Model Traits</h4>
<p>These are the traits available on entity models.</p>

                replicated entity are local only and will NOT be updated on other replicated
                copies of the entity or synchronized back to the original entity.  A Mutable
                property can be written to as normal when it is owned and such updates will
                replicate as normal which will over write any changes made to the mutable

<h4>Replication Property Traits</h4>
<p>In addition to the property traits above, when replication is being used you will need to set
    various replication group property traits.  These traits are used to assign properties into one
    or more replication groups. You can then use these groups to control area of interest or
    optimize bandwidth consumption. The names of these groups can be configured and the default
    names shown below are simply initial suggestions to get you started in creating a categorization
    policy. It is the final categorization policy that truly determines what these flags mean.</p>

                    which this entity is producing a replication group. This often means the
