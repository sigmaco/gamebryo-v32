<h1>EEDeploy Script File Format</h1>

<p>The deploy script file is written in XML using a specific
format that includes the following commands.</p>

<h3>eedeploy</h3>

<p>The top level command that defines the deploy script. All
other commands must be inside this command. This command supports
the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>version&mdash;<em>Required</em>. Version of deploy
    script. Must be 1.</li>
</ul>

<h3>conditional</h3>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">conditional</span> command
allows decisions to be made within a script file based on a value
of a variable. Variables can be defined elsewhere in the script
using the <span class="NDLSystemFont">define</span> command, or
they can be specified on the command line with either of the
following formats: <em>variableName=value</em> or
<em>variableName</em> (in which case a default value of "" is
inferred).</p>

<p>The body of the conditional is executed if the condition that
is specified by the attributes passes. Conditional blocks may be
arbitrarily nested. This command supports the following
attributes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>var&mdash;<em>Required</em>. Variable to test.</li>

    <li>op&mdash;<em>Required</em>. Comparison operation to
    perform. The valid values for op are:

        <ul>
            <li><b>==</b>&mdash;Passes if variable is equal to
            the value of the RHS attribute (right-hand
            side).</li>

            <li><b>!=</b>&mdash;Passes if variable is not equal
            to the value of the RHS attribute.</li>

            <li><b>defined</b>&mdash;Passes if variable is
            defined (specified on command line or via a
            <span class="NDLSystemFont">define</span> command
            with no subsequent <span class=
            "NDLSystemFont">undefine</span> tag).</li>

            <li><b>!defined</b>&mdash;Passes if variable is not
            defined (was not specified previously, or was removed
            by an <span class="NDLSystemFont">undefine</span>
            command).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>rhs&mdash;<em>Optional</em>. Provides the comparand used
    to determine if the conditional passed or failed. Note: This
    attribute is ignored for some operations, but if it is
    omitted for an operation that requires a RHS, then "" will be
    used instead.</li>
</ul>

<h3>copy</h3>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">copy</span> command is the
work horse of EEDeploy. It constructs a list of files from the
source (with optional inclusive/exclusive filters) and copies any
files that are newer than the same named file at the destination.
This command supports the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>src&mdash;The root of the path that will be searched for
    files to copy.</li>

    <li>dst&mdash;The root of the destination where files will be
    copied. If a file named <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">&lt;src&gt;\path\to\file.ext</span> passes
    the filters (pattern, exclude, and include), then it will be
    copied to <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">&lt;dst&gt;\path\to\file.ext</span>, where
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">&lt;src&gt;</span> and
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">&lt;dst&gt;</span> are the values
    of the src and dst attributes.</li>

    <li>pattern&mdash;<em>Optional</em>. Allows files to be
    included by file extension using a traditional Windows
    pattern string of the form *.ext. If not specified, the
    default of *.* will be used. For a more robust
    pattern-matching system, use the include attribute.</li>

    <li>exclude&mdash;<em>Optional</em>. A semicolon separated
    list of strings, none of which may be in the path. If this
    attribute is present, all potential files are vetted against
    the exclusion strings, If any match, the file will be
    rejected. To anchor a string to the end of the filename (for
    file extension filtering), append the $ character to the
    string. For example, "PS3;XBox360;.lua$" would exclude
    non-Windows content, and also exclude any files that end in
    .lua (but would not exclude a file named
    joe.luakas.KFM).</li>

    <li>include&mdash;<em>Optional</em>. A semicolon separated
    list of strings, one of which must be in the path. If this
    attribute is present, only one of the inclusion strings needs
    to be in the full file path, but if none are present, the
    file will not make the list. For example, "DX9;DX10" would
    match all files with DX9 or DX10 in their path, but does not
    require the path to have both DX9 and DX10. Like the exclude
    attribute, an include string can also be appended with $ to
    anchor it in searches to the end of file path.</li>
</ul>

<h3>copyfile</h3>

<p>Used to copy and optionally rename a single file. Unlike
<span class="NDLSystemFont">copy</span>, this command allows a
rename during the copy. This command supports the following
attributes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>src&mdash;<em>Required</em>. The source file name. This
    should be a file name and not a directory or path.</li>

    <li>dst&mdash;<em>Required</em>. The destination file name.
    This should be a file name and not a directory or path.</li>
</ul>

<h3>define</h3>

<p>Defines a variable (with an optional value). Variables can be
used to conditionally execute other parts of the script. See the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">conditional</span> command for more
information. This command supports the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>key&mdash;The variable name. If such a variable already
    exists, it will be redefined to the new value.</li>

    <li>value&mdash;<em>Optional</em>. The value of the variable.
    If this attribute is omitted, a default value of "" will be
    used instead.</li>
</ul>

<h3>delete</h3>

<p>Used to delete files. This command supports the same filtering
attributes as <span class="NDLSystemFont">copy</span> to
construct a file list. After files are deleted, any empty
directories left behind may be optionally deleted as well. This
command supports the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>src&mdash;The root of the path to search for files to
    delete.</li>

    <li>pattern&mdash;<em>Optional</em>. Allows files to be
    included by file extension using a traditional Windows
    pattern string of the form *.ext. If not specified, the
    default of *.* will be used. For a more robust
    pattern-matching system, use the include attribute.</li>

    <li>exclude&mdash;<em>Optional</em>. A semicolon separated
    list of strings, none of which may be in the path. If this
    attribute is present, all potential files are vetted against
    the exclusion strings, and if any match, then the file will
    be rejected. To anchor a string to the end of the filename
    (for file extension filtering), append the $ character to the
    string. For example, "PS3;XBox360;.lua$" would exclude
    non-Windows content, and also exclude any files that end in
    .lua (but would not exclude a file named
    joe.luakas.KFM).</li>

    <li>include&mdash;<em>Optional</em>. A semicolon separated
    list of strings, one of which must be in the path. If this
    attribute is present, only one of the inclusion strings needs
    to be in the full file path, but if none are present, the
    file will not make the list. For example, "DX9;DX10" would
    match all files with DX9 or DX10 in their path, but does not
    require the path to have both DX9 and DX10. Like the exclude
    attribute, an include string can also be appended with $ to
    anchor it in searches to the end of file path.</li>

    <li>remove_empty_dirs&mdash;<em>Optional</em>. Valid values
    are "true" and "false". If the value is true, then any
    subdirectories of src that are empty after the file deletes
    occur will be deleted. The search for empty directories is
    recursive, so src\emptydir1\emptydir2 will delete emptydir2,
    and then emptydir1, but the directory search does
    <em>not</em> take into account pattern, exclude, or include.
    It will remove any empty directories under src.</li>
</ul>

<h3>description</h3>

<p>Allows the author of the deploy script a free-form field to
type up a human readable description of the script. This command
does not influence the deployment behavior of EEDeploy in any
way, although it will be printed out if EEDeploy is run in
<a href="#verbose">verbose</a> mode.</p>

<h3>execute</h3>

<p>Allows the script to execute another command or executable on
a list of files. This command supports the same filtering
attributes as <span class="NDLSystemFont">copy</span> to
construct a file list. This command supports the following
attributes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>app&mdash;The application to execute on each file in the
    file list. System environment variables can be used for this
    attribute.</li>

    <li>args&mdash;The argument list for the executable. This can
    include free-form text (misc. command line options for the
    executable), as well as formatting markers to indicate where
    EEdeploy should insert the source filename and destination
    filename:

        <ul>
            <li>{0} - Source filename</li>

            <li>{1} - Destination filename</li>

            <li>{2} - Source root (the same value passed into the
            src attribute)</li>

            <li>{3} - Destination root (the same value passed
            into the dst attribute)</li>
        </ul>For example, app="7z" args="a -tzip {1}.zip {0}"
        would indicate that each file found in the source
        directory would go to it's own ZIP archive in the
        destination directory.
    </li>

    <li>create_dirs&mdash;<em>Optional</em>. Valid values are
    true or false. If true, then any directories in a destination
    filename that do not exist will be created before executing
    the external application. This can be useful if the external
    app does not support creating directories natively.</li>

    <li>src&mdash;The root of the path to search for files. This
    value is substituted for {2} in the arg attribute, and files
    that match the pattern, exclude, and includer filters will be
    individually substituted for {0}.</li>

    <li>dst&mdash;<em>Optional</em>. The root of the destination
    where files may be placed. This is only used if the arg
    attribute includes {1} or {3}. This value is substituted for
    {3} in the arg attribute, and if a file named <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">&lt;src&gt;\path\to\file.ext</span> passes
    the filters (pattern, exclude, and include), then it will be
    individually substituted for {1} as <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">&lt;dst&gt;\path\to\file.ext</span>, where
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">&lt;src&gt;</span> and
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">&lt;dst&gt;</span> are the values
    of the src and dst attributes.</li>

    <li>pattern&mdash;<em>Optional</em>. Allows files to be
    included by file extension using a traditional Windows
    pattern string of the form *.ext. If not specified, the
    default of *.* will be used. For a more robust
    pattern-matching system, use the include attribute.</li>

    <li>exclude&mdash;<em>Optional</em>. A semicolon separated
    list of strings, none of which may be in the path. If this
    attribute is present, all potential files are vetted against
    the exclusion strings, and if any match, then the file will
    be rejected. To anchor a string to the end of the filename
    (for file extension filtering), append the $ character to the
    string. For example, "PS3;XBox360;.lua$" would exclude
    non-Windows content, and also exclude any files that end in
    .lua (but would not exclude a file named
    joe.luakas.KFM).</li>

    <li>include&mdash;<em>Optional</em>. A semicolon separated
    list of strings, one of which must be in the path. If this
    attribute is present, only one of the inclusion strings needs
    to be in the full file path, but if none are present, the
    file will not make the list. For example, "DX9;DX10" would
    match all files with DX9 or DX10 in their path, but does not
    require the path to have both DX9 and DX10. Like the exclude
    attribute, an include string can also be appended with $ to
    anchor it in searches to the end of file path.</li>
</ul>

<h3>undefine</h3>

<p>Undefines a variable. Variables (or the lack of a variable)
can be used to conditionally execute other parts of the script.
See the <span class="NDLSystemFont">conditional</span> command
for more information. This command supports the following
attributes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>key&mdash;The variable name to undefine.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Here is a very simple example script file that simply copies
NIF, KFM, and KF files to the destination</p>

<pre>
&lt;eedeploy version="1"&gt;
&lt;copy src="Data" dst="DeployDir\Data" include=".NIF$;.KFM$;.KF$"/&gt;
&lt;/eedeploy&gt;
</pre>

<p>Here is a slightly more complicated script that optionally
excludes any debug visualization files from deployment when
creating the shipping build.</p>

<pre>
&lt;eedeploy version="1"&gt;

&lt;!-- Turn on verbose messages for the rest of the script. --&gt;
&lt;define key="verbose"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Exclude some files in shipping builds --&gt;
&lt;conditional var="config" op="==" rhs="shipping"&gt;
&lt;copy src="Data" dst="DeployDir\Data" exclude="DebugViz"/&gt;
&lt;/conditional&gt;

&lt;!--  Deploy all files in non-shipping builds --&gt;
&lt;conditional var="config" op="!=" rhs="shipping"&gt;
&lt;copy src="Data" dst="DeployDir\Data"/&gt;
&lt;/conditional&gt;

&lt;/eedeploy&gt;
</pre>

<p>The Mangled Metal Game Demo also makes use of a deploy script
located at <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">&lt;InstallPath&gt;\Samples\GameDemos\MangledMetal\MangledMetal.deployscript</span>
to deploy for the consoles.</p>

<p>It demonstrates the use of conditionals to perform platform
and configuration dependent processing, as well as how to invoke
EEDeploy from a project file.</p>

<p>For example, building MangledMetal for the PS3 in Release mode
executes:</p>

<pre>
EEDeploy MangledMetal.deployscript platform=PS3 config=Release
</pre>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
    <li>As a convention, deploy script files have the extension
    '.deployscript', although no code or logic depends on
    this.</li>
