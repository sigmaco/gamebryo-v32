<h1>Relationship between Entity Modeling Tool (EMT), World Builder, and the Game</h1>

<p>One fundamental concept to understand is the relationship that the World Builder has between 
the Entity Modeling Tool and the game application.</p>

<p>Recall that the Entity Modeling Tool is used to define 
<a href="../EntityModelingTool/emt_fundmtls_entity_models.htm">
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Models</span></a>
(and 
<a href="../EntityModelingTool/emt_fundmtls_presets.htm">
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Presets</span></a>)

which describe 
classes of game objects, their relationships, properties and behaviors. EMT can be used to 
directly affect a game by exporting out the models as <span class="NDLSystemFont">Flat</span> 
models. But even before exporting <span class="NDLSystemFont">Flat </span> models, EMT can affect 
World Builder. World Builder can be used to take <span class="NDLSystemFont">Models</span> 
(pre-exported) directly from EMT and instantiate them as 
<a href="../../Programmer/Entities/entity_intro.htm">
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Entity</span></a>
objects into the game world. From World Builder, the world can be exported as a game consumable 
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Xblock</span> file. When the game world is exported as an 
<span class="NDLSystemFont">Xblock</span> file, it affects the game directly which may even be 
used to alter the world of a live game simulation via Emergent&#8217;s rapid iteration 
technologies. Hence, one can picture the relationship between the Entity Modeling Tool, 
World Builder, and game application as in the following relationship diagram:</p>

</div>

<p>This division between World Builder and the game is made for a variety of
    reasons, but primarily, it is to guarantee that it is always possible to edit and
    create levels for your game. If the game and World Builder were intimately
    linked, it would tie the development of content to any delays of the programming
    team. One of the key tenets of World Builder's design is that the level design
    team can keep creating content even if the programming team is blocked.
</p>

<p>It should be noted that when placing entities in World Builder, only a very select subset of 
the game is present. Primarily, this is to assist in visualizing what the result will be in-game 
at the start of the game simulation.  No behaviors on any entity will be executed inside of 
World Builder. Additionally, no game-time built-in models will be allowed to be created in 
World Builder. Since no behaviors will be executed in World Builder, if one wishes to see how the 
behaviors will act, the ability to connect to a live game via rapid iteration should be taken
advantage of. Through the Toolbench Script Debugger, behaviors can even be debugged.
