<h1>Working with the Grid</h1>

<p>World Builder provides a grid that can be toggled on and off. The grid is a guide
    to give perspective on the distance, scale, and orientation of entities relative
    to each other.&nbsp;Through snap and precision setting options, the grid can additionally
    help facilitate aligning entities so that they fit seemlessly together.</p>

<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">Snap Settings</p>
    <p>Snap settings force specific increments in value settings when performing
        translation, rotation, and scale. Using snap settings effectively is important
        for ensuring entities fit together seemlessly. Each of the three operations
        (translation, rotation, and scale) has its own snap settings. Related to snap
        settings are precision settings. Precision settings are used to help translations and scales stay at even
        numbers always. In a way, precision is very similar to snap in that causes
        entities to move in set increments.&nbsp;The advantage of precision is that it does
        not operate on the translation or scale relative to the starting translation or
        scale, but rather makes its final value round off to an even increment.</p>

    <p>Translation snap can be enabled or disabled by the above-left icon. Additionally
        the snap values can be selected via the drop down combo box to the right of the
        icon. The values represent the distance between each translation increment when
        Translation Snap is enabled.</p>

    <p><img src="images/wb_world_grid_rotation_snap.jpg" /> <B>Rotation Snap</B></p>
    <p>Rotation snap can be enabled or disabled by the above left icon. Additionally,
        the snap values can be selected via the drop down combo box to the right of the
        icon. The values represent the degrees between each rotation increment when snap is enabled.</p>

    <p><img src="images/wb_world_grid_scale_snap.jpg" /> <B>Scale Snap</B></p>
    <p>&nbsp;Scale Snap can be enabled or disabled by the above left icon. Additionally,
        the snap values can be selected via the drop down combo box to the right of the
        icon. The value represents the distance between each scale increment when snap is enabled.</p>

<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">Precision Settings</p>
    <p>Translation and scale values can be automatically rounded to user-configurable increments.
        To enable, disable, or configure these operations, open the Settings dialog. Precision settings
        are in the Document.WorldBuilder.Precision category.</p>
    <p>When precision snapping is enabled, only the final translation and scale values (as appropriate)
        are rounded off; intermediate results are computed at full precision.</p>

<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">To change the appearance of the Grid</p>



<ol>
	<li>Open the Settings dialog by choosing Utilities &gt; Settings from the main menu.</li>
	<li>
      <!-- If you need to include an image, place it in the ./images subdir below your HTML file  -->
        From the Settings dialog, drill down into User.WorldBuilder.Grid settings. The
        following settings will be made available.<div class="FigureContainer">
            <img src="images/wb_world_grid_user_settings.jpg" />
                </div>
        </li>
        <li>From the these settings, the appearance of the grid can be modified. The &quot;Grid
            Extents&quot; specifies how far the grid will be seen from the origin of the world.
            The color of the grid lines can be controlled by the &quot;Grid Major Line Color&quot; and
            &quot;Grid Minor Line Color&quot; properties. Finally, the spacing can be controlled by
            the &quot;Major Line Spacing&quot; and &quot;Minor Line Spacing&quot; properties.</li>
