<h1>World Builder - Layer Editor</h1>

<p>You can use the World Builder Layer Editor to create, edit, delete, and manage layers. Layers are especially useful in multi-user editing environments
occurring in the same physical space.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Entities may only belong to a single layer.</li>

    <li>Layers can overlap and are completely arbitrary in their
    meaning.</li>

    <li>A layer must be viewed by opening the block file that contains it.</li>

    <li>The same layer file can be used by multiple block files,
    but this is not a recommended practice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the Layer Editor, the block file is considered a layer. All new entities will be spawned into the block file by default if no other layer is the current (active) layer.</p>

<h2>Layer Icons</h2>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Icon</th>

            <th>Details</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="images/layer_current.png"></td>

            <td>Represents the active layer where all new
            entities will be created in.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><img src="images/layer_writable.png"></td>

            <td>Represents layers that are writeable on the
            disk.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><img src="images/layer_readonly.png"></td>

            <td>Represents layers that are read-only on the
            disk.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Only one layer can be current and will receive all new
entities and new layers. On the right are three icons that
represent loaded, visible, and locked states. Layers can be
unloaded to reduce resources or clutter while editing. Each layer
can be made visible or hidden. If a layer is visible, but some of its
entities are hidden, then the icon will be gray. The locked icon
indicates whether or not the entities in that layer can be
selected and edited. Again, if the layer is not locked, but some
of its entities are, then it will be gray. Clicking on any of the
icons will toggle the state of the layers.</p>

<h2>Layer Commands</h2>

<p>Layers can have a number of commands/operations done on them.
These commands should be accessible by selecting the layers that
the operation should be done on in the Layers Panel and right
clicking and picking the operation from the right click menu.</p>

            reload the layer's contents. If the diskette is green, the
            layer is currently loaded and clicking the icon will unload it.
            If the diskette is red, the layer is currently unloaded and
            clicking the icon will load it.<br/>
            <br/>
            When a layer is unloaded, the entities it contains, as well as
            sub-layers and the entities <i>they</i> contain, are not available
            in World Builder, thus helping users work on large projects by
            lessening memory usage and visual clutter.<br/>
            <br/>
            This state is not part of the runtime state of the scene. However,
            please note that the export process <i>is</i> affected by this
            setting: An .xblock cannot be exported for a block or layer that
            is not fully loaded. When this happens, a message will appear
            in the Output view.<br/>

            will be shown. If some of the entities are not
            visible then the eye will be shown but grayed out. If
            the eye is not shown then the layer is hidden and no
            entities will be visible, even if individual entities
            are marked as visible. This state is not part of the
            runtime state of the scene.</td>

            is writable. If the pad lock is unlocked but grayed
            out then some of the entities in the layer are marked
            explicitly as frozen.<br>
            <br>
            The user may commonly set this option on layers that
            are not writable, but it is not on by default since
            the user may want to copy objects from those layers
            into another or view properties of entities in those
            layers.</td>
