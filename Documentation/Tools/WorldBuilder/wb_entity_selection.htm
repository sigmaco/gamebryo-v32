<h1>Selecting Entities</h1>
    <p>There are several ways to select an entity for manipulation in World Builder. </p>

    <h2>Viewport Click Selection</h2>
    <p>Users may select an entity at any time in the rendered viewport via left-mouse
        click. Left-clicking on any selected entity will de-select the entity. Clicking
        on any other entity will de-select the current selection and select the new
        entity instead. In order to append a selection to the list, press the &quot;Control&quot;
        key when selecting. De-selecting an entity with &quot;Control&quot; pressed will only
        de-select that particular entity and will not clear the rest of the selection.
        De-selecting without the &quot;Control&quot; key pressed will clear the selection.</p>

    <h2>Viewport Box Selection</h2>
    <p>Users may select multiple entities at once using the box selection mechanism.
        Pressing the &quot;Alt&quot; key while holding down the left mouse button will enable box
        selection. A 2D box will be drawn from the initial mouse click to the current
        mouse position. Releasing the button will cause all entities whose bounds
        intersect the box to be selected. </p>
	<p>Box selection has the following modifier keys:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Shift - If held, the selection becomes additive; the selection will merge with any other selected entities that were previously selected instead of clearing the selection.</li>
		<li>Ctrl - The selection toggles; if an entity within the box is not selected, it will be selected. Otherwise it will be deselected.</li>
		<li>Ctrl + Shift - The selection becomes subtractive; if an entity within the box is already selected, it will be deselected.</li>
	</ul>
	
    <table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
    <tr align="left">
        <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD"><p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>
            <div class="NDLNote">Note that the entity bounds are often larger than the entities themselves,
        occasionally causing the box selection to select entities that aren't visually
        within the box. When this occurs, use &quot;Control&quot; click to de-select the undesired
        entities.</div>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


    <h2>Entity Locking</h2>
    <p>When working with a large number of entities, it is often useful to prevent
        certain entities from being selected in the viewport. This is especially true
        for large objects like terrain or skydomes. There are two categories of entity
        locking control: per-entity or per-layer.</p>

    <h3>Per-Entity Locking</h3>
    <p>Users can adjust the selectability of a single entity by pressing the &quot;Lock Selected
        Entity&quot; button in the&nbsp; <a href="wb_ref_entity_editor.htm">Entity Editor</a>
        panel. If the entity has a graphical representation, it will no longer be selectable in
        the viewports, although it will be selectable through the
        <a href="wb_ref_entity_view.htm">Entity View</a> panel.</p>

    <h3>Per-Layer Locking</h3>
    <p>It is often valuable to only allow selection for a subset of the layers in the
        block. In the <a href="wb_ref_layer_editor.htm">Layer Editor</a>, it is possible to
        set the selectability of all entities in a given layer. This value takes precedence
        over any per-entity settings. </p>

    <h2>Selection Sets</h2>
    <p>If a user wishes to retain a selection for future use, named selection sets provide this functionality.
    Please see the description of the <a href="wb_ref_selection_set_editor.htm">selection
        set
        editor</a> for more details.</p>

    <h2>Entity View</h2>
    <p>The entity view provides several mechanisms for selecting entities. Simply
        selecting an entity in the view will select it in World Builder.
        &quot;Control&quot;-selection appends to the selection. &quot;Shift&quot; allows drag selection to
        occur as the mouse is dragged over the list. Note that this view is also useful
        for organizing entities by folder and by parent model, two common ways to assist
        in selection. Please see <a href="wb_ref_entity_view.htm">Entity View</a> for more information. </p>
