<h1>Synchronizing Content with the Game</h1>

<p>World Builder provides the ability to synchronize its content with the
content of the running game (flat and xblock content). From the World Builder's
point of view, this really amounts to nothing more than exporting to disk the
current state of the world. From that point on, the onus of hotloading the
changed content is on the application. The application is expected to have been
properly programmed and configured to use rapid iteration services. If properly
configured, the application will connect to the same Asset Controller that is
used by the Toolbench application. One example of a simple application that
uses rapid iteration services is the "HelloWorld" application.</p>

<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">To synchronize World Builder content with the
Game</p>

<ol>
    <li>Start up Toolbench. One of the first things that might be noticed is
    the <img src="images/wb_world_red_ac.jpg"> icon in the system tray. The
    fact that it is red indicates that it is not connected to any applications.
    </li>

    <li>After a few moments, the icon will change to green. This indicates that
    it has successfully connected to the Toolbench application.</li>

    <li>Open a solution that contains content for the game which will be
    rapidly iterated upon.</li>

    <li>Next, launch the game that has been configured to use rapid iteration
    and shares the content. If configured properly, the game should connect to
    the Asset Controller.</li>

    <li>Hover the mouse over the <img src="images/wb_world_green_ac.jpg"> icon.
    A tooltip resembling the following will be displayed:

        <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img src="images/wb_world_ac_tooltip.jpg"><br>
            <br>
            A very good indication that the application has been set up and
            configured properly is the "Connections" count. A value of "2" is
            good because it indicates one connection established for Toolbench
            and one connection established for the running game. If only 1
            connection is shown, this would indicate a configuration issue.
        </div>
    </li>

    <li>Now open the desired block file in the opened World Builder Game
    Solution.</li>

    <li>Make the desired edits to entities.</li>

    <li>When finished, select "Export Block" from the World Builder menu:

        <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img src="images/wb_world_export_world_menu.png">
        </div>
    </li>

    <li>If the application has been configured and programmed properly for
    rapid iteration, the changes will be pushed to the running game and should
    take effect immediately.</li>
</ol>
