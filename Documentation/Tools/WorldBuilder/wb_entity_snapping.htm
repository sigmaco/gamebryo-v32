<h1>Snapping Entities to the World</h1>

<p>When working with entities in the world, sometimes it is helpful to perform
transformations on them such that those transformations snap to discrete units.
The <a href="wb_ref_toolbars.htm#Snap_Toolbar">snap toolbar</a> contains the
various settings and tools for setting up the snap coordinates and snap
intervals to use when transforming entities.</p>

<table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
    <tr align="left">
        <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD">
            <p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Notes</p>

            <div class="NDLNote">
                When the various different transformation snap toggles are off,
                free placement mode is in effect. For example, if translation
                snap is turned off, entities may be translated without snapping
                to a designated interval.
            </div>

<h2>Snap Points</h2>

<p>Snap points are helpful tools to describe how entities should "snap"
together. Users define snap points in their DCC tool of choice (Max, Maya, XSI)
by creating a node named "SnapPoints" that is the child of the root node. Any
children of this node will be recognized by the snapping sub-system. These snap
points can be used when editing using the translation gizmo. When a single
entity is selected, its snap points should become visible as green crosses. As
the user drags the entity around the world, if any other snap points are in
range, they too will become visible. When two snap points are within the snap
tolerance of each other, the snap points will "snap" together. Note this will
not affect the orientation of the object, just its position. Users can break
the "snap" by either turning off snap points or by dragging the position
outside of the snap radius.</p>

<p>When defining snap points in your DCC tool, make sure that they are tagged
with <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiOptimizeKeep</span>. This will ensure the
snap points are properly saved from optimization settings at export time.</p>

            <div class="NDLNote">
                Users may adjust the distance at which snap points "stick" by
                adjusting the document setttings WorldBuilder.SnapPoints.Snap
                Point Stickiness Radius.
