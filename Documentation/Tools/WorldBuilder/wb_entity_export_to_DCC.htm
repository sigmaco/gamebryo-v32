<h1>Exporting Entities to DCC Tools</h1>

    <p>It is sometimes valuable to take the data that exists in World Builder and make 
        it available in DCC tools (Max, Maya, XSI). For example, a level designer may 
        rough out their environment in World Builder, but an environment artist will 
        need to finish it. For this situation, you can export data to FBX, which is 
        commonly read by most DCC tools.</p>
    <p>This tool can be accessed from the World Builder menu with the menu item "Export to Autodesk FBX". 
        This option may take some time depending on how many entities exist in your 
        scene and what options were chosen at export time.</p>
    
    <h2>Limitations of FBX export</h2>
    <p>The following data is exported to FBX:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Entity transforms as a top-level child of the scene root</li>
        <li>NiNode transforms in the scene graph</li>
        <li>Vertex positions and normals for unskinned geometry</li>
        <li>Entity visibility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any other data is explicitly not supported. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vertex UV coordinates and colors</li>
        <li>Packed or otherwise optimized vertex data</li>
        <li>Non-triangle based geometry</li>
        <li>Skinned or instanced meshes</li>
        <li>Lights, cameras, or other NiAVObject derivates</li>
        <li>Mesh shading or material information</li>
    </ul>
        
    
    <h2>Options Dialog</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Which Types of Entities to Export - Change these options to adjust the kinds of entities that will be exported.
            <ul>
            <li>Export Whitebox Geometry - These are entities that mix-in the "Whitebox" model.</li>
            <li>Export Meshes Marked With "IsStatic" True - These are entities that mix-in the "Mesh" model and have
            their "IsStatic" property set to true.</li>
            <li>Export Any Entity With An Associated Scene Graph - These are entities that have some kind of scene graph associated
            with the entity instance. This incorporates all "Mesh", "Whitebox", &quot;Terrain&quot;, "Actor" and other mix-ins. 
                All of the previously mentioned limitations apply to this exported content, so 
                it may not look 100% accurate.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Entity Filter Options
            - Change these options to adjust the filters applied when exporting entity 
            types.
            <ul>
                <li>Only Export Selected Entities - Only entities that are currently selected in the 
                    UI.</li>
                <li>Only Export Currently Visible Entities - Only entities that have visible layers 
                    and their tool-time visibility set to true. </li>
                <li>Only Export Entities From Active Layer And Child Layers - Only entities that 
                    exist on the active layer or its child layers.</li>
            </ul>        
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Tips for bringing content cleanly in and out of FBX</h2>
    <p>There are many options in the DCC tools when importing FBX files. Each importer is different, but the following options
    should be preserved:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not adjust the units.</li>
        <li>Preserve the up-axis set in the FBX file. For Maya, this means that you need to set Maya to Z-up before importing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you follow the above guidelines, when you export the adjusted geometry back to NIF, it will come in at the same scale
    as when the data was exported.</p>
