<h1>Working with Asset Controller</h1>

<p>Working with World Builder (and game solutions in general)
requires a running Asset Controller process in order to operate
properly. This requirement exists to facilitate functionality
needed by the "Asset" type property seen in both the World
Builder and Entity Modeling Tool. When a game solution is opened,
the Asset Controller will be commanded to configure itself such
that it monitors the asset web corresponding to the currently
opened solution. Value assignments for any "Asset" property types
are validated using the Asset Controller. Finally, the Asset
Controller is used for supporting rapid iteration in World
Builder. For example, if a scenegraph changes on disk, it will be
automatically reloaded and re-rendered in the World Builder view
ports.</p>

<p>When first installed, Toolbench will have been configured such
that it launches the Asset Controller process automatically upon
starting the game solution plug-in and will kill the process when
closing. The actual connection between the tool and the Asset
Controller is also automatic.</p>

<p>The default Asset Controller port connection is "13215",
however, if a reason is found for requiring a different port
configuration, the default port can be modified using the
Connections view. Also, occasionally developers find it useful
to have the Asset Controller continue to run even after Toolbench
shuts down. Toolbench can be configured such that it does not
start or stop the Asset Controller process. The steps for
performing these configurations are found below. </p>

<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">To change the default port of the
Asset Controller</p>

<ol>
    <li>Ensure that the Connections view is visible. If it is
    not visible, toggle it using the <span class="NDLGUILabel">View</span> menu.

        <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img src="images/wb_world_view_connections_menu.png">
        </div>
    </li>

    <li>Switch to the Connections view and find the Emergent Asset Controller connection. It should resemble the following:<br>

        <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img src="images/wb_world_ac_connection.png">
        </div>
    </li>

    <li>Right-click the Emergent Asset Controller connection and choose <span class="NDLGUILabel">Remove Connection</span>.

        <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img src="images/wb_world_remove_connection.png">
        </div>
    </li>

    <li>Next, choose <span class="NDLGUILabel">Add Connection</span>. When the Add Connection dialog appears, ensure that the new connection is named Emergent Asset Controller and set the desired port value. In the screen shot below, the port setting has been changed to 13220.

        <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img src="images/wb_world_new_connection.png">
        </div>
			
			<p class="indent1">When finished, click <span class="NDLGUILabel">OK</span>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>For changes to take effect, shutdown and restart Toolbench. Note that if the connection named Emergent Asset Controller should ever be removed
    without specifying a new connection of the same name, then
    Toolbench will automatically create a default Emergent Asset
    Controller connection.</li>
</ol>

<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">To change the Toolbench Asset
Controller launch settings</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open the Settings dialog by selecting <span class="NDLGUILabel">Utilities > Settings</span>.</li>

    <li>In the User tab of the Settings dialog, click <span class="NDLGUILabel">Game Solution</span>.</li>

    <li>In the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Start/Stop Asset Controller</span> field, select either True or False to change the game solution behavior such that the Asset Controller process will not be started / stopped by the tool. The effect will take place the next time Toolbench is started.</li>

    <li>To change the actual executable that is launched when the
    Start/Stop Asset Controller value is true, simply specify
    the full path in the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Asset Controller Executable</span> field. If environmental variables are specified in the path, they will be expanded. Note that it should be rare ever needing to change the Asset Controller executable that is launched.</li>
