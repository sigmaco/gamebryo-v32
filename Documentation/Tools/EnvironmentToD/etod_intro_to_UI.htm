  <p>
    The Time Of Day Editor window is a floating window that is not visible by default.
    To display it, select the view menu and click on the Time Of Day Editor option (Fig.2).
  </p>
  <div class="FigureContainer">
    <img alt="Displaying the Time Of Day Editor" src="images/todfrommenu.jpg" />
    <p class="FigureCaption">
      Fig.2 : Displaying the Time Of Day Editor</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    The Time Of Day Editor panel is separated in three different sections. The left
    section of the panel will always display a summary of the current values at a given
    time for all the properties that can be animated. The top right section adjusts
    time and correspondingly animation over a span of time. The text box and the slider
    allow the user to control the current time displayed. The animation is turned on
    or off and its speed is controlled here as well. It is important to note that the
    time of day animation within Toolbench is for aiding in design purposes only and
    is not in fact related to the main animation settings. This means that time of day
    affected objects will only have their properties animated if the time of day animation
    is playing. Finally, the bottom right section is used for editing individual property
    values at selected times through graphs and/or keyframes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, the time of day editor only supports animation of float and color properties.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Editing Time Of Day Properties
  </h2>
  <p>
    Clicking the add keyframe button (<img src="images/addkeyframebtn.jpg" />) for any
    environment property listed will add a new keyframe at the current time and value
    shown. Also, there are two ways to edit an individual environment property
    in more detail using the Time of Day Editor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Graphically, you can edit properties using the graph displayed underneath each property
    name. Left-clicking on the graph adds a keyframe at that position. Individual points
    on the graphs can be dragged around inside the graph to change their positions.
    Right-clicking on a graph point allows a user to remove it from the graph. In the
    case of a color property, clicking on the rectangle thumb block will open an instance
    of color picker and allow the color to be adjusted. Note, the start and end keyframes
    cannot be deleted or dragged horizontally to different times, but they can be adjusted
    vertically to change their values.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, checking the "Show Keyframes" box will display a textual representation of
    the current keyframes beneath the graph for further editing. Keyframes listed here
    can be changed by typing appropriate values into the time or value text boxes on
    the far left and right respectively, or by adjusting the slider thumbs in the middle.
    To the right of each keyframe, a button exists to remove the keyframe entirely (
    <img src="images/removekeyframe.jpg" />).
    Again, the first and last keyframes can not be deleted and their times cannot be
    changed, but their values can be adjusted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Detailed information for each property is provided by the tooltip (Fig.3). This
    will give a property's description, which is the same as the description provided
    in the associated entity model, as well as the property's range which defines the
    bounds between which a value can be modified.
  </p>

  <p>
    All properties added to the editor have a defined range of valid values. Initially
    those are set using the model property's range restriction, if it exists. If it
    does not, default values will be used. The range can also be edited. When available,
    right-clicking on the property's header will bring up a context menu. Select the
    'Set Constraints...' option to open a window (Fig.4) where you can define a new
    constraint range. Setting a new range smaller than the previous one will cause existing
    keyframes outside this range to snap to the new constraints.<br>

    <img alt="Set constraint window" src="images/setconstraint.jpg" />

  <p>
    In the current implementation, setting constraint is only available for float properties.
