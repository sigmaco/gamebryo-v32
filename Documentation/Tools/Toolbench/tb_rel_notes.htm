<a name="Added_Features_and_Fixed_Bugs" id="Added_Features_and_Fixed_Bugs"></a><h2>Added Features, Changed Behavior, and Fixed Bugs</h2>


<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.2</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Toolbench UI has been overhauled, including usability and performance enhancements.</li>
<li>Toolbench now hosts a new tool, the <a href="../SimDebugger/sim_debugger_intro.htm">Simulation Debugger</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="../EntityModelingTool/emt_ref_find_in_files.htm">Find in Files</a> feature is available and particularly useful for searching behavior scripts.</li>
<li>The Output View toolbar now displays a count of messages logged for each channel. Additional channels are available via a droplist in the toolbar.</li>
<li>Toolbench now supports <a href="../WorldBuilderTerrain/wbt_artist_guide.htm">creating and editing terrain</a>.</li>
<li>Toolbench now supports <a href="../EnvironmentToD/etod_intro.htm">Environments and TimeOfDay animations</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed a possible crash when cancelling prompts to overwrite files in response to Toolbench revision control edit requests.</li>
<li>The undo/redo stack can be cleared via the Edit menu. This can occasionally be useful when making memory-intensive edits.</li>
<li>Game solution revision control settings have been reorganized for better visibility.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare problem with connecting to the Asset Controller on Toolbench startup.</li>
<li>Toolbench is now Large Address Aware, allowing it to utilize up to 4GB of virtual address space. This is implemented via a Toolbench post build step.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug with tab-switching that could cause progressive slowdown in Toolbench.</li>
    <li>We now include a ToolbenchFBX.sln solution that contains the plug-in used to export selected objects in the scene to FBX.  This solution also contains a reference to the NiFBXConverter project.  If you are binary customer this project will not be found because we don't ship source for it.  You'll want to exclude this project from the solution should you find yourself needing to rebuild ToolbenchFBX.sln.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The BgAvatar model found in BaseGame had its internal model-id changed. All references 
        in LightSpeed have been updated so this should not affect clients. 
        However, if you referenced the BgAvatar model in your own projects or tests, then those references will need 
        to be updated. The id for BgAvatar has been changed from
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">c0278efa-9b91-4b82-9d4b-2e6d777b3aa6</span> to
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">ee788bdb-3207-584c-9983-1310a9f5665d</span>. 
        References (if any exist) will need to be changed manually in 
        <span class="NDLSystemFont">.model, .preset, block, .diagram, .layer</span> files 
        where they occur.
    </li>
    <li>AssetController&#39;s logical asset ID generation algorithm has changed. Where as 
        previously, logical asset IDs were generated using the case sensitive relative 
        path of the file, logical asset IDs now are generated in a case insensitive 
        manner. The change was made to make the system less prone to error. This change 
        in policy affects all model, preset, and block files that have asset property 
        references. To update existing references, a
        <a href="../../Tools/Toolbench/tb_convertllidrefs.htm">tool</a>
         for converting and updating 
        the logical asset references is available.</li>
    <li>Debug and Release builds of AssetController and certain 
	shader parsers and libraries were not previously installed. This
	would prevent Debug and Release builds of Toolbench from working
	correctly. Those components are now shipping, so Debug and Release
	builds of Toolbench should now run as expected.</li>
    <li>Fixes have been applied to improve support of persistent asset IDs.</li>
    <li>The GSLIB library definition file format has been updated. All dependencies 
        must now have a library-version definition. All shipping GSLIB files have been 
        updated.</li>
    <li>Shortcuts and Settings are now available from the new Utilities menu.
        The <a href="tb_ref_settings_editor.htm">Settings Editor</a> has been rewritten and now includes tabs for all open documents with settings.</li>
    <li>A new <a href="tb_game_soln_content_import.htm">Integration Wizard</a> is available from the Utilities menu. This will launch the same 
        integrations page as the Game Solution creation wizard. This page has been 
        updated to allow users to re-import existing libraries as well as import new 
        libraries.</li>
    <li>The Game Solution file format has undergone a version change. This change will 
        launch additional tools to update the asset web to a new version as well as 
        launch the integration wizard to update Standard Model Library.</li>
    <li>The formats of many Toolbench file types have changed to improve mergeability. This includes <span class="NDLSystemFont">.model, .preset, .block, .layer</span> files.
        Migration steps will update new files when they are opened.</li>
    <li>The use of XMLSerializer has been removed from the Toolbench codebase. This also resulted in migration steps for file formats.
        Note that any custom types added by users via Toolbench plug-ins may need manual review to migrate correctly.</li>
    <li>New settings exist for launching scripts with an external editor.</li>
    <li>Changes made to a behavior in an external editor will now be picked up
        by Toolbench, which will offer the opportunity to reload the file.</li>
    <li>User settings have been added to specify the paths for Asset Viewer and Animation Tool.
        Currently these settings are used while launching either tool when the new "View Asset" feature
        is selected from a model's context menu in the EMT Project Explorer or WB Palette.</li>
    <li>The Game menu, for pausing and resetting the connected game, is now globally available, not just when World Builder is active.</li>
    <li>The Output View now has an explicit auto-scroll toggle to control whether new messages are kept in view.</li>
    <li>Output View text is now auto-sized to the columns.</li>
    <li>Connection events are noted in the Output View and connected applications are listed in a Connections view tooltip.</li>
    <li>Toolbench now defaults to a maximized window on the first run.</li>
    <li>Asset Controller indicates when it is busy crawling assets with a busy icon.</li>
    <li>A new pluggable context menu system has been added. It uses the DynamicContextMenuProvider extension point.</li>
    <li>Hookable events have been added to the migration system.</li>
    <li>The same content can no longer be added to a game solution multiple times.</li>
    <li>Actions in the Game Solution view are now recorded on the proper content for purposes of undo.</li>
    <li>Some critical error reporting has been changed to use message boxes, rather than just the Output View.</li>
    <li>The File Associations editor has been removed as this functionality is effectively handled by the installer.</li>
    <li>Explicit garbage collection is now performed on save operations.</li>
    <li>TextDocument is now more viable as a base class for customer extension.</li>
    <li>Fixed a possible crash closing the color picker.</li>
    <li>Toolbench has new command line arguments for suppressing Asset Controller and ignoring user settings, useful for test execution.</li>
    <li>File types that require a game solution (.block and .emtproj) will no longer be added to the Most Recently Used menu.</li>
    <li>Side-by-side files for storing PerUserPerContent settings are now stored in .usersettings files to help exclude them from revision control.
        These files will be seeded with the contents of any legacy .settings files.</li>
    <li>Improved and standardized tooltips for properties and behaviors in all editors.</li>
    <li>In the Game Solution view, EMT project references now use a distinct icon and cannot be dragged and dropped.</li>
    <li>Toolbench now properly supports swapping the function of left and right mouse buttons in Control Panel.</li>
    <li>Mixing data from a different asset-web than the application is expecting during rapid iteration will lead to 
    application or tool errors.</li>
    <li>The Toolbench console mode does not allow access to the scene graph or entity manager.</li>
</ul>
	
<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Toolbench is a new tool. See the <a href=
    "tb_intro.htm">Toolbench documentation</a> for more
    information.</li>
</ul><a name="Known_Issues_and_Limitations" id=
"Known_Issues_and_Limitations"></a>

<h2>Known Issues and Limitations</h2>

<h3>All Gamebryo LightSpeed Releases</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Only the Shipping build configuration of Toolbench is installed pre-built and ready to run.
If you build Toolbench in Debug or Release configuration, be sure that AssetController.exe, DirectoryTagger.ini, LogicalIdTagger.ini, and MimeTagger.ini are present
in the same folder as ToolbenchWindowed.exe. These files are normally copied as a build step in Foundation.sln.
For a binary installation, you will need to copy the files from the Toolbench Shipping configuration in %EMERGENT_PATH%\SDK\Win32\Bin\VC90\Shipping.<!-- DT32794 --></li>

    <li>Running <a href=
    "../../Tools/Toolbench/tb_ui_command_line.htm">Toolbench
    Command-line</a> via the <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">ToolbenchConsole.exe</span> application will
    cause adverse side affects to the normal windowed Toolbench
    if it is running. The issue is that both applications share
    the AssetController and the settings for one may not be
    correct for the other. Do not run these applications
    simultaneously.</li>

    <li>Visual Studio C# projects for Toolbench may not load
    properly in the IDE if the path to your LightSpeed
    installation is too deep. The reason for this is that Visual
    Studio constructs the output location for C# projects by
    taking the absolute path to the project file and appending
    the relative output path specified in the settings. This can
    result in very long paths that can exceed the character limit
    for a path. To work around this issue, you may need to
    install LightSpeed closer to the root of the file
    system.</li>

    <li>Sometimes Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) can
    render incorrectly due to driver interaction problems. It is
    highly recommended that users upgrade their drivers to the
    most recent version to avoid seeing these glitches. Click
    <a href="./images/wpf_glitch.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>
    for an example of what the glitching looks like. If it does
    happen just resize the window, and that should fix it in most
    cases.</li>

    <li>Windows may appear to flicker when changing between views
    in Toolbench under Windows Vista. The setting "Disable Aero"
    (in the "[User] Toolbench" category) turns off Aero desktop
    composition while running Toolbench, which can mitigate this
    issue.</li>

    <li>Due to an issue with Windows Presentation Foundation
    (WPF), Toolbench may throw an exception on exit if the debug
    version of the D3D runtime is used and "Break on Memory
    Leaks" is enabled. This could occur in both a shipping
    version of Toolbench as well as a debug version of
    Toolbench.</li>

    <li>Due to an issue with Windows Presentation Foundation
    (WPF), Toolbench may throw an exception on startup if the
    debug version of D3D runtime is used and "Break on Error" is
    enabled. This could occur in both a shipping version of
    Toolbench as well as a debug version of Toolbench.</li>

    <li>The Game Solution Wizard will produce error messages when
    creating a game solution in a directory that contains an
    imported library (for example, when creating a game solution
    in %EMERGENT_PATH%\Media which contains
    StandardModelLibrary). This is because it is trying to copy
    the imported libraries from that path on top of themselves,
    and the imported library is read-only which prevents
    this.</li>

    <li>If a game uses the Rapid Iteration service
    (egf::RapidIterationService) and attempts to read from a
    different asset web root than the Asset Controller is
    servicing, then all asset requests will fail once the
    connection to Asset Controller is made. This can be be a
    problem if a Game Solution is opened in Toolbench, and a game
    is subsequently run that points to a different asset web
    root, as Toolbench will modify the asset web root serviced by
    Asset Controller to the asset web root indicated by the
    GSL.</li>
