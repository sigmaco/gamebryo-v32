<h1>Toolbench Plug-in Architecture</h1>

<p>
    Below is an overview of the Toolbench plug-in architecture along with a 
    description of the core concepts one must be familiar with in order to 
    understand how the tool was designed and should be used. The goal of this 
    section is not to explain how to write plug-ins. For more information on plug-in 
    development refer to the
    <a href="../../Programmer/Toolbench/efr_toolbench_createplugin.htm">Toolbench 
    programmer&#39;s guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Toolbench Kernel</h2>

<p>
    Toolbench, by design, does not provide a lot of functionality out of the box. The 
    core of Toolbench (the Toolbench kernel) upon which all plug-ins are written, 
    consists of various interfaces and low level helper classes useful to all 
    plug-ins. The primary role of the Toolbench kernel is to manage the loading of 
    plug-ins, the methods by which plug-ins communicate with one another, and the 
    dependencies between plug-ins.</p>
    <p>
        When an application is written using the Toolbench architecture, the entry point 
        for said application is actually a plug-in as well. When the Toolbench kernel is 
        loaded, it scans the plug-in registry for any &quot;runnable&quot; plug-ins. A runnable 
        plug-in contains specialized code and serves as an application's entry point. 
        The Workbench plug-in is an example of a runnable plug-in since it provides the 
        core user interface (UI) entry point for any Toolbench application requiring UI 
        elements.</p>
    <p>
        It is important to note that runnable plug-ins may also be completely command 
        line driven. For example, if one were to create a asset build plug-in meant to 
        run from the command line one could do so while still leveraging the additional 
        plug-ins used to process assets in the UI version of the tool.</p>

<h3>Plug-in manifest</h3>
    <p>The plug-in manifest is simply an XML file with an associated schema. The 
        manifest contains important information and is used as the basis for delayed 
        loading of Toolbench plug-ins. When the Toolbench kernel is loaded, it 
        determines what plug-ins are available but scanning a plug-ins folder for any 
        available plug-in manifest files. However, Toolbench only loads the plug-ins that are 
        necessary based on what the user is currently working on. For example, when 
        Toolbench first loads very few plug-ins have actually been loaded and 
        initialized. This allows 
        a large federation of plug-ins in addition to facilitating fast start up 
        times for the user. </p>
    <p>As the user begins working on various pieces of game content, additional plug-ins 
        are loaded on demand as needed. Additional information may be found in the 
        programmer's guide for the
        <a href="../../Programmer/Toolbench/efr_manifest_plugin.htm">plug-in manifest</a>.</p>
    
<h3>Extension points</h3>
    <p>Extension points are used by plug-ins to define functionality extendable by other 
        plug-ins. Extension points are identified by a unique name (usually the fully 
        qualified path of the plug-in plus the extension point name) and an associated 
        schema. The schema is used by the extension point to define the expected 
        interface and data required by plug-ins who choose to attach new functionality 
        to the extension point.</p>
    <p>The Toolbench kernel manages a repository of extension points such that a given 
        plug-in may query for all plug-ins implementing a given extension point. For 
        additional information on extension points refer to the programmer's guide for
        <a href="../../Programmer/Toolbench/efr_manifest_plugin_extensionpoint.htm">
        extension points</a>.</p>

<h3>Extensions</h3>
    <p>Extensions are the means by which plug-ins contribute functionality to Toolbench. 
        As stated above, everything in Toolbench is a plug-in. Plug-ins must provide 
        extension points for other plug-ins to hook into via extensions. The extension 
        and extension point system is designed to provide absolute flexibility for 
        plug-ins to define whatever information is necessary for one plug-in to talk to 
        another. For additional information on plug-in extensions refer to the 
        programmer's guide for
        <a href="../../Programmer/Toolbench/efr_manifest_plugin_extension.htm">
        extensions</a>.</p>

<h2>Workbench Plug-in</h2><a name="Workbench"></a>
    <p>
        The Workbench plug-in provides the primary entry points for other plug-ins 
        wishing to add UI elements to Toolbench. UI elements include toolbars, menus, views, 
        icons, and any other constructs necessary for user interaction.</p>
    <p>
        Workbench groups UI elements into various 
        <a href="tb_fundmtls_ui_main.htm">perspectives</a> which target a given task 
        at hand. The easiest perspective paradigm to understand is the document 
        perspective. The Workbench UI is dynamically generated based on several factors, 
        one of which is the document perspective. The document perspective refers to the 
        currently active document where different documents may require different UI 
        elements to be present. This design allows for a cleaner UI since only the 
        applicable UI elements are present for a given document. For example, when using 
        the <a href="../EntityModelingTool/emt_intro.htm">Entity Modeling Tool</a>, 
        certain UI elements like toolbars and menus contain commands that are 
        meaningless when working in <a href="../WorldBuilder/wb_intro.htm">World Builder</a>. 
        For more information on the Workbench plug-in, refer to the
        <a href="tb_fundmtls_ui_main.htm">Toolbench UI overview</a>. The
        <a href="../../Programmer/Toolbench/efr_toolbench_workbench.htm">Workbench 
        documentation</a> under the programmer's guide section provides a more in depth 
        view in terms of how the system is actually implemented.
        Below is a high level overview showing how the Toolbench kernel, Workbench 
        plug-in, and user contributed plug-ins relate to each other.</p>
