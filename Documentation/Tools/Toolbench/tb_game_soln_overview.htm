<h1>Game Solution Overview</h1>

<p>
A game solution is a virtual container that holds all of the content that you will be working on for your game. By keeping all your game content within a single container, you can more easily manage, build, and maintain it. Game solutions can be shared across a team or each person working on a game can create their own game solution and populate it with the content that meets their personal needs.
</p>

<p>
Game solutions can include entity modeling projects, World Builder block documents, and other types of content in support of partner integrations.
</p>

    <div class="NDLFigureContainer">
        <img alt="Items within a game solution" src="./images/Game_Solution_Online.png"/>
        <p class="NDLFigureCaption">Items within a game solution</p>
    </div> 

<p>
Game solutions are displayed in the Game Solution view. This view serves as a portal to the major sub-tools in Toolbench. Double-clicking Game Solution items will open the selected content in the associated tool. You can access specific commands by right-clicking any of the items in the view.
</p>

  <table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
      <tr align="left">
          <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD"><p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>
              <div class="NDLNote">Only one game solution can be displayed in the Game Solution view at a time.
              </div>
          </td>
      </tr>
  </table>

<p>
The Game Solution view is also used to establish dependencies between top-level content items. Once an EMT project or block file is loaded, it can be expanded in the Game Solution view
to show a References folder. References to other content in the asset web can then be added or removed. It is strongly recommended that any referenced content also be added to the game solution for easy access.
