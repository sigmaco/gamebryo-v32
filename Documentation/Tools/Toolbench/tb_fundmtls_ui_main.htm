<h1>Exploring the Toolbench Interface</h1>

<p>The Toolbench user interface (UI) is provided by the <a href=
"tb_fundmtls_plugin_architecture.htm">Workbench plug-in</a>. The Workbench
plug-in exists mostly as a container for views, documents, toolbars and menus.
When launching a UI-based Toolbench application, the Workbench plug-in and any necessary core plug-ins that are required by Workbench are loaded. The
following screenshot shows a bare bones Toolbench application.</p>

<div class="NDLFigureContainer">

    <p class="NDLFigureCaption">Toolbench UI overview</p>
</div>

<p>All menus and toolbars in the Workbench are generated automatically based on
the active context defined by what perspectives are active at a given time (see
below). In the screenshot above, the only menus and toolbars available are the
ones provided by the Workbench plug-in itself.</p>

<a name="Perspectives" id="Perspectives"></a><h2>Perspectives</h2>

<p>The Workbench UI contains one or more <em>perspectives</em>. A Perspective defines a
grouping of views, menus, and toolbars. Perspectives are a means of isolating
the UI elements required to accomplish a specific goal. This differs from
traditional UI applications which try to fit everything into the window even if
the user would never interact with them. For example, when working in the
<a href="../EntityModelingTool/emt_intro.htm">Entity Modeling Tool,</a> one
does not care about placing entities in the world so the UI for doing so is not
present. The following list contains the specific types of perspectives
supported by the Workbench infrastructure.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Global perspective
    
        <p class="indent1">Plug-ins containing views, menu items, toolbars and
        other UI elements mapped to the global perspective are loaded
        immediately after Workbench has initialized. For example, the output
        view in the lower region of the screen shot above is defined in an
        output view plug-in which is has been automatically loaded. The output
        view plug-in causes the logger plug-in to be loaded in order to capture
        log messages as soon as the application has been created.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Live Content perspective
    
        <p class="indent1">The Live Content perspective is used for mapping the
        functionality required for content considered to be in the global
        context. In the screen shot above, the Game Solution view is
        displayed on the left hand side.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Active Content perspective

        <p class="indent1">The Active Content perspective is used to display
        context sensitive UI based on the document currently opened and being
        worked on. Note, this document/content is <b>in addition</b> to the
        Live Content discussed above. This following screen shot comes from an
        <a href="../EntityModelingTool/emt_intro.htm">Entity Modeling Tool</a>
        project. Note the additional views, menus, and toolbar items present
        due to the fact we have an EMT project file opened. The Game
        Solution view is also visible because the Game Solution content has
        been mapped to the Live Content perspective.</p>
