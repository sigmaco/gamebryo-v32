  <h1>
    Editing and Using Multiple Sectors
  </h1>
  <p>
    Toolbench supports multi-sector terrain editing, allowing large worlds to be build
    within the editor. Most of the multi-sector terrain controls are located within
    the right-click context menu of the viewport when using the Terrain edit gizmo.
    The following sections describe how to use each of the options available.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Creating Sectors
  </h2>
  <p>
    Create a new sector by right-clicking at the position where a new sector is to be
    located, which will open a menu. From this menu, scroll down to the Sector(X, Y)
    option and a new menu will appear to the right with the option 'Create'. Click 'Create'
    to create a new, blank sector at this position. Sectors will be saved automatically
    in the directory the root.terrain file is saved in, with the name being Sector_X_Y.dof
    where X and Y are the (X,Y) positions of the sector on the terrain .
  </p>
  <h2>
    Loading Sectors
  </h2>
  <p>
    Loading a sector will use sector data saved to disk to add a sector to the terrain
    at the selected position. In order to load a sector, there must be an appropriately
    named file saved to disk for that position, or the load option will not appear for
    that sector. To load a sector, right-click at the position to load the sector and
    scroll to down to the Sector(Position X, Position Y) option and a new menu will
    appear to the right. In this menu, select the option 'Load'. This will cause the
    sector information as saved to disk for that location to become visible on the terrain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: Only Sector(0,0) will be loaded by default. In order to load additional sectors
    upon opening a terrain, the available sectors must be added to the set of initial
    sectors in Terrain properties. For further details, see the 
    <a href="#Configuring_initially_loaded_sectors">Configuring Initially Loaded Sectors</a> 
    section.
  </p>
  <a name="Unloading_Sectors" id="Unloading_Sectors" ></a>
  <h2>
    Unloading Sectors
  </h2>
  <p>
    Unloading a sector will remove it from being visible on the current terrain. However,
    the sector itself will still exist on the disk and any changes to the sector will
    be saved. To unload a sector, right-click on any loaded sector and scroll to down
    to the Sector(Position X, Position Y) option and a new menu will appear to the right.
    In this menu, select the option 'Unload'. This will produce a window with the warning
    message 'Unloading this sector will cause any changes you have made to the sector
    to be saved to disk. Are you sure you wish to continue?'. Click 'Yes' to unload
    the sector and save the sector data, or 'No' to cancel the operation.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Deleting Sectors
  </h2>
  <p>
    To delete a sector, right-click on any loaded sector and scroll to down to the Sector(Position
    X, Position Y) option and a new menu will appear to the right. In this menu, select
    the option 'Delete'. A window will then appear with the warning message 'Deleting
    this sector will also delete it's data on disk. Are you sure you wish to continue?'.
    Click 'Yes' to delete the sector from the terrain and the sector data from the disk,
    or 'No' to cancel the operation. This operation is undoable.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Painting Across Multiple Sectors
  </h2>
  <p>
    Painting across multiple sectors works just like painting across a single sector
    for all painting operations. However, since sectors can be loaded and unloaded at
    any time during editing a terrain, undesirable lines or holes in the terrain may
    occur. In order to avoid these situations, be sure when painting along the edge
    of a sector that is adjacent to another sector, that all sectors at a seam or corner
    are currently loaded. Alternatively, these situations can also be fixed with additional
    painting on the terrain. In particular, the undo system may operate in an unexpected
    fashion if the border of two sectors contains inconsistent data as the terrain painting
    will always attempt to make the data across sectors consistent.

  <h2>
    Configuring the Initially Loaded Sectors
  </h2>
  <p>
    Sector(0,0) is initially loaded by default. In order to load additional sectors
    upon opening a terrain, the available sectors must be added to the set of initial
    sectors in Terrain properties. Only sectors which already exist on disk may be loaded
    in this manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to change which sectors are initially loaded, right-click on the terrain
    object and from the menu which will open and select 'Terrain properties'. Then a
    'Terrain Properties' window will open with multiple tabs. Click on the 'Storage'
    tab at the top and locate the section labelled 'Initialization Settings:'. On the
    right-hand side this section displays 'Initial Sectors:', or the list of sectors
    on the terrain which are set to load initially. By default this list only includes
    Sector(0,0). The left-hand side section displays the list of 'Available Sectors',
    or sectors for which information exists on disk. These sectors may be added to the
    list of initial sectors by selecting them with the mouse and then clicking the button
    labelled '&gt;' . Likewise, sectors may be removed from being initially loaded by
    selecting them in the right-hand list of initial sectors and clicking the '&lt;'
    button.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any number of available sectors may be set to be initially loaded or removed from
    being initially loaded. Note: Sector(0,0) may also be removed from the list of initial
    sectors.
