    Painting on the Terrain
  </h1>
  <p>
    Once a terrain has been created, it can be modified using the Terrain Editor Panel.
    The 'Terrain Editor Panel' must be visible to modify the terrain, which can be opened
    by clicking 'View'-&gt;'Terrain Editor Panel'.
  </p>
  <p>
    The terrain edit gizmo tool (<img src="images/tegt.png" />) enables the ability
    to edit the terrain including the ability to paint onto the terrain both materials
    and sculpting modifications (deformations). Several brush elements are present to
    allow a variety of painting actions. When the terrain edit gizmo tool is selected,
    a brush overlay will appear on the terrain where the mouse is pointing:
  </p>
  <div class="FigureContainer">
    <img alt="Mouse with brush overlay" src="images/mousebrushoverlay.png" />
    <p class="FigureCaption">
      Figure 1: <i>Mouse with brush overlay on the terrain</i></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Painting can alter terrain verticies (the terrain's underlying height-map) or terrain
    material layers (the terrain's coloring).
  </p>

  <h2>
    Terrain Editor Panel
  </h2>
  <p>
    Painting options are set using the Terrain Editor Panel. Once the options for the
    brush type are set and once an operation is selected, painting is a matter of point
    and click. Left clicking will perform the standard operation while holding the Ctrl
    button down will perform the alternate operation when it is available. Different
    operations have different options that depend on the type of operation as well as
    the part of the terrain they affect (geometry or materials).
  </p>
  <p>
    Some operations have options to procedurally limit the areas of the terrain on which
    the operation will operate. This can allow some complex and very useful operations
    to be performed with the painting. To learn more about the use of procedural filters,
    see the related documentation on these elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Generally, operations that affect the geometry only have operation specific options
    (strength, percentage...) while operations that affect the materials will have material
    selection options.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Combining Different Operations
  </h3>
  <p>
    Multiple brush elements may be active at once, combining to perform a series of
    operations sequentially. To add a brush to the list of active brushes, select a
    brush element from the brush elements list. If several brush elements are added
    to the list of active brushes, they will all be painted in the order they appear.
    For instance, a painting operation with multiple elements could be set to modify
    the elevation and the blending of a material layer at the same time. This could
    also be useful for creating rough hills by painting both elevation and sculpting
    noise, or for setting procedural filters to paint grass material on flat areas and
    rock material on steep angles.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Brush types
  </h3>
  <p>
    The brush type object identifies the points that are to be used in the painting
    operation and sorts them into the points that will receive the full operation and
    the points that will need to be interpolated (those in the falloff region of the
    brush). The standard brush type is circle brush type. It is composed of two circles.
    The points in the inner circle will be fully affected by an operation while the
    points between the inner circle and the outer circle (the falloff points) will only
    be affected by a certain amount. The radius of the inner and outer circles can be
    adjusted within the 'Brush Types' area either by using the sliders or associated
    text boxes. The radius dimensions may range in size from 0% to 100% of the brush
    size.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are several additional brush type options which allow for modifications to
    the brush. The brush size may be changed using the dropdown menu for 'Maximum Brush
    Size' and is displayed in terms of game units. There is also an 'Airbrush' option.
    When 'airbrush' is checked for a painting operation, the painting operation will
    continue to be applied to the terrain as long as the left mouse button is held down
    even if the mouse's position does not change. The option 'Display the material painting
    helper grid' is used to provide additional visual information when painting materials
    onto the terrain. When this option is checked during painting, it will show a red
    block over any cell if the currently chosen surface material cannot be painted there.
    There is currently a painting limit of four materials onto a cell.

  <h3>
    Procedural Filters
  </h3>
  <p>
    Procedural settings include the min and max height sliders define the elevations
    affected by a brush element, as well as the min and max slope sliders which specify
    the slope ranges which an operation will affect.
  </p>
  <h2>
  	Painting Materials
  </h2>
  <p>
  	The number of materials able to be used on a terrain is limited, so it is important to 
  	optimize how materials are used and distributed over a terrain. The terrain is limited 
  	to rendering a maximum of 4 materials on a given high detail cell. This allows many materials 
  	to be painted over the expanse of a terrain, however too much variation should not be placed 
  	in a single location.
  </p>
 	<p>
 		At the cost of a deeper tree traversal on the terrain (which will use more RAM and VRAM), 
 		the apparent cell size according to world space can be reduced. This will give the artist 
 		more flexibility when it comes to painting more materials in close proximity.
 	</p>
 	<h3>
 		Unpaintable Areas
 	</h3>
 	<p>
 		When painting on the terrain, it is important to know how many materials are present on a 
 		specific cell in order to avoid creating painting seams. In order to view which cells 
 		already have the maximum of 4 materials present, check the "Highlight unpaintable areas" 
 		option found in the Terrain Editor brush types menu.  When painting materials onto the 
 		terrain this will display a helper overlay that shows where the presently selected material 
 		cannot be painted by displaying a red highlight over the cell.  This does not indicate a 
 		painting error has occurred, but that painting the selected material is not allowed in 
 		already full cells.  The selected material can still be painted everywhere on the terrain 
 		except where the current material would be the fifth material present on a cell. Changing 
 		which material you are painting with will obviously change which cells, if any, are highlighted.  
 		To turn off the material painting helper, uncheck the "Highlight unpaintable areas" option at any 
 		point.

    <p class="FigureCaption">Figure: <i>Highlighting unpaintable areas where four materials 
    	are already present on a cell and the user is painting with a fifth material.</i></p>

  </div>
  
 	<h3>
 		Material context menu
 	</h3>
 	<p>
 		Right-clicking on a cell with any materials painted on it will bring up the context menu 
 		option "Remove Material."  Selecting this option will open another menu listing all of the 
 		materials presently painted onto that cell of the terrain.  Selecting any of these materials 
 		will remove them from the individual cell.  Note: this will generally leave sharp lines where 
 		painting stroke continues on neighboring cells; however it can be very useful when there is 
 		only a slight overlap onto a cell which needs four other materials painted onto it.   
 		Removing a material from an individual cell is an undoable action.  To remove a material 
 		on a larger scale, see the section titled <a href="wbt_materials.htm">"Removing a material from the terrain"</a>.
