    NiPhysXBodyDesc objects are for caching snapshots of NxBodyDesc objects,

        This object can store multiple sets of initial velocities for the
        actor. Any one of these may be used when creating an actor or an
        actor may be set to have one of these velocities on demand. The body
        is always assumed to have the same number of states as the
        NiPhysXActorDesc to which it is attached. Therefore, any call to
        NiPhysXActorDesc::SetPose should have a matching call to
        NiPhysXBodyDesc::SetVelocities if the actor is dynamic.
        
        Associated with each velocity is a sleep status. The actor will be set to sleep
        if the sleep status is true and the velocities are zero.

        If no velocities are provided, the actor is assumed to have zero
        angular and linear velocity.
