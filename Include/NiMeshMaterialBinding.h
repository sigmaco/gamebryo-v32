        Common code for creating a mesh material binding,
        shared by several renderers.

        Template parameter TContext allows platform implementations to add
        callbacks that implement platform specific code.

        Also, the derived context should add any additional "local" variables
        needed.

    /**
        A small struct used as the template argument to
        NiMeshMaterialBinding::CreateBinding.

        Each platform extends CreateBindingBaseContext to contain data members
        relevant to creating the binding for that platform. For example,
        NiDX9MeshMaterialBinding would invoke
        CreateBindingContext<DX9CreateBindingContext>. The subclass would
        include storage for an array of D3DVERTEXELEMENT9 objects necessary
        for creating a DX9 binding. Users are not expected to need to subclass
        CreateBindingBaseContext or interface with it directly.

            Since each platform must interface with the underlying graphics
            API, this function is called after each entry is added to the
            mesh material binding to create any platform specific
            data. For example, DX9CreateBindingContext would use this function

            that are used to create the instance of
            IDirect3DVertexDeclaration9 associated with the mesh material
