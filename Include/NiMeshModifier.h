/**
    This virtual class is the base for mesh modifiers. A mesh modifier is
    an object that is associated with an NiMesh object and performs dynamic
    changes to the mesh. Examples include morphing and skinning.

    Modifiers are designed to run in parallel with other Gamebryo processing,
    and contain information for synchronization with other engine activities.
    It is also possible to create modifiers that execute immediately.
