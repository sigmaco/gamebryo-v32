class NiPSParticleSystem;

/**
    Creates a new particle whose initial parameters are based on an existing
    particle.

    Each NiPSParticleSystem object owns a set of NiPSSpawner objects. It also
    references a "death spawner", which is used to spawn new particles when
    particles in that system are killed. Additionally, each NiPSCollider
    object can optionally reference a spawner from which particles should be
    spawned upon a collision.

    The spawner that is referenced by particle systems and particle colliders
    need not be owned by the same particle system. Thus, it is possible to
    spawn particles from a different particle system instead of from the
    current system. This allows spawned particles to look different from the
    original particles.

    Each time a particle is spawned, its generation value is incremented. The
    generation value is used by NiPSMeshParticleSystem objects to determine
    which master particle to use when emitting the particle. It is also used
    to grow and shrink particles over time.

    The number of particles to spawn can be set in this class, along with a
    randomization value. The speed, direction, and life span for spawned
    particles can also be randomized. All other particle parameters are copied
    from the original particle when a particle is spawned.

    The IDs of spawners are globally managed. At most 255 spawners may
    be in the application at any one time. After loading or otherwise
    creating 255 spawners, any attempt to add another spawner will
    assert in debug builds and fail in other configuration. Deleting a
    particle system and its spawners provides space for another spawner.
