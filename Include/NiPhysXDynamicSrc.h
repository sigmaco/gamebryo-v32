/**
    NiPhysXDynamicSrc objects are intended for pushing Gamebryo scene graph
    state to a PhysX dynamic or kinematic actor.

    These objects are used for both kinematic actors and actors that are
    dynamic (although the latter is not recommended). They also provide
    feedback of the blended state of a PhysX controlled character back to
    the PhysX actor doing the controlling.

    This class provides only the the UpdateToActors function. All member
    variables and other functionality are inherited from the base class.

    @note Interpolation will fail for fast rotating objects due to the
        fundamental limitations of rotation representations and discrete time
        sampling. Disable interpolation for fast moving objects.

        Push the state onto the PhysX actors.

        If the interpolation flag (defined in NiPhysXSrc) is false, this
        function uses the most recent internally cached transformation with
        either NxActor::moveGlobalPose or NxActor::setGlobalPose to set the
        actor's pose. If interpolation is active, then the pose is interpolated
        for time fTBegin for dynamic actors or fTEnd for kinematic actors.
        Regardless of the interpolation flag, when the actor
        is dynamic the velocity of the object is estimated using the two stored
        poses and is set with NxActor::setLinearVelocity and
        NxActor::setAngularVelocity.
