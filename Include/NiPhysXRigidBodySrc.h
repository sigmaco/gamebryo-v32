/**
    NiPhysXRigidBodySrc is an abstract base class for sources that extract
    state from a Gamebryo scene graph object and set state of a rigid body
    PhysX actor.

    Internally, this class stores the Gamebryo source node and the PhysX
    target actor, and the two most recent transformations extracted from
    the node, in PhysX coordinates. In other words, transformations that
    could be used directly to set the pose of the target actor. Also stored
    are the application times for the transformations for use when
    interpolating.

    This class is abstract because it does not implement
    NiPhysXSrc::UpdateToActors.

        the source has been updated twice. Calling UpdateFromSceneGraph with
