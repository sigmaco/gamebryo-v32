/**
    A destination object for transferring state from a PhysX rigid body actor
    to Gamebryo nodes associated with animation accumulation.

    A destination in the Gamebryo-PhysX package is a link between a PhysX
    actor that is producing state, and a Gamebryo scene graph object that
    is being driven by the physics. NiPhysXAccumRigidBodyDest is an abstract
    base class for destinations that extract and set rigid body state
    (rotation and translation) on two nodes that are doing transform
    accumulation in the Gamebryo animation system.

    Beyond functionality of its base class, this class adds flags to store
    the accumulation settings and a function to take a total transformation
    and break it into accumulated and non-accumulated portions. The latter
    is a protected member function available to sub-classes.

    @note This class is abstract because it does not implement
        NiPhysXDest::UpdateSceneGraph nor
        NiPhysXRigidBodyDest::GetSceneGraphParent().

        @name Accumulation control flags

        These functions allow you to get and set the flags that control
        how the accumulation is performed. Any flag that is true causes that
        portion of the transformation to be sent to the accumulation node,
        while false leaves the transformation component on the non-accumulated
        node. For rotation you must specify either none, one or all of the
        flags. The front facing flags inform the system of the front facing
        direction for the character. The ucAxis is 0 for X, 1 for Y and 2 for
        Z. However, only X and Y are respected by the system.
