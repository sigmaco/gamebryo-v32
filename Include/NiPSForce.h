/**
    The abstract base class for all particle forces.

    Multiple forces can be owned by an NiPSSimulatorForcesStep object, which
    is attached to the NiPSSimulator mesh modifier of a particle system. Each
    force provides a block of memory that contains the data it needs to
    properly execute. In its Update function, it updates that data as
    necessary. The NiPSSimulatorForcesStep object will concatenate the data
    from all its forces into a single data buffer that gets sent to a
    Floodgate kernel.

    In order to properly modify the particle velocity each frame, a function
    needs to be added for each force to the NiPSForceHelpers class. The
    NiPSSimulatorForcesKernel Floodgate kernel loops over all the forces,
    calling the helper function for each and providing that force's data
    buffer to that function. Each force's helper function is provided with the
    array of particle data and is expected to modify the velocity of each
    particle as necessary.

    The only information stored by this base class are the force name, the
    force type, and whether or not the force is active. It contains three pure
    virtual functions used to access the block of data for the force and to
    update the force parameters prior to execution in a Floodgate kernel.
