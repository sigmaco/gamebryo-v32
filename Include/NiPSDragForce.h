/**
    Applies a linear drag force to particles.

    The center of the force is represented by a drag object in the scene
    graph. A drag axis specified in the local space of the drag object
    represents the direction of the force.

    Any particles within the specified range of the drag object experience the
    full drag force. The force is linearly diminished from the range distance
    to the range falloff distance, after which the force does not affect any
    particles.

    This force most closely approximates the behavior of the Drag space warp
    in 3ds max.
