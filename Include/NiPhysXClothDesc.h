    /**
        @name Initial State Storage

        The descriptor can hold a number of initial conditions for the cloth.
        Each state is represented by a pose matrix, mapping onto the
        globalPose member of NxClothDesc, an array of cloth vertex
        locations, an ordered array of vertex indexes to tear at, and
        a corresponding array of normal vectors to use as tearing split planes
        (see the PhysX documentation on explicit cloth tearing).

        It is not necessary to supply both a pose and the vertex positions.
        When no vertex positions are given, the pose is used to transform the
        vertex locations in the original cooked cloth mesh to produce
        this piece of cloth's locations. If vertex positions are supplied,
        there must be as many vertex positions as the number of original
        vertices plus the number of torn vertices.

        Vertex positions have priority over the pose because they are set
        on the cloth after it has been created, while the pose is only used
        at creation. Typically, if the pose for a state is non-identity,
        then vertex positions will not be given and the cooked mesh vertex
        locations will be used. This is adequate if the cloth has not been
        deformed from its cooked state.

        The vertex positions do not modify the rest
        length of the edges in the cloth nor the angles between vertices -
        such things are cooked into the NxClothMesh object and cannot be
        changed after cooking. The distances between vertices should therefore
        be reasonably close to the rest shape of the cloth in order to avoid
        very large forces when simulation starts.
