/**
    Abstract base class for a single step in the particle system simulation
    process.

    Each simulator step encapsulates a Floodgate kernel that performs an
    aspect of the particle simulation. During its Update function, each step
    has the chance to suspend execution of its Floodgate kernel based on
    various criteria.

    This class stores sets of associated Floodgate streams and semantics.
    These stream/semantic pairs are used by the NiPSSimulator mesh modifier
    to re-arrange streams on the step to ensure the proper ordering during
    Floodgate execution. In the Attach function for derived classes, any
    streams that refer to shared particle data should be constructed and added
    using the protected AddInput and AddOutput functions in this class. This
    will pass ownership of these streams to the NiPSSimulator object and allow
    it to re-arrange them as necessary. Additionally, the semantics used for
    streams that reference particle data should come from NiPSCommonSemantics.
    The PrepareInputStream and PrepareOutputStream functions must be
    implemented in each derived class to handle initializing these shared
    streams properly.

    The Attach function is called when the NiPSSimulator object is attached
    to the particle system. This function should be used to add any locally
    owned streams (not shared streams) directly to the Floodgate task. This
    function is called before PrepareInputStream and PrepareOutputStream, so
    any streams added here should be handled first in the kernel.

    The Detach function is called when the NiPSSimulator object is detached
    from the particle system. Derived classes should set all their pointers to
    shared Floodgate streams to NULL in this function. They should be sure to
    call the base class version of Detach, though, which ensures that the
    array of streams and semantics stored in this class are properly emptied.

    A pure virtual function, GetKernel, exists that is called by the
    NiPSSimulator object to get the Floodgate kernel associated with the step.
    The GetLargestInputStride function should be implemented to return the
    largest stride of all the input streams used by the step. This value is
    used by NiPSSimulator to compute the optimal block count for the Floodgate
    task using the kernel.

    The Update function should be used to initialize any data in locally owned
    streams, update the block count of shared streams to match the number of
    active particles, and determine whether or not execution of the kernel
    should be skipped due to various factors.
