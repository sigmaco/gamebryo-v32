/**
    NiPhysXSequenceManager objects interface between an NiControllerManager
    object and a NiPhysXProp object to automatically manage the activation
    and de-activation of NiPhysX and PhysX objects as animations are activated
    and de-activated in the Gamebryo Animation System.

    This class is intended for situations in which a character or object is
    sometimes key-frame animated and sometimes physically active, such as a
    rag-doll. The object is set up with a NiControllerManager object and an
    NiPhysXProp object. Connections, in the form of NiPhysXDynamicSrc objects,
    are established between all the physics objects in the prop and all the
    scene graph objects in sequences controlled by the manager. These are
    used to feed animated state back to PhysX. An application then explicitly
    identifies some NiSequenceData objects as "physics controlled", and
    NiPhysXPoseBufferDest objects are created to tie the PhysX actors to
    pose buffer data items for the sequence. This allows PhysX to provide
    input to animation blends, or to drive the character outright.

    When the character is key-frame animated, the NiPhysXSequenceManager
    object activates the NiPhysXDynamicSrc objects to drive physics with the
    animation. When one of the "physics" sequences is activated, the
    NiPhysXPoseBufferDest objects are activated to provide the physics
    input and the NiPhysXDynamicSrc object for that scene graph node is
    disabled. The PhysX actors are automatically switched back to kinematic
    control when they are not driving any physical sequences.

    The result of all this is efficient and stable mixing of physics control
    with animated sequences, using the standard Gamebryo animation system.

    @note Cloning: NiPhysXSequenceManager objects cannot be cloned - it is
        cheaper to create a new one from scratch. To clone an entire character
        and its physics, start by cloning the NiActorManager object or
        NiControllerManager object which clones the character's scene graph.
        Then, clone the NiPhysXProp object representing the character's physics
        using the same NiCloningProcess object as was used for the scene graph.
        This must be done before the original NiPhysXProp object is associated
        with any NiPhysXSequenceManager object. If you clone a prop object that
        is already associated with a NiPhysXSequenceManager object you will
        also clone all of the sources and destinations added by that manager,
        which you must not do. Finally, create a new NiPhysXSequenceManager
        object and call SetManager on it.
