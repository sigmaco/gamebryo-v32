/**
    Generates rotated, screen-facing quads for a particle system.

    Each quad is composed of two triangles. Each vertex has a normal and
    optionally a color. Rotation angles may or may not be available. Quads
    are rotated about their screen-facing normal by the rotation angle.
    A positive rotation angle results in a clockwise rotation.
