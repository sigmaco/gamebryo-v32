/**
    The NiPhysXClothModifier class is used to deform a Gamebryo mesh according
    to data in a NxCloth object.

    A modifier of this type must be attached to any NiMesh object that is the
    target of PhysX cloth simulation. Between simulation steps, the modifier
    sets the data streams of the mesh so that it matches the PhysX cloth mesh
    structure and location. When the cloth is not sleeping, the transformation
    of the target Gamebryo node is not modified - everything is done by moving
    mesh vertices. If the cloth is sleeping, the Gamebryo mesh is not modified
    but the node may have its transformation modified if sleep transforms are
    active (see below).

    The sync points for this modifier depend on the structure of the main game
    loop. In cases where PhysX is simulating in parallel with rendering
    (asynchronous simulation), the modifier should be submitted when simulation
    completes (which will be early in a frame) and completed when the next
    simulation step begins, which by definition is before rendering during
    asynchronous simulation. On the other hand, when simulation is
    synchronous, the modifier is submitted when visible and completed at
    render. It is important to be certain that the modifier does not execute
    inside a PhysX simulate/fetch block.

        In addition to the cloth object, the function also takes an array of
        vertex indices and the mesh that the modifier is associated with. The
        index array is a mapping from Gamebryo vertex indices to PhysX cloth
        indices: the ith entry in the array gives the PhysX mesh vertex index
        corresponding to the ith Gamebryo mesh vertex. This mapping may
        be may-to-one depending on mesh topology.

        The arrays in the NxMeshData object associated with the cloth are
        allocated by this function.

        When the cloth is set on the modifier, the data streams on the mesh may
        be resized to accommodate growth from torn vertices. The final size
        is determined by the mesh growth factor (see SetMeshGrowFactor).
        If the data streams are resized, all of the modifiers on the mesh are
        reset. Regardless, the Attach function is called on this modifier
        because it may not have succeeded previously.

        The cloth object may be set to NULL, in which case the modifier is
        detached.

        When a cloth object is set on the modifier, extra space may be
        allocated for all USAGE_VERTEX data streams on the mesh to make space
        for vertices added through tearing. This value controls how much
        space is added: a value of 1.0 means no additional space, while
        1.5 means 50% more space and 2.0 means twice as much
        space. Set this value to 1.0 if the cloth will never tear.

        The default is 1.5 if the cloth has tearing enabled, or 1.0 if tearing
        is disabled on the cloth when the SetCloth function is called
        (including when a prop containing the cloth is instantiated in a
        PhysX scene). If a value is explicitly specified before the cloth is
        set, that value is retained. The value from the original cloth is
        used if the cloth object is replaced.

        This function may need to be used when the tearing
        flags on the cloth are changed after the modifier is set up with the
        cloth, particularly if going from non-tearable to tearable. The cost
        of a change is significant because data streams are replaced on the
