/**
    NiPhysXRigidBodyDest is an abstract base class for destinations that
    extract and set rigid body state (rotation and translation).

    A destination in the Gamebryo-PhysX package is a link between a PhysX
    actor that is producing state, and a Gamebryo scene graph object that
    is being driven by the physics.

    Internally, this class stores a PhysX actor, it actor parent if it has one,
    and the two most recent transformations extracted from that actor. Also
    stored are the application times for the transformations for use when
    interpolating.

    The actor parent is a PhysX actor object that corresponds to the
    scene graph parent of this destination's target node.

    If the actor parent is known, the stored transformation state is the
    relative transformation between the actor and its parent (used for
    jointed objects). Otherwise global state is stored. All stored states
    are pre-scaled by the Gamebryo-PhysX relative scale.

    A protected member function, GetTransforms, is used by the
    UpdateSceneGraph to compute the Gamebryo scene graph transform for a
    node or interpolator. The extracted transformation depends on the
    presence of the various parent pointers. All computations are designed
    to get the best estimate for the local transformation from the actor's
    coordinate system to its parents, as required by Gamebryo.

    First, the actor parent is checked. If pkActorParent is non-NULL, then
    the stored transform is the parent actor's inverse transform composed
    with the actor's transform.

    In the absence of a parent actor, the protected function
    NiPhysXRigidBodyDest::GetSceneGraphParent() is called to find the scene
    graph parent of the Gamebryo node the class is driving. Derived classes
    must implement this function. If the returned parent is non-NULL, then
    the stored transform is the parent node's inverse transform composed with
    the actor's Gamebryo global transform, which is computed by composing
    kRootTransform with the actor's pose.

    If neither parent is available, then the Gamebryo global transformation
    is used, which is computed by composing kRootTransform with the actor's
    pose.

    This class is abstract because it does not implement
    NiPhysXDest::UpdateSceneGraph or NiPhysXRigidBodyDest::GetSceneGraphParent.

        Constructor.

        The constructor sets state common to rigid body destinations. The

        transforms, and the extraction times for those transformations are set
        to be in the past.

        @param pkActor The PhysX actor from which to extract state.
        @param pkActorParent The parent of pkActor. It must be some actor
            in the PhysX scene that has the same pose as the controlled
            node's parent in the scene graph. For example, if pkActor is
            representing a character's lower arm, pkActorParent should be
            the actor for the upper arm, presuming the arms have a
            parent-child relationship in the Gamebryo scene graph. This value
            will be NULL for objects not connected to others in a hierarchical
            linkage.

        Get the sleep optimization flag.

        An optimization is possible if an actor is sleeping and its
        state does not need to be pushed to the Gamebryo scene graph.
        In order to use this optimization the global transformation for
        the object in the Gamebryo scene graph must also be unchanging.
        This is typically not the case for anything involved in an animated
        hierarchy. For instance, rag-doll bones cannot be sleep optimized
        because their parents in the skeleton may still be moving. This flag
        is false by default.
