/**
    The NiMorphMeshModifier class provides the ability to morph streams of
    data from one data set to another. Specifically, it performs
    linear-weighted blending between a set of target data streams. The current
    implementation assumes that the data stream format is F_FLOAT32_3 or
    F_FLOAT16_4.

    If multiple semantics are to be morphed, it is assumed that all semantics
    have the same number of morph targets and that the same weights are
    used for all semantics.

    The target data are assumed to be present as streams on the mesh that
    this modifier is attached to, named as determined by
    MorphElementSemantic(). The target vertices can be interpreted as either
    a set of independent targets or as a set of offsets from a base target.
    The first target stream is always assumed to be the base mesh for all of
    the offset targets. The target data streams must have ACCESS_CPU_READ.

    The destination data stream(s) must be present and have CPU_WRITE_VOLATILE
    or CPU_WRITE_MUTABLE access.

    The weights are taken from another stream on the mesh, with semantic
    MORPHWEIGHTS. This stream must be present for the modifier to successfully
    attach to the mesh. There must be at least as many weights as there are
    morph targets. Typically, the mesh will have an NiMorphWeightsController
    object attached to control the weights. That class is found in the
    NiAnimation library.

    In addition, the following assumptions are made: The data format must be
    F_FLOAT32_3 or F_FLOAT16_4; data streams must have only one region.

    @ps3_begin On the PS3, each of the morphed elements must be in its
    own single-element data stream. Since output streams are not DMA'd to
    the SPUs by Floodgate, interleaved data would otherwise be lost.@ps3_end
